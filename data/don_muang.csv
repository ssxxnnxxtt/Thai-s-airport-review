0,"Haven't flown from here for 3 years due to covid, it's always been decent and I've found it relatively smooth but the website is way out of date, very disappointing for an international airport. Customer service desk was also very unhelpful, they no longer have 24 hour left luggage and no longer have bag wrapping, this left me stuck having to pay for excess luggage I didn't want to carry around Indonesia with me and of course meant extra expense. Ok both legs of my journey, check in was OK as was passport control but my flight was one of the last out at night so was relatively quiet anyway, only restaurant was McDonalds which I don't eat, a couple of coffee stalls with few sandwiches etc.. I don't understand why when you still have flights going everything pretty much shuts except for duty free!",6.0
1,"The domestic terminal is better than the international, seemingly having been refurbished during Covid. Both have adequate food options. Plenty of seating. Clean. Domestic departures. At security beware the overzealous and brusque female personnel with their metal detector wands. A small coin inadvertently left in a pocket will immediately incur their wrath. Perhaps their rigorous practical training could also include occasional use of the words 'please' and 'thank you'. Polite manners to avoid confrontations are as important when dealing with foreigners as they are with the locals. International departures: leave plenty of time for passport control and security which is efficient but there can be long queues. At last, the the BTS runs out to Don Muang and the station is not too far away - making the old taxi lottery system a thing of the past.",5.0
2,"I think Don Muang is much more beautiful than before including terminal 1 and I only walked quite a short way to gate, I want AOT to increase the other pier or expand the old pier (increase gate), especially the bus gate. Arrival: when I landed I just walked a short way but I think the walkway looked like a dimensional tunnel. Queuing was so long and bus gate was cramped.",9.0
3,"On the 4th of March, I was flying back to Bangkok from Tokyo. At the end of an 8 hour flight with N95 masks, I was exhausted, and didn't do the usual ""always look back the trolley"" search that I normally would. I didn’t realize it until I was getting ready the next morning, that I have lost my expensive skincare that I bought for mom as a gift. Brand new and properly packed in the duty free bag. I panicked and thought there was no hope that I would find the goods. I called the airport just to try our luck. The airport staff told me to describe the items that we lost and would contact us after checking with the lost and found department. Only a few moments later, the airport called me that they found my items at the lost and found. A janitor had turned them in. We can arrange to collect the items anytime. It all seemed crazy to me because the items were in perfect condition. I was so grateful and could not believe that my stuff would be able to be found. The airport staff were extremely helpful and nice. It made my day and I still feel so thankful even until today.",10.0
4,Absolute trash customer service. Accidentally packed my 100ml DFS item into my carry on bag. Staff was very rude when telling me to dispose of the item. I was already super upset and yet she was not empathetic. Took out my smaller bottle wanting to refill my small bottle with the DFS item. She was being unreasonable and said I couldn't do so because my bottle didn’t specify 100ml,1.0
5,"Great experience. Almost zero queues at immigration in and out, minimal wait for baggage. Good facilities. Clean. No wait for taxi downtown. Lots of seating. Reasonable WiFi. Pleasantly surprised. Much better than BKK, which was horrendous last time I went through.",10.0
6,Very good organisation. Quite quick drop-off. Very smooth passport and security control. Terminal clean enough. All directions presented clear. Shopping offer limited.,7.0
7,"I had an issue with bringing in an so-called prohibited item at Thailand Don Muang airport to board the plane via carry on baggage. Never faced restriction for this item on any other international airports such as Singapore, Penang or even in Hat Yai. The item is Baj used by Sikhs for their Turban. The security staff of the airport asked me to get the airline staff to come and discuss with them if they would allow or able to help me in any way to bring on the item either through check-in baggage or any other way. When approached to the Thai Air Asia staff at the departure Gate 5 for help, they rudely responded that if the security said it is prohibited then we cannot do anything without even trying to talk with the security staff. Then when asked if there was any way to bring in the item maybe through check-in baggage then they further rudely responded that all the baggage had been loaded into the plane and told me to cancel the flight and there will not be any refund. The Thai Air Asia staff at the departure gate 5 were extremely rude and not helping at all especially the male staff who even raised their voice to us instead of truly finding a way to help or politely explain that they are not in position to help us. With such service I'm definitely not going for Thai Air Asia ever again. Happened on November 9 for Flight FD 401 from Thailand, Don Muang airport to Malaysia, Penang airport. Flight pick up time 1.30pm. Date of travel: November 9, 2019.",1.0
8,Very impressed with this place - used to be terrible but now much better than the other local airport. Fast checking security and immigration. Lots of food and drinks outlets. Plenty of seating. All in all a dream.,9.0

10,"I've seen a lot of moaning about this airport, and it doesn't match my experience at all. Yes, it's old and run-down. It could do with a paint and a clean-up. But it's the budget airline terminal: if you want something fancy, pay more for your flight and be disappointed by Suvarnabhumi. I arrived at this airport on Air Asia from KL at about 9pm. We landed 30 minutes early, taxied for two minutes, and were connected almost immediately to an airbridge. We deplaned faster than I've ever seen before. There was no queue for immigration, but there was a slight delay because I had to go to a counter to ask for an immigration form: there were none in the queuing area and they were not handed out on the plane. So getting through immigration took me five minutes, including two minutes to fill out the form. By the time I got to the baggage hall, an official told me that our bags had all been taken off the carousel and were on the floor awaiting collection. Mine was there. There was then no queue for a taxi. I was in a taxi on the motorway before I was actually scheduled to land. Departure was on Scoot to Singapore, a week later, mid-afternoon. The check-in area was very crowded. There was a 5-minute queue for check-in for my flight. I then had a five-minute queue for passport control, and two or three minutes for baggage scans. That was it. I was through. Food options are limited, but there is a McDonald's, which was fine, and which charged normal McDonald's prices. I was able to get a seat there with no problem. The gate area was quite peaceful, with plenty of seats and plenty of recharging stations, and a good view of the apron. We pushed back 5 minutes early. Don Muang is not pretty. But, for me at least, it was efficient. Suvarnabhumi, on the other hand, is grand, but it's too big, it's horrible to get around, and immigration and security are slow and inefficient. And the food options are abysmal. Given the choice, I'd choose Don Muang over Suvarnabhumi every time.",7.0
11,Be warned of slow immigration. I was stuck at immigration for over 1 hour before my flight. Not enough counters to process the passengers. Would have missed my flight had I not approached an immigration officer to use the ‘fast track’.,3.0
12,"The airport is very run down. It is not equipped to handle the number of travellers using it. The lines are chaotic and unbelievably long. Because of this confusion, I left my iPad in a bin going through security. I hope I can get it when I am there again in a couple of days. However in the future I will avoid this airport. It needs a cleaning and a facelift and overhaul to handle the number of people using it.",3.0
13,"Queuing times very long when arriving. Over one hour in the queue to get to immigration official. Dilapidated buildings which didn't worry me, however much needs to be done to process passengers efficiently.",3.0
14,"The worst airport ever. A literal proletarian hellhole. It takes forever for immigration to process one person. Most of the counters are closed, yet you can see some ground staff walking around leisurely with nothing to do. When someone requested for an extra counter to be opened to deal with the longer lines, we heard the staff rudely asking him to bear with it or get lost. Horrible work ethics displayed, I have never seen such rude behaviour from airport staff in all my years of travelling internationally. The airport itself is run down and shabby with little to offer in terms of facilities. Makes me wonder why I even have to pay the airport tax for this kind of ridiculous service. Food at the airport is overpriced like all other airports. Thailand is a lovely country but this horrible airport experience definitely makes me think twice about coming back.",1.0
15,Security staff has very bad attitude problems. It is chaos everywhere. The staff does not have adequate English skills. There is not enough equipment for security checks. It is a very bad overall experience.,1.0
16,"International arrivals immigration chaotic, disorganised, massive queues, half the channels closed, takes 5 minutes for each traveller to be processed. Some people ignored the lines and just jumped the queue - disgusting, officials just ignored it. Waited 90 mins to get through, complete nightmare. Will never fly into this place again, will definitely use Suvarnabhumi.",2.0
17,Considering tourism is one of Thailand’s main exports then I’m amazed to find such a low quality airport as Don Muang. Had to spend 3 hours here waiting for our connecting flight to Singapore. The airport seems run down with very little restaurant or bar offering. Amazing in a world where countries compete giving their guests an excellent service. Thailand is a lovely country but unfortunately we have to come thru an airport like Don Muang.,2.0
18,"I travel a lot and this is just the most horrible airport I had to depart. You have to be very careful as checking in , passing immigration and gettng your luggage sceened can take 4 hours and in very crowded queues!",2.0
19,"The airport is not as big as the BKK so is easier and faster to get around. It was clean, with some shops and a lot of light. Prices weren't expensive and had a good air-conditioning.",10.0
20,"The worst airport I have ever passed through, arriving in Don Muang after mignight with a late flight. Huge queue of upset tourists waiting for passing immigration, 70% of the counters are close which make our waiting time about 2h15min, that is so shameful. Even Indian airports are better organized at night, it used to be good 5/6 years ago.",3.0
21,"I was not pleased with the chaos of this airport. People were lined up in a bizarre pattern that extended beyond the normal ropes and some people in line were not going to the same places and thus started some uncomfortable banter between them. When I wanted to exchange my money, they only had very large bills when I requested for smaller, since I believe it is unsafe and impractical to have only large bills during travel. You should buy the baggage (suitcase) services no matter what since I got charged 2400 bhat for mine even though it was not over 10kg.",2.0
22,"What a terrible experience! Landed in Don Muang 20 minutes ahead of schedule (domestic flight) and the whole lot of passengers had to wait over 45 minutes for baggage to be delivered. When asked, Thai Lion Air couldn't really be bothered. Then a chap took my bag instead of his, luckily he realised his mistake while jumping in a cab. Was a hassle to get back inside the baggage area to get my bag. I wasted almost 2 hours, not happy.",4.0
23,"One of the worst airports to fly in and out of, and I fly a lot. Especially international arrival which is always a nightmare. Staff tell people where to queue up for immigration, then promptly closes a desk and yells at people to merge queues. I got moved twice and others who arrived after me go through customs long before me. And then you get to the queue for the taxis, which often takes at least 30 mins of waiting. BKK is a much better experience than DMK, so if you have the choice go for BKK.",4.0
24,"This is hands down the worst airport to visit (and I visit a lot of them, this one is even worse than KLIA despite that one not allowing solo travellers to bring their luggage to the toilet). At least this time the immigration queues were manageable but they do not even have an ATM in the departure lounge! How are we supposed to know this in advance? I needed to take out US dollars to pay for the visa in the next country and it was impossible without me leaving the departure terminal - which I did not have time to do. Nothing ever works smoothly here (and no this wasn’t convenient to do before departure to Bangkok).",1.0
25,After reading all of the negative reviews about this airport I left my hotel near Hua Lamphong (25 kilometers away) at 3.20am for a 6.40am international flight to Vietnam. Maybe I was really lucky but I was at the boarding gate at 4.15am.,9.0
26,"Departing on an international flight from this airport is almost a nightmare come true. Pandemonium, failing air conditioners, not enough seats. The place is a mess. Arriving here is a bit less chaotic and certainly less painful. Smiles seem to have been left out front somewhere. No one seems happy to be here, and that includes the staff and the the flyers.",2.0
27,Worst airport ever. Every single time I have come to this airport I had worst experience. Staff are really unprofessional. Full of attitude. Talking so arrogantly. No assistance for people with children. I am never ever ever going to come this country ever again. Staff doesn’t know how to talk to customers. Ruined my entire journey.,1.0
28,"Arrival surprisingly good although I did manage to walk fast so entered security ahead of a large bunch of incoming Chinese hence a very fast admission to the country. The airport was generally clean in the main arrivals area and I used some of the excellent services in the nearby domestic arrivals zone. Departure was significantly more disappointing with a good 500 minimum people trying to queue outside of the immigration area. The queue was slightly haphazard and it took one hour to arrive at the passport exit control area (all passport controls were open and the staff were working efficiently and friendly). Another 30 minute queue for security which was not helped by the overtly noisy mannerisms of one staff member who enjoyed shouting out the phrase ""one by one"" in a very demeaning and unprofessional way. Apart from that and very busy with Chinese queuing for their VAT refund it was generally okay.",6.0
29,"Functional airport, busy, efficient. Shopping OK enough to get food and drinks. Security scan in domestic is a joke, gel, liquid to be passed. No more smoking rooms in domestic terminal. Shame.",7.0
30,"Bangkok Don Muang is a weird contradiction - huge empty spaces, with the functions of the airport jammed into congested corners. Check-in with Air Asia in early evening was a joke. Huge numbers of passengers in chaotic queues with many unmanned desks available. What is the point of checking in online only to have to queue 1.5 hours to drop your bag? Immigration and Security was a similar shambles with little queue management and not enough staff to manage the volume of passengers. Poor and over priced eating options in the departure area and the place could use a good clean. Arrivals experience was better apart from the lengthy walk. A few minutes wait in Immigration and no delay in the baggage hall - and miraculously no queues for taxis. Reminds me more of a very large, poorly organised bus station, rather than an airport.",3.0
31,"Cleanliness much to be desired. Slow Check-in. Baggage check staff busy laughing and chatting rather than processing the queue in an efficient and fast manner. Ventilation in smoking area is broken, it's like entering a furnace chimney. No outlets available anywhere. Good luck if you're low on battery. One of the most visited countries in the world, competing for the worst airport experience possible. They couldn't care less about negative reviews, it won't stop tourists from flowing in.",1.0
32,"After 4 arrivals at DMK airport in the last few months, the immigration queues were chaotic with long lines. Completely understaffed and poorly managed. Baggage claim was a complete mess. AOT is usually very good with streamlining lines and speeding processes. Adding 10-15 more immigration officers should reduce the long queues.",5.0
33,"Basically the same experience as Abe Sumio on the same day. 1.5+ hour long wait with only 2 lanes open (out of 10) while a number of staff members stood at the back throughout this time socialising (with occasional interruptions to tell the front of the queue where to stand). The problem is not lack of staff, it is that a number of them are not doing anything. There are manned queues which are empty majority of the time which no one bothering to redirect the foreigner queues to them.",1.0
34,"Absolute disaster getting through the immigration queue - multiple hours long, including over an hour from the point at which a sign proclaims 15 minutes waiting time. Multiply the stated waiting times by 4. This airport is thoroughly disorganized - basically total chaos. Nowhere near enough immigration officers for the foreigners queue, and the immigration officers that are present are exceedingly slow, as if they are mentally challenged. Flying into this airport should be avoided at all costs - it's so pathetically bad, words cannot really describe it.",1.0
35,Terrible immigration experience; going through customs took nearly 1h30min. With few hundred travellers queuing there was only one immigration booth open for the entire duration of the wait. This was for ASEAN queue but the “foreigner” wasn’t much better with a queue of approx 45-60min.,1.0
36,"I have travelled in and out of Don Muang airport at least 20 times. Maybe twice I have had a reasonably quick arrival or departure experience, every other time it is chaotic. Definitely ranks as one of the busiest airports and not a good place to be. If you can avoid it at all costs, unless you can get a flight in or out when its in a quiet patch. Anybody that reviews it and says its good either a) Doesn't travel through here much or b) Is being paid to write good things or c) Lucked out in a quiet patch or d) You are Thai in which you have eGate and its quick. Come on Thailand, you're not doing visitors to your country a good service by having such appalling airport facilities. Staff are just overworked and unhappy, open more kiosks, look after your guests, land of smiles right?",2.0
37,"DMK is pretty much a hot mess. From the lack of public transit options for getting to and from, to the atrociously long lines at immigration, I will gladly pay for a more expensive flight just to avoid DMK. I realize that much of immigration is based on flight arrival times, but DMK was chaotic, as compared to BKK at. a similar time (1.30pm). We were through BKK and to Sukhimvit is about 1 hour, even with luggage pickup, compared to 2.5 hours at DMK, with only carryons. Never again.",3.0
38,"This review is solely relating to the domestic terminal. This is an excellent terminal, everything works, power sockets, numerous shops and restaurants, efficient AC and, despite being busy there were plenty of seats. One issue - flight announcements. Not only are they too loud and frequent but the Thai is generally spoken too fast and the English is poor (hey-this is Thailand). The announcements from Air Asia were also made in a similar fashion in the long (400m) corridor on the approach to the gate waiting areas, pointless and noisy!",8.0
39,"This airport still suffers from problems of painfully long immigration queues caused primarily by a lack of immigration officers. Also there seems to be a lack of controls on queues at Don Muang Airport meaning some devious people can cut in line. What is also annoying is the fact there are plenty of lanes open for passengers from ASEAN countries and Thai Nationals that are staffed with hardly any queue at all yet they never offer non-ASEAN or Thai passengers the chance to use these lanes during busy times. In the departures lounge there is a decent array of shopping and eating options which does somewhat help alleviate the pain of immigration and security at this airport. However many departure gates are overcrowded with insufficient seating and often passengers need to be bused out to the plane across the tarmac, which in my case took about 10 minutes because we had to travel right across the airport concourse. I therefore advise people to be very wary about using this airport especially during a major Chinese Holiday when there is a huge influx of Chinese visitors. If you have any issues with anger management, stress or anxiety then definitely don't use this airport.",3.0
40,"I went through the visa on arrival process as an tourist, it took me more than two hours at the end. The attitude of the girl at the immigration is unacceptable, she laughs at you once she found you made a small mistake and shouted if you could not understand her poor English. She would ask you to rebook the connecting ticket if your receipt was not in English! Deliberately made troubles with your address. You need to queue 3-4 times to get out. I would say this is my worst experience in the airport. There’s no way to make a complaint! Made a very bad first impression of Thailand!",1.0
41,Had to queue for over 3 hours to get a stamp for visa free arrival. No order whatsoever and with more planes arriving the queue was only getting worse. I will never arrive at this airport again. However in saying that apparently the other International airport has also been experiencing issues. Not great for tourism at all.,1.0
42,"The flight landed into Bangkok Don Muang at 1:20am on Sunday 6 August 2017, but my son did not pass through the immigration quques and exit into the greeting area until 5:30am. That was nearly a 4 hour queue at the immigration desk, along with hundreds (thousands) more other frustrated passengers. The Airport Authority of Thailand only refer to a hitch on a couple of days prior to this, on Friday and Saturday, but the situation continued on Sunday as well. Soon after my son landed there were another 6 scheduled flights to land within the next hour, and from the Arrivals Board they were arriving pretty much on time - meaning the queues would get a lot worse and they would probably experience a 5-hour queue wait. It was a bad experience and it will definitely put people off travelling through Don Muang and probably from travelling to Thailand as well.",1.0
43,"Bangkok Don Mueang immigration is a total mess unworthy of an international airport. I used this airport several times for flights in Thailand and where I do not have to go through immigration on the way back, that was OK. But last time I came back from Singapore late in the evening, and I had to wait more than 2h30 in a completely disorganized queue to go through immigration. And now I hear that a few days later, the situation was even worse! Looks like both the airport authorities and immigration do not care about this situation. If they want to retain the status of ""international airport"", they need to increase the capacity for dealing with foreign passagers at immigration and organize the queue system like in Suvarnabhumi. In Suvarnabhumi the queues at immigration can sometimes seem impressive, but once you are in the queue, things progress steadily and in a well organized manner. And the immigration officers are efficient and professional. In Don Mueang, it's ""dog eat dog"" with people trying to cut the queue and switching queues to gain, especially once the big mainland Chinese travel groups arrive. And most officers at immigration do not care at all about the mess. Only 1 in 2 counters were open, but there seemed to be a number of officers available behind. So why don't they open more counters when there is such a mess? The excuse for the 4 hours wait last Friday apparently is 4 late arriving planes. They say they can only deal with 1000 foreign passengers in one hour. Four planes in Don Mueang, that's at best 600-800 passengers. This situation is most probably very detrimental to tourism in Thailand, a country that really needs it's tourism industry. Elsewhere, something like this happens, heads will start to roll. An arrival area such as this does not give a good impression of Thailand and certainly does not provide the feeling that you are arriving in a developed country which cares about the tourists bringing money into the country. Bottom line, next time I will plan a trip out of Thailand and back, I might still leave from Don Mueang as my wife lives close by, but I will definitely book a flight back to Suvarnabhumi where immigration works. Sorry Air Asia, but there are competitors that fly to Suvarnabhumi at quite competitive prices. Arriving in Suvarnabhumi I might have had the time to go from Suvarnabhumi to Don Mueang and back at least twice during my wait at Don Mueang Immigration.",3.0
44,It was my worst experience at an airport. My flight from Bangkok Don Muang was delayed and there is no smoking room. Food and beverage prices are high and quality is bad. When I arrived the queue for immigration was very long and no one tried to manage this . Some tourists told me they waited for 3 hours.,1.0
45,"Don Muang Immigration queues - nightmare! (Arrived and departed in June). You are very likely to miss your connecting flights, if you booked a different airline. There is no co-ordination at the immigration hall. There are nowhere near enough staff to process the huge waves of people that are backlogged. There are empty immigration desks, with staff walking around in the back, not wanting to acknowledge or look at the massive lines they were not helping to process. The lines were wall to wall, super long, and not moving. They even closed desks when there were clearly like a thousand people in line. I am a very cautious planner, and had budgeted a connecting flight over 3.5 hours after landing and I still just barely made my flight. I had stood in line looking at my watch patiently for an hour. Moved about 15 people, in a line of probably 70-100 people. The immigration hall was full of a sea of people, people cutting lines, walking up and down trying to cut or see why nobody was moving forward. I even saw two immigration desks close down in the middle of the mayhem. Yet, the head honcho guy was just smiley, ignoring the very unhappy crowded lines in front of him, and just chatting up the rest of the staff at different desks that were trying to process the people. He was distracting them. After standing in line for 2 hours, going nowhere, I started getting nervous. After another 30 minutes, I had to literally beg some people at the beginning of the line to let me through, otherwise, I would miss my flight. At first they didn't want to let me through, because they had been waiting probably longer than I had and thought I was skipping all the way to the front after just arriving. I showed them the chronometer on my stopwatch which was still running which showed 2.5 hours and counting (the check-in desk for my connecting flight closes 45 mins before departure.) And they got that I had also suffered the hours of wasted time along with them. Thank you to those two families. There were no Airport staff that was willing to help with my timely predicament, even when I was able to grab someone. They spoke English, but talked to other staff, and no one knew what to do. They just said get back in line, or you have to ask the people in front. So, I did just that, without their assistance. I vowed not to go through Don Muang Airport again, if I can. No one seems to care if arriving passengers make connecting flights or not.",1.0
46,"The airport immigration is a disaster! Arrived at 12.30am and did not clear immigration until more than 5 hours later! There were no queues! It was just crowds all pushing towards a handful of open immigration counters. From the end of the crowd, you can't see which counters are open and which are not. You can only push forward until you are close to the front before you can see that the counter is closed and have to head towards the nearest next counter, pushing together with the crowd. Everybody was hot and sweaty. It was a horrendous experience. Any other country, Nepal, India are all so so much better than this. Totally hate the experience! You see people fainting, hear kids wailing. And I have to add, the immigration officers were lazing around, instead of opening more counters or managing the crowd, they just walked up and down, chatting, laughing instead of doing anything. I will never ever fly into this airport again! Totally inhumane place! Utter disgrace for Thailand!",1.0
47,"Thailand's immigration processes have never been fantastic. When the budget carriers were still running our of Suvarnabhumi, it was nothing short of mayhem, but then they reopened Bangkok Don Muang and moved the budget carriers there. At that time, provided you were not checking luggage, DMK was actually a much much quicker routine. You'd use the self service machines to check in, then just waltz on through with usually nobody in the immigration line. It suited me nicely as I was flying about once a week through Bangkok regionally. Then the flood started. Air Asia and other operators started flying jam packed flights out of China and ramped the number up quickly. It slowed things down massively. Around that time, I pulled my finger out and got myself an APEC frequent business traveler card and thus could waft through Suvarnabhumi's lines with minimal wait, so I largely gave up on Air Asia and DMK. Just last week I needed to bring the whole family and a nanny to Bangkok at short notice and I just thought I'd save a few dollars by flying Air Asia. I thought to myself, what is an extra 30 minutes line time vs $350 or so all up? How wrong I was. As expected, upon landing there were three other flights inbound from Chinese cities, all jammed full and there had obviously been no coordination between Airport ops and Immigration. When I saw this, I thought to myself, ""well, I have an APEC card, so I'll bend the rules a little and take the family through the Priority Lane"". Uh uh, no way. The entry to that lane, now has three different, ambiguous banners that basically allow anyone who is not a single male, into the line. There is some vague banner about it being acceptable for single women travelers to use this lane. Thus there were about 8 single, young ladies furiously pumping out WeChat messages with selfies to show how bad their wait was. There were no staff to help organize the lines which is always a massive fail by the airport. It took us a little over an hour to clear this stage and we could see from the regular lines, that people were waiting much longer. I would estimate up to 3 hours, but it's hard to say for sure. I believe that Thailand still has an Open Skies Policy. They talked about trying to end it in 2015, but I guess the airlines put the moz on that. Seriously, if Bangkok expects to be taken seriously as a hub, it cannot continue to operate like this. I've recently been through those old favorites of Changi, Hong Kong and even KL and they are all much better this ridiculous attempt at airport management.",3.0
48,"Arriving in Don Muang from Changi Airport, Singapore, at around 13.45 on Friday afternoon it was a scene of utter chaos and took two hours to reach the immigration desk. Having read other stories for Saturday arrivals the authorities blamed it on many planes arriving at the same time. This seems to have happened on many occasions as the same happened to a colleague of mine arriving around midnight on Saturday, another two hour scenario and in reality it now seems the norm. So too many planes are arriving at the same time constantly! Absolutely crazy! Will never use Don Muang again, no organisation whatsoever and a terrible 'first impression' for those arriving for their dream holiday here.",1.0
49,Unlike many of the other reviewers I arrived into the airport mid afternoon. My flight ironically arrived early but the chaos I observed in immigration was like nothing I had ever seen before at any airport around the world and I have travelled a lot. The hall was completely packed with passengers desperately trying to clear immigration. There was no clearly demarcated lines and no airport staff on the passenger side of the immigration desks to organize the passengers. On top of that the air con was not working and the conditions therefore hot and humid. With no organized queues many lines were not moving as too many people filtering into 1 desk. It took me nearly 3 hrs to clear immigration and that was after 1 desk opening near to me after 2 hours. Otherwise I really don't know how long it would have taken. This is clearly unacceptable. What about those families traveling with small children or elderly. Thai airport authorities need to do something about this quickly and airlines like Air Asia need to put pressure on them to do so. I won't be using this airport again in the near future and I would recommend all to avoid it until this is corrected.,1.0
50,"On 7th July, I waited for more than 3 hours with my 8 year old daughter for immigration. The worst service I have ever had. There were two counters for priority and a pregnant lady was denied to use the counter and another passenger who had to catch a flight at Suvarnabumi was also denied access for priority Lane. Very, very poor service and inhuman approach.",3.0
51,Immigration at this airport has become a disgrace. Last night we got to the terminal at 12.20am and it was after 3am before my passport was stamped after a thoroughly disorganised scrum of what felt like thousands of people but rationally I don't think it could be literally thousands. The arrivals hall was packed though and there's no queueing system for the immigration booths. I've arrived at this airport on a Friday night on Air Asia for many years originally from KL and now from HK. It was never like this late evening. Then last time in June it was quite bad with about an hour wait. Last night it was nearly three hours. Air Asia has taken to parking up at the end of the runway and using buses to get to the terminal which doesn't help but the immigration queue is worse. I took a picture of the arrival screen. Mostly AA flights. KL at 10pm and SG at 10.05pm and then nothing until 11.20pm with three flights before midnight and two between midnight and 1am. Even accounting for late arrivals nothing explains the bedlam and delays at immigration. Seems my experience is not isolated. Proper queueing system like at BKK and a full set of counter at peak times like Friday night. It's clear this problem has escalated out of control at this airport now. After expecting to be in Silom by midnight I eventually got to bed at 4am. Nothing is worth this experience Air Asia. Not schedule. Not price. You will lose your international business if you cannot do basic management of your airport partners and you will deserve it.,1.0
52,"Terrible long immigration queues, waiting for 3 hours, there are no proper lanes, very poor air-conditioning, there are hardly any places to sit and no shops to buy refreshments. Also many families with small kids have to wait all the time. Avoid coming late in the evening.",1.0
53,"Disorganized, poor management and very long queue of 3 hours at immigration counter at arrival hall in Bangkok Don Muang airport. No clear parition of lanes, a lot of tourist especially those came later have to cut the queues. A lot of frustation of waiting for 3 hours. Airport staff doing nothing to solve the problem or lessen the queueing time. Definitely not going to visit again.",1.0
54,"This airport has one of the best locations, with a shuttle bus from the airport to Bangkok City which only takes around 20 mins and nothing more. Arrival: upon my arrival, there was a very long queue at the passport control and without queuing control, it was a mess and many people didn't know which line to queue up in. It took me around 1 hour to get past this passport area. Departure: it was absolute nightmare, it was all about testing my patience of queuing up. My flight was at 5.20pm to Hong Kong and I arrived at the airport at 1.30pm. Firstly, I queue up at the VAT refund office to get my refund forms stamped, that took me 20 mins. Then, there was baggage check with another long queue. This baggage check took 30 mins, and then queuing up for 1 hour for the check in counter. After getting into the restricted area, we needed to queue up for around 30mins for the passport control, again. Now the last bit of queuing up was at the VAT refund counter, that took me a good 30mins. An important recommendation to all travellers who are departing from this airport: they recommended we arrived at the airport 3hrs before flight time, but I'd say to be on the safe side, allow yourself 4hrs.",2.0
55,"My first time arriving into Bangkok Don Muang took me 1 hour to queue through immigration. Last night it took me 2 hours. It would have taken me longer if a staff member was not yelled at by a Chinese tourist after complaining about the wait time. She then opened up another counter. I'm not sure if it's because I landed late in the evening at 11.15 pm, but they really need to do something to fix the lack of organisation. You realise all two lines merge into one when you finally wait one hour and you see the counter a few yards away. This is a major part of the problem, no one foresees this when you pick a queue upon landing with hundreds of people already waiting. Tons of people arrive in the evening yet they are understaffed. The queue for visa on arrival literally processed hundreds of tourists at a much quicker rate than the rest of us 'foreign' tourists. There was also no clear Asean line either for regional visitors. This really makes Bangkok look bad upon arrival. They need to learn how to process people quickly and efficiently just like its other airport, Suvarnabhumi. Right now this is the worst immigration wait time I've experienced in the world, and I do a lot of travelling. The airport is dim too, which does not offer a warm welcome during a two hour wait.",2.0
56,"I flew out of DMK on 9 June and flew into DMK on 18 June. Both flights were in the evenings. The immigration queue leaving BKK had around 35-40 people. The queues arriving into BKK were much longer and had many tour groups. The tour leaders somewhat kept things under control but it was clear some tour members were confused at which queues are applicable to them. There are dedicated queues for nationals from ASEAN countries but do not seem like these were properly enforced. There was also a queue for Priority/Diplomatic but while there were people some 5-6 people in the queue, the rope railing behind them was up and sealed the lane which created confusion for those wishing to join this lane. Resources seem limited and the officials worked hard to clear the crowds. In the departure area, there are several food options including MacDonald's, Subway, Fuji and Starbucks.",4.0
57,"I fly Air Asia regularly from Nakhon Phanom to Bangkok Don Muang and will be flying again on April 12 returning April 16 with my wife. During the past 6 months I have travelled, they are now using the congested gates 72 to 76 which require bus transportation to the aircraft. Similarly arrival times are now much longer because of the useage of bus transportation. What was the point of the terminal upgrade only to go back to the era a decade ago using buses. Why are we being forced to use outdated and out moded boarding and arrival facilities when there are ample boarding lounges with air bridges?",2.0
58,The catering facilities are poor at this airport to say it is an international airport. There are hardly any tables for McDonald's and Subway so the whole area is chaotic. Needs upgrading urgently. When you get your food (which takes forever) don't even think of finding a table.,3.0
59,Don Muang (DMK) is the older and smaller airport in Bangkok compared to Suvarnabhumi. It is closer to the city centre and is mainly used for domestic flights and regional flights on low cost carriers. The clear advantage is the shorter trek between security clearance and the boarding gates. The security clearance at DMK for departures were conducted quickly and I was in the transit area within 30mins of arriving at the airport. The security clearance while exiting Bangkok seems to be a lot quicker in DMK compared to Survarnabhumi and less stressful. I am enrolled in the Priority Pass programme but there is no lounges in DMK's international terminal. I understand there are lounges in the domestic terminal of DMK. There are restaurants in the passenger area including Macdonald's and Subway.,7.0
60,"Arrived at Bangkok Don Muang at 12.30 and didn't get through immigration until 3. Priority lane used by anybody, ASEAN lane also clearly used by non-ASEAN citizens. Long lines because of many arriving flights (no issues with this), but the problem was, nowhere near enough staff at immigration desks. The biggest problem of all were the hundreds of mainland Chinese, all pushing and cutting the queue, and Thai staff doing absolutely nothing about any of this. No shops to buy water. All up, abysmal. Trust me, it's worth paying a little extra to go the the main BKK airport. I personally found signage fine, but several times large groups of Chinese tourists left the queue because none of them had completed their visa on arrival procedure, which tells me the signage needs improvement too.",1.0
61,"It functions as an airport, that's clear. I've used terminal 1 and 2, and must say that terminal 2 is better in terms of preference. Every arrival, it's 25 minutes from runway to car, if it's a gate, not a remote stand. Staff there are cold, (with AirAsia staff as an exception) but they are able to answer every question. The arrivals is dreadful, it has no natural daylight whatsoever at the concourse, (Terminal 1) but at least it does have window views at the main part of the terminal. However, I'd rather have a flight land at Suvarnabhumi. The only thing here better than Suvarnabhumi is the baggage delivery speed. Food is overpriced as expected, and there are a lot of cleaners around who do their job. Shops here are only duty free and a one or two souvenir shops.",7.0
62,"Solid airport with Amari Don Muang Airport Hotel connected via sky bridge. Very convenient to access and very comfortable and clean. Airport staff are also very helpful with directions and advice. Airport facilities are more than adequate with food and beverages, as well as other necessary for air travel stalls for last minute purchase. Counters are spacious and long queues often made to look not as long cos the counters are wide and long.",9.0
63,"Though Don Muang is not the main airport of Bangkok, it is still very user-friendly. One might have problems with at check in but I don't believe this is the airport's fault. Very much a clean airport. Shops and restaurants are more than enough, but none of the restaurants are serving halal food. Aside from this, a good airport to travel in.",8.0
64,"The airport (terminal 2) itself is very modern and simple enough to get about. Check in desks are dedicated to airlines which makes check-in earlier from my opinion. Bring warm clothes as Air Con will be on and make it feel quite cold. Security was efficient and finding your gate is easy. Getting Wifi is complicated as you have 20 or so wifi options to connect to and no idea which is genuine. Airport should make this clearer with signage or leaflets. My main complaint is that the Terminal 2 Airport has a tourist information desk. They offer information but are very quick to sell tours to you. We booked a Golden Triangle Tour with them as we were going to Chiang Mai. Thankfully we didn't book anything else. We booked with them thinking that as they are located within the Airport that they would be reputable and genuine. They stated that their tours were ""half the price of what you would pay in Chiang Mai"" and that ""their price is fully inclusive with no surprise/extra fees"". This turned out to be a total lie and their cost were in fact twice what we got quoted by at least 4 different agencies in Chiang Mai. My advice, book when you get to CM and avoid this tourist information desk which is straight after security at terminal 2 departures. Hopefully the Airport will see this and clamp down on their lies.",7.0
65,"Don Muang has always been more comfortable than the new sibling Suvarnabhumi. Transportation will be better as soon as the skytrain is complete so till then taxis or bus from the skytrains terminus. The departure terminal can be crowded but manageable. The problem is with passport control and if you're unlucky enough to fly alongside the numerous chinese flights causing really long lines at immigration with unruly passengers pushing in. Once you pass the passport control then a painless security check and then some shops here and there with restaurants. The ground floor gate area is incredibly uncomfortable and overcrowded (airline hauling passengers by bus and not sky bridge) so avoid it till your boarding time. A bit more cleanliness is needed, the interior looks shabby and needs a scrub.",6.0
66,"I arrived at Bangkok Don Muang 15:15 hrs from Bali along with hundreds of other passengers from various flights. The room at immigration was so crowded and it was difficult to know where to queue. There are officials in uniform walking about but not guiding nor helping anybody to queue. I queued for just over 2 hours before being seen. People were getting hot and tired and there was no drinking water or shop available. The priority queue was being abused by people who were not pregnant or elderly. I was told by passengers that anybody can walk through that gate unchallenged which they did. I was told by the air stewardess on my Air Asia flight that I did not need to fill in an arrivals slip as I had a connecting flight to UK. At the immigration counter, the woman was very rude and abrupt as I did not have the immigration card filled in. I explained that I had a connecting flight to UK. She shouted at me very rudely telling me to to back and complete the form, which I did. I went downstairs to find my luggage. The signs for the belt number had disappeared as I had been waiting so long. After asking several staff where the bags from my flight were, I found my bag, the very last one, just left abandoned by the side. The waiting times, organisation, lack of assistance and inadequate number of officials is unacceptable at this airport. It is down to poor management, inadequacy and contempt for travellers. Suvarnabhumi Airport is the opposite and very well-managed. Perhaps staff at Don Muang could take some training on customer relations. I have travelled much of the world and this was the worst experience ever.",1.0
67,"My recent experience in departing Bangkok Don Muang was a very negative one. I arrived in plenty of time for my flight to Surabaya and checked in then headed straight for immigration. When I got there queues were so long that they spilled outside the snake queuing barriers. Various officials were around and doing nothing to help manage the queues. What I also disliked was the fact that families with children aged around 8 to 10 years old and no infants were directed to the ""priority"" lane which is typically reserved for disabled people, passengers with imminent departures who haven't got the time to queue or families with infants who cannot be reasonably expected to wait in line for any length of time. While these long queues could be partly blamed on the fact there were many passengers, the number of immigration counters was woefully inadequate for an airport of this size. In the departures lounge once through security, shops and dining options are decent and plentiful, although not quite up to the standard of Suvarnabhumi, the main airport of Bangkok. Nevertheless it is hard to complain about this aspect. However overall I will do everything I can in future to fly into Thailand via Suvarnabhumi rather than the shambles of an airport that is Don Mueang.",2.0
68,"Arrived by taxi which was easy and hassle free. The entrance area was small and packed with tourists. Flew with Scoot to Singapore, queue was extremely long (do not know if this has to do with the airline or airport). Before clearing the immigration, limited shops/restaurants. However, after security and immigration check lot of shops (both local and international brands) and many eateries. Clean airport, signs are clear and very convenient. Gate was changed but was informed clearly through annoucement.",8.0

Bring an empty plastic water bottle as water fountains are equiped so you can easily refill bottles, once you are past security which is reasonably quick. There is also a 7-11 out by the smoking area. Vending machines are poor and it's very plain inside, but pretty clean and functional. Good airport, with many transport options.",7.0
70,"I had a connecting flight here coming from Yangon, Myanmar going to Jakarta, Indonesia. I am shocked that at an airport in a major city like Bangkok, it is even a possibility that someone with a connecting international flight would be unable to purchase food in the international departure area. I tried to exchange my Myanmar Khyats for Thai Bhat, they wouldn't take Khyats. So I asked for the ATM machine, they don't have any in this section of the airport. On top of that, if you want to go to the ATM machines, you need to leave the international departure area. None of the restaurants take cards. I'm shocked at the level of incompetence at this airport. It's ridiculous that someone making a transit here could go for hours unable to get food. Luckily a kind airline worker bought me a sandwich. I really hope an airport official reads this and makes the necessary changes because the situation here is unacceptable.",2.0
71,"Basic but cozy airport that is closer to Bangkok city than the main BKK used by major international airlines. Don Muang is mainly used by low-cost airlines and I found it more convenient if your destination is central Bangkok. Facilities there are basic but you will find all the essentials.

72,"This review concerns Terminal 2, open in December 2015, for domestic flights. Last time I flew through Don Muang was before the completion of Suvarnabhumi Airport and it is difficult to recognize the buildings which went through major upgrade. Departure hall is spacious and brightly lit with enough space to avoid the crowd feeling you experience at Suvarnabhumi. Plenty of food outlets reasonably priced (for an airport) on the mezzanine level. Security check fast but thorough. Departure gates so far did not undergo any major upgrade and walking distance can be long. Arrival hall spcious and bright: luggage delivery reasonbly fast. Although some effort has been made to control taxi services to city, the official taxi stand is difficult to find and you will be subjected to many touts before you reach it.",8.0

Took 1 hour and 40 minutes to get visa on arrival (the queue was for a mere 9 people, also no Fast option) then immigration took another 1hour 20 minutes. It's not that it's a busy airport, it's just insanely inefficient. Thank goodness we didn't have luggage to collect.",1.0
74,"Very early morning departure. Immigration quick, and distances in airport limited. At international side no 7/11 or similar supermarket, and very early morning limited number of places for food and drinks (+ not clear when they open). Luggage also arrived quick enough on way back, and sufficient coffee places around the gates. Except for the fact that it appears hardly any maintenance has been done for years, the only other complaint is transport. Taxi lines can be enormous and bus options at the airport quite expensive - but I traveled by rental car and it worked great to get to town.",7.0
75,"I departed to Cambodia through Don Mueang on December 31 - so the date might have made a difference to my experience. 7:10 flight departure, arrived at the airport about 4:20 am. Check-in hall was completely packed with people waiting to check in and lines were moving very slowly. I estimate it might have taken  3 hours to see a check in agent. Found the bag-drop line which was much shorter and checked in online using a smartphone while waiting our turn. Still took about an hour to get through the lineup though. Getting through immigration and customs on the return flight 4 days later was very fast - maybe waited for 3 or 4 people.",4.0
76,"The airport has been completely renovated and the result is stunning. Check-in for domestic flights is now smoother, as there is plenty of space. What is still terrible is the availability of taxis for the arrivals, queues are huge, there are not enough taxis, not enough spaces for taxis to take passengers and the system is very slow, as the drivers have to go to the counter to pick passengers, unlike Suvarnabhumi, where they just pick a number when entering the taxi area.",7.0
77,"The WiFi is so difficult to access. Travellers appreciate simplicity, not having to jump through hoops and never getting access. There are endless questions and at the end of the day it becomes apparent they want you to buy it. Plus there are no charging stations. This is not world class.",4.0
78,"I flew from here to KL and then back here from Krabi around new year. Flying out was not so bad: the Premium Flex counter for AirAsia passengers is hidden away, so I didn't notice it until I was halfway through the ordinary queue. But flying into Don Muang for the first time I made a rookie mistake - I stood and waited in the taxi queue, which snakes out of sight, around corners, and ultimately took me an hour. The delay seems to be waiting for enough taxi drivers and writing destinations down on tickets. This needs to be fixed, badly.",5.0

Only one line of traffic can enter the airport at a time and the line of taxis snakes for miles.",4.0
81,Don Muang is Bangkok's older airport. Cabs still overcharge here but it's super easy to take the bus outside the main doors to the subway terminal then take the subway. Two cabs refused to use the meter at the airport preferring to quote a price that was 3 or 4 times the meter. I was quoted 1500 baht (the trip to the airport was 390 baht) and ended up taking the subway for 120 total. It took 15 minutes longer but I ended up 3 blocks from my hotel. I travel light so it was great. On a recent trip to Vietnam my visa was refused. I had to get a new kind of visa online. Getting through the requirements was impossible - having failed already I had no clue what to do. Several employees at Don Muang helped me find people to ask for help until I finally found an immigration supervisor from Vietnam who walked me through the process even taking me to the airline supervisor to get my change of flight fees waived. She was very patient and helpful and I wouldn't have been able to see Vietnam had she not helped me.,7.0
82,"Just like some other people I, too, prefer Don Muang to Suvarnbhumi, the latter being overwhelmed in two respects: immigration lines which seem endless and baggage arrival which can easily take up to 30 minutes. Don Muang, by contrast, is a breeze. Yes, Suvarnbhumi is glitzy in comparison, yes, Suvarnbhumi has lots and lots of shops. But I am neither a shopper or someone interested in glitz (as opposed to glamour). Give me efficiency and ease of use and Don Muang wins hands down.",8.0
83,"I was a frequent user of Don Muang in the days when it was Bangkok's main gateway. Although it had reached the limit of development, it still managed to be user friendly. I was therefore, pleased to see it re-open a year or so ago, to handle budget carriers and domestic traffic. A hallmark of the old DMK was its range of services, some tucked away that made for interesting explorations and constant discovery of new outlets. The ""new"" DMK doesn't have very many facilities as yet, but they are coming slowly. As soon as the old DMK closed, they raised the toll on the elevated highway from TB20 to TB60 (now TB70), meaning the tolls to get to DMK from the town centre are a total of TB120, as opposed to TB75 to Suvarnabhumi. So the lower cab fare/shorter distance is offset by the higher toll. The big plus point is the ease of getting through the airport, compared to Suvarnabhumi. Typically, you can clear customs and immigration in 10 minutes or so, compared with 30-40 minutes in Suvarnabhumi. Coupled with the fact that none of the gates are very far to walk makes it my favourite of the two airports.",9.0
84,"It might be old and look run down, but it functions greatly. I had an international departure to Denpasar. In contrast to the overly crowded Suvarnabhumi, where I flew in earlier the same day, there were no queues at either security and immigration at Don Muang. It was a breeze. I had a meal landside at the foodcourt on +1, which was fine and affordable. The toilets in the international departure gate must have been refurbished recently, they were modern, clean and well kept. The free shuttle bus between Suvarnabhumi and Don Muang is very convenient, although don't plan too tightly, Bangkok traffic is bad.",8.0
85,"Domestic Section was undergoing some construction on my departure date. Air conditioning system in departure hall is not working and entire hall is uncomfortably warm. Going to the airport on Friday evening is a difficult task due to traffic, otherwise this airport is user friendly.

Sign is clear and there are too few walkways to get lost. Still love this little old charming airport.",8.0
86,In Departures bit of a messy check-in on Air Asia disorganised queuing plenty queue jumping going on and nobody doing anything about it. Immigration was pretty quick and airside has plenty shopping and eating options though like BKK not especially cheap. Arrivals was a bit of a hike to Immigration but reasonable queue time and not much waiting for luggage. Taxi queuing times were probably the worst part of the experience (30 mins in mid afternoon) but maybe I just hit a bad time.,5.0
87,Yes it's a bit tatty and some of the signs are slightly confusing. There are a good selection of shops and cafes although the restaurant selection is much worse than the new BKK.,6.0
88,We travelled through Don Muang several times in September both domestic and international. Check in at Air Asia can be hectic early morning but airport staff open up additional check in kiosks immigration took an average 5 minutes so long as you had filled in and signed your departure slip. Baggage pick up again very efficient within 5 minutes of arriving at the carrousel the flights bags were arriving. Plenty of fast food outlets coffee shops duty free seating at the gate is adequate public announcements in English there are smoking rooms after immigration for those with a craving. Taxis have a 50Baht extra charge but you have a guarantee that the meter will be used  trains station is close by and a bus at 35 baht will take you to the nearest MRT. Its an older airport which shows in certain areas but not the worst in the world.,8.0
89,While the airport was clean and staff friendly and ease through to gate simple there were no indoor smoking area at all. I had to go all the way back through the check-ins to nearest smoking are outside where there were no facilities food drink or airport information. This is a great shame that the air port treat it's customer with such contempt. The main airport although poor does have handy smoke rooms to stop. If you really care about customer service you to think about all your customers.,
90,Using the airport for domestic travel I found it to be excellent. Check-in at Air Asia was done within 5 minutes no queues at security and unusually for an airport a very good selection of eateries and shops airside with non- inflated prices. There's even a 7-11 selling the usual fair for those wanting a cheap snack or drink. The only downside was the bussing in on the return flight from Phuket despite a lot of free airbridges and a subsequent wait of 20 minutes for the bags to arrive.,10.0
91,It was like visiting an old friend again! The check-in area was a little tatty and run down but once through immigration it opened up to plenty of space good seating and runway views. Sufficient choice of restaurants and services and very quiet compared to BKK. Very little queue time and small distances to travel compared to a far gate at BKK. Well recommended for ease of access and ease of usage.,8.0
92,Huge airport not a lot of flights its a joy to use. Only downside was bussed to the plane on departure found that odd with so many empty stands with jetways. Flew out to Singapore with TAA and back in from Phuket with TAA. No lines for check in passport control or security. Lots of seating both air and land side. Good selection of shops and places to eat on international departures. All in all I look forward to the next time I can use this airport.,9.0
93,Had to fly into DMK with Thai Air Asia. This was like visiting an old friend. In the old days DMK always functioned well unlike its new big brother. Now its even better. The domestic area had plenty of fast food eating options at prices better than BKK. Plenty of seating in gate area. Really pleased with what they have done in refurbishing DMK. Now bus connection to Mo Chit BTS station and also shuttles to BKK airport.,10.0
94,Found recent comments on Don Muang very interesting. Used this airport many times in the past when I lived in Bangkok and this was the only airport in town. Back then late night departures were unpleasant. At least a dozen 747s left between 11pm and 1 am. The departure area was packed to capacity. Some staff were stressed to the limit and consequently foul tempered. Immigration staff were rude too!! The airport was a shame. All that seems to have changed for the better. The airport went through an expansion plan in the 80s and grew to be a thoroughly modern airport. Still it couldn't keep pace with traffic growth and overcrowding persisted. The international departures area was great. Great food superb view of the tarmac excellent shopping. Don Muang to its credit never slipped. Just about every airline flew to BKK. I will fly to Suvarnabhumi and will probably never get to see Don Muang again.,8.0
95,Good to see this airport back in operation. Security was quick and efficient. Check-in on Air Asia was a matter of a few minutes. Plenty shops and eating places both landside and airside. Obviously the airport is huge for the volume of passengers going though it. The worst parts were the somewhat lengthy walks to and from gates and the lengthy and poorly organised Taxi queues which were always a problem with this airport before. Overall a good move for the budget carriers who are using Don Muang and a good service for the passengers.,8.0
96,Used DMK twice and was impressed. DMK is light and spacious and has room for growth. Toilets are clean throughout and several food options exist. It's a standard 300 baht or so to get there from the centre of Bangkok. Hopefully ground transport options from DMK to other parts of Thailand will grow. Otherwise we really liked this place.,9.0
97,A 350 baht taxi ride from Suvarnabhumi but found the free shuttle bus for the return trip. Check in immigration etc was well organised. Airside was clean and fresh. Plenty of seating and not too many shops. Nice airport.,8.0
98,I use Don Muang whenever possible although Thai keeps playing with their timetable. The central air terminal at lat phrao station is a real plus as nobody uses it! A sign in the subway telling you which exit to take would be useful! The downside is the baggage check on the Bangkok subway. They insist on opening your suitcase but never actually rummage around inside. Check-in at the terminal is swift and Thai staff take care of the bags once you arrive at Don Muang as its already tagged and security sealed on check-in at the terminal. You can now eat airside. Burger king has returned to the departure area. Its either that or get a gold card and use THAI business lounge. If Bangkok is your destination then Don Muang is streaks ahead of the new airport,4.0
99,The best thing of the reopened domestic airport Don Mueang (DMK) is the vicinity to the city of Bangkok. An improved service was provided by THAI at its City Air Terminal at the Metro Station “Lad Phrao” with check-in facility including free shuttle bus to and from the airport. Besides these nothing was changed! It remains an old small nice domestic terminal. Arrive there check-in go through security check wait just a few minutes at the gate and then take off! On the way back after docking at the gate walk down to the luggage area always only after few minutes you will have your luggage and then ready for Bangkok. Frankly regarding to the departure and arrival procedures the airport fulfils its function hence a five-star-airport.,5.0
100,Used Don Muang twice since its reopening for domestic routes. Couldn't detect any signs of change or improvement over recent years. It's basically just the old domestic terminal with the same ensemble of 2-3 food outlets and a souvenir shop it always had. Check in procedure as usual with the good old x-ray machine for the bigger luggage in front of the check-in area. After security check there's nothing but rows and rows of chairs and a toilet. Transfer from Suvarnabumi is chaotic and can take hours depending on time of day and traffic situation. All in all a place that should have better remained closed once and for all.,2.0
101,Flew from Don Muang to Phuket in mid April very uninviting and old airport if they are going to be using this airport for long term domestic operations then it needs a facelift. Also note there are absolutely no shops whatsoever after the security check just the gates and toilets.,1.0
102,"One of the best kept secrets about BKK Don Muang is the inexpensive food court at the far end of Terminal 2. Start one level up from the lowest arrivals level. Go as far as you can to the southern end of Terminal 2 in the general direction of the Domestic Terminal. Walk past the bookstore on the right and around the 7-11. At the start of the long elevated ""tube"" that leads to the Domestic Terminal you'll see it on the right. It's clearly signed. If you find yourself looking at parked cars instead of the ""tube"" you are in the right spot but on the wrong level. The place is used mostly by Thai airport workers plus a few savvy travelers. It serves a wide range of Thai food so some (though not all) of the food is spice. It uses a coupon system in increments of 5 baht. Buy coupons before you choose your food drink etc. You can eat very well for 30-35 baht. And it really is delicious. A wonderful place if you just arrived and you need a meal before heading for town or if you are catching a no-frills flight that doesn't serve food. I hope they are planning something similar at the new airport.",
103,I agree with Derek Moore regarding the Taxi situtation on the departure level. Me as a fluent Thai speaker and resident who flies into BKK every week I do take the Taxi's on the upper level but must make it clear to them where I want to go and make sure they operate the meter correctly (I know the fare home so they cannot play tricks on me). However I would strongly discourage people who do not know BKK and who do not speak Thai to take a cab there especially not at night and its needless to say that women should avoid this at all costs. As a matter of fact most crimes against foreigners in Thailand are committed during the Taxi rides to and from the airport.,
104,Reading some of these reviews on Bangkok airport I would like to say that the Taxi booth at arrivals is spot on all very safe and cheap too pay your Baht 300 in my case and thats it. Bad points very few lifts in T1 T2 and when you do find one watch the doors they stay open for about 3 seconds before trying to crush you which you may then find yourself going up and down floors without even getting out. No need to shop around in all the different duty free stores as the airport operates a one price system and other than cigarettes and sprits prices are more expensive than UK duty free. If you fancy a spot out of the way drinks food etc try the little bar upstairs near Burger king they have a outside area too nice at 6am a bit warm at 3pm just be careful about leaving un-checked baggage outside as its not visible.,
105,People recently recommending that it pays to go to departures to pick up a taxi are missing the point. The 'official' taxi desks outside T's 1 & 2 incur a surcharge of thb50 which is less than £1 sterling just over $1 US. The fare downtown on the meter will then be less than a further thb200 or so. Work it out ! Compare that with LHR CDG JFK or the like ! The desk staff record the taxi number and destination so this acts as a security check and deterrent for the driver to not try any tricks. The drivers dropping off upstairs are unregulated and are more likely to refuse to operate the meter and/or to try any of the well known scams some of these guys get up to. Every year people are robbed or worse by airport taxi drivers and whilst I do not imagine that any statistics exist to prove my point my bet is that it will be the unregulated ones who are doing the majority of the offending. The departures option is probably okay for regulars who know where they are going and who can speak a little of the language or for two or more men travelling together but I would not recommend inexperienced visitors especially singles - and certainly not single women - to go this route.,
106,I've also used Don Muang airport several times. Although it's not as pleasant as some other newly opened international airports around the world but I found it fairly convenient. For the airport tax I think most people misunderstand the way it works. If my understanding is correct the Bkk airport tax is not included in the ticket price as other airports do. Which means if you make a connection flight within the airport and don't pass through the immigration you are not paying airport tax at all. Therefore most people feel like they have to pay as much as THB500 upon passing the departure immigration check. I suggest you all ask for the breakdown of taxes upon the purchase of your air ticket instead of getting frustrated with this kind of arrangement. I'm sure that many other airports also work this way.,
107,Travel tip for BKK. Don't wait for a taxi with all the other arriving passengers just walk (or get lift) up to departures (1 floor directly above) and hail a taxi that has dropped off departing passengers. It will save time and you won't get hassled by touts while you are waiting. Also I have found that they will treat you like a local and go off the meter (negotiated fares are almost always more than the meter).,
108,Bangkok airport has been improved for the past few years. However because of the layout of the terminal it is not a friendly airport for some transfer/transit passengers. I recently flew on a SQ flight from SIN to KIX with a stop at BKK with two small children. We had only 45 minutes stopover in BKK late at night but we were asked to get off the plane with all our belongings walk around 500m go up the stairs go throgh the security and walk 500m again to go back to the same gate (and the boarding has already started). I understand the importance of security but the airport should be a little more family friendly for example not closing the stairways closer to the gate in order to go upstairs for security. Other than that it is a quite good airport.,
109,Flown into and out of Bangkok Don Muang Airport a couple of times. It's fast and efficient with queing/waiting times for luggage/check in minimal in both directions. It's not to hot to look at but with it's age is expected. Landing and going through the international arrivals exits is a bit overwhelming with some very pushy people trying to push you into there taxis/tours or to other less scrupulous places but if you keep your head down and act as if you know where your going you can generally get through. One tip it's relatively tiny considering but the airport does make a small charge on top of the usual taxi fare for hiring a cab from the taxi rank at international arrivals so just go up one floor and pick one up from the hundreds that drop people off every minute at departures - just a couple of floors up in the lifts. Overall the airport is great if your running through it quickly but not so good if your hanging around for your flight. Airport hotel is ok but I prefer to stay at the Miracle grand (just 5mins down the expressway and much newer/nicer) or the Sofitel Central Plaza to do shopping at the same time.,
110,Flew in and out of T2 at BKK in the past week. Baggage retrieval and immigration was fast on arrival and we were out of there in no time. We found security checks on departure to be tighter and more in number than in other airports we departed from during our holiday (CNS SIN LHR AMS SYD) but we had no problems with this and all done by staff with a pleasant and efficient approach. A metered taxi between the airport and our hotel in Siam Square cost approx USD$8 an easy and inexpensive option. Yes the opening of the new airport later this year appears timely but for the present Don Muang has all the facilities retail and food outlets one expects to see at an international airport terminal. It serves its purpose. The Thai people are generally pleasant people to deal with and we found travelling in and out of BKK to be a relatively painless experience.,
111,Arrived Bangkok Don Muang Airport from Dubai with a connecting flight to Krabi and returned a few days later. Be warned that if you have just arrived on an international flight and need to connect up to a domestic one you are in for quite a walk. Terminal 1 has no aesthetics - tt does the basics of the job and that's it. The bizarre departure tax requirement was a bit surprising. I found the toilets to be exceptionally clean and shops are ok for souvenirs. Overall not a great airport but then again not amongst the worst either. Anja Lieder's remarks are in my opinion more accurate- especially pertaining to customer service and helpfulness.,
112,Flew out of T2 in the early hours of 5th November. Found it to be a pleasant experience and not too busy at that time of night. Clean & tidy. Didn't appreciate the over pushy duty free sales assistants. Is every shop King Power? Maybe the new airport will offer more duty free choice.,
113,It's all been said before but BKK needs a massive refit and the new airport can't come quick enough. The worst thing is the complete lack of seating if you can't get into an airline lounge. When the flights depart in the evening and very early morning the airport is crammed with people and you can't even sit down!,
