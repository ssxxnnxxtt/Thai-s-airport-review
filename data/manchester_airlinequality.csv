0,"Used the Airport for an early morning flight to Malta. In view of previous warnings and horror stories we got there hours before departure. The bag drop with EasyJet took about 10 minutes, and we were through security etc in another 15, so no complaints there. We managed to fill up our water bottles and do some duty free shopping. The Departure Lounge was busy, but there was no problem finding seats. Take off was on time. On the return journey a few days later, we were quickly through immigration (and the machines actually worked) and we only had to wait another 10 minutes for our bags to appear on the carousel. Overall a stress free experience, and hopefully this is now the norm for the future.",8.0
1,"After arriving on the Lisbon to Manchester TAP flight which landed at 17.20 on Friday 14th October, we were obliged to wait for 40 minutes on the plane because the certified person at the airport to link the airport bridge to the plane was missing! We then waited a further 40 minutes for our bags to arrive at the baggage delivery carrousel. The TAP crew kept us informed saying that they were constantly trying to connect to the airport authorities who simply ignored them. What an awful airport Manchester has become.",1.0
2,I have just been through Manchester Airport security and I have no words to describe what a shambles it is!! I have travelled extensively and through airports across the world and this is the worst experience in my life. I am totally at a loss on the level of incompetence and the only people responsible for this is the management team at this airport. Can someone please tell when Vaseline became a liquid!! This did not happen to me but to someone waiting for over 30 minutes in the queue.,1.0
3,"My july visit to this airport is an absolute joke. People jumping the ques at security and they didn't even do anything to stop them. The food in the place was £20 for a burger and chips, £5 for a pint, arrivals was not too bad. October visit was even worse dropping my disabled auntie off no marshals outside T2, no one to meet her either, had to go inside and abandon my car. Thinking free parking with a blue badge, well no, my auntie should of had the blue badge even though she is severely disabled and cant drive. This airport is an absolute joke of a place.",1.0
4,"Security is a disaster! OMG, What a huge mess their security line-up is. I have travelled all over the world and this place is a chaotic mess. The security setup is abysmal. It was so disorganized and such a mess, I almost missed my plane and they didn't care at all except for one lovely agent who saved my day",2.0
5,"Absolutely shambolic! This airport is a total waste of space. I have travelled quite a lot and have never experienced such a bad travel experience. This is not a new thing. I have never been happy traveling from this airport but it has now become such an awful experience that I would rather stay at home than travel via Manchester. There seems to be a strange culture amongst the limited staff of the customer being just an inconvenience or a nuisance, can't quite decide if this stems from, no training or, bad training but they show a complete lack of concern for the customers who pay their wages. I, like many other travellers, am always a little anxious when travelling but by the time I got through security with people bullying and shouting instructions at everyone I was a nervous wreck. I needed a stiff drink but that was just another stressful experience, 30 min wait and only one staff member I travelled from T2 and the only good thing I can say about the place is that I got plenty of walking exercises. Whoever designed the place should be sued along with the people who passed the design. A ten-minute walk to get to the toilet that had two dirty cubicles in it, fancy designed toilet roll dispenser that was thick with dust and not one dispenser worked, good job I carry tissues. An absolute joke of a place. Well, they won't be getting my hard-earned cash in future. Maybe a boycott from customers and airlines might prompt them to get their act together.",1.0
6,This was the worst experience of my travel experience. Terminal 2 miles away. No seating areas. The pick up point for taxis etc is a absolute shambles. Will not be travelling from there again.,3.0
7,"We used Manchester Terminal 2 for our 06.10 flight to Majorca last week. Self checking in of baggage was a little better than when we did it in March, then it was chaotic. Going through security wasn't too bad, in fairness it was pretty quick, and the staff were pleasant. Then came the toilets, very few were working, dirty, no toilet paper, no soap, and this is at 4.00am, do they ever get cleaned? All areas after duty free, the food court, the passageways and the departure gate areas, were dirty. That brings me to the departure/gate staff - rude with a couldn't care less attitude. We came back from Majorca yesterday and disembarked at terminal 2. The Skybridge was dirty and full of litter. The toilets, again those that were working, are disgusting, dirty, no toilet paper. Passageways were still dirty. However border control was excellent, quick and again pleasant staff. Baggage reclaim was an absolute joke, 2hrs 20mins waiting for the bags to be unloaded. We found out that the Swissport baggage handlers, ALL FIVE of them, had 5 planes to unload which had landed within 15 mins of each other, so they did a great job. However, the same thing happened in March, 6 months ago. Covid is no longer an excuse, staff shortage and training is no longer an excuse, blaming contracted out servicing companies is no longer an excuse. What was once a great international airport is being managed by poor, incompetent, so called ""managers"" If at all possible, I will never use Manchester airport again.",1.0
8,"Worst experience of my life. I am fit and healthy but my wife has difficulty walking great distances and the walk after check in to the gate was horrendous. Manchester Airport gave no regard for the public, just finances and their own ego. This huge terminal is designed to handle up to 25 million passengers a year in complete discomfort. The seating is insufficient, the rolling pathways don't work, the building work is nowhere near finished and its filthy. Get your act together, you are a disgrace to the airline industry.",1.0
9,Terminal 2 bag drop and security no problems. The problem was getting food and a drink. Had to queue 30 minutes to get served. When i went to get another drink had to queue again for another 30 minutes even though i was already at a table in the bar. Badly organised service having to wait an hour in total to get served.,5.0
10,"Woeful and depressing experience.  Had to fight with security for them to agree I was travelling Business Class. the wait at FastTrack Security was 35 minutes. they then insisted I unpack because I had a bag containing an Apple Watch and chargers - they only got to that point after they had emptied the entire contents of my backpack, right there at security - that cost another 40 mins. when I complained I was met with a glib response and a don't believe all the reviews sir answer - baffling. If you have any choice of airport - make it and choose not to use Manchester Airport - its a disaster.",1.0
11,"Entering the Airport complex was very straight forward, junction 5 of the M56 and you were there, but that's when the problems occurred. I was totally confused, and the direction signage were designed to confuse the visitor. Every wrong turn i made, in my effort to locate terminal 1, and its parking area, resulted in having to pay £15 or 3x £5 to open the three separate exit barriers. It is grossly unfair to charge someone every time they take a wrong turning, due to the poorly laid out direction signage. On entering Terminal 1, directional signage, for a total stranger was very poor, resulting in a visit lasting nearly an hour, due to the long queue in the Lufthansa check in. In all, the parking levy cost me close to £30, and I was only supposed to be dropping someone off quickly. Not a nice first time experience, and i really hope i do not have to go back any day soon.",3.0
12,"I needed wheelchair assistance. The staff at the assistance office were overwhelmed and stressed, I just made it to my plane after the guy pushing my chair had to literally argue with security staff to get me through, I'm sure the many of the hundreds of other people in the assistance lane did not make theirs. The baggage security staff were so rude shouting at travellers to get a move on and saying the disabled wheelchair users were holding everyone up. The moving walkways from the rail station are not working neither in the airport itself (I was told by my assistance staff that it was to save money £30,000 a year apparently.) I flew Man-Frankfurt-Bangkok return, only in Manchester did I have any problems. In fact my wheelchair did not turn up at all for the last 2 flights that I have arried in Manchester. BTW the toilets i used in Terminal One arrivals were disgusting dirty and smelly. Manchester Airport takes the joy out of travelling.",1.0
13,"Post covid can not continue to be used as an excuse for terrible service, security, customer service and facilities. The terminal is going backwards with most eateries closing at 6pm, the duty free area poorly stocked and staffed and the terminal is dirty with a lack of cleaning staff and the security poor - even the armed police look complacent. They should be ashamed. The staff on baggage security are rude and incompetent and generally the airport has gone backwards - come on CEO and management - get this sorted out - it is a disgrace. You can’t keep putting posters up stating bear with us while we recover - covid has been and the rest of the world has learned from it and used it to make things better !",1.0
14,"Checked in at İstanbul all the way through to Toronto via Manchester. Arrived in Manchester to see a person holding a piece of paper advising connecting passengers to collect their bags and re-check in.  Grimy old passageways and no fresh air. Queue to cross the border because reasons. Listen to people being questioned about entering the UK because obviously everyone is suspicious. Bag did not arrive at baggage claim because zero bags did. Asked baggage handling staff how long the wait would be, usually. Told “this airport is crap” with a smile (actually the only really straight info I got.) Ran to the other terminal to make check-in for the flight I already had a boarding pass for. Huge line for security. Told to repack my 100ml toiletries in a different clear plastic bag 1cm smaller than the one I had. This cost precious minutes. Questioned at length about the medication in its packaging I had in my backpack. More minutes. Not many left! Ran through poorly signposted passages through shopping, in a circle, until another sign pointed the other way to where the gate actually was. Sprinted the last few hundred meters to arrive 5 mins before gate closure to find a hubbub of angry people because…the flight was delayed. Mopped sweat out of my clothes in a grubby airless toilet. Got the flight. Spent the next week wearing the same clothes with the spare undies, t-shirt, and socks I thankfully had in my backpack. Swore never to go through Manchester again. Worst 2 hours of the whole year or more. Sorry, but the staff were either overwhelmed, or standing around looking at their phones. It was the single worst travel experience I have ever had.",1.0
15,"I agree with the many other reviewers that Manchester Airport is a disgraceful affront to the travelling public. Exorbitant parking charges, inadequate seating, poor security operation etc etc, Perhaps the biggest insult is the fact that they have turned off the moving walkways between the rail station and terminals 1 and 3. This is a huge inconvenience to elderly people and those who experience difficulty walking due to injury etc. Probably the worst airport on the planet.",1.0
16,Possibly the worst in the UK. Only used it as the flight times suited us. Lacks cleanliness and just seems old and ragged compared to others. Would choose others where possible.,4.0
17,"Seriously, you’ve got to see this place to believe it. We arrived 3 hours before our long haul flight. The first queue is in the carpark. We spent just under an hour waiting to get into building. The next queue is check in. You can tell the staff really don’t want to be there and there are signs everywhere about respect, zero tolerance for abuse, etc. Airport management probably hasn’t figured out that so many passengers are angry because every single aspect of the airport experience is botched. The security screening process is straight out of a bad comedy. My wife had her jacket trashed by one of the security guys who managed to get it caught in the roller conveyer. The scanner seems to detect liquids everywhere even when there aren’t any. A small nasal spray in my hand luggage caused an additional 30 minute wait. My wife had her bag completely unpacked with all her personal items tipped into a filthy tray for everyone to see. Two hours after arriving we cleared security. The terminal itself (T1). Looks like a relic from the 60’s. There’s not enough seating and the place really is knackered. So we went straight to the gate - which was a long hike, maybe because the air raft was an A380. There were no toilets or facilities of any kind in the gate area. There were not even enough seats so many passengers stood. I’ve never had an airport experience like this anywhere else. Sadly it looks like the place needs to be rebuilt and management needs to find careers they’re better suited to. I’ll try very hard to avoid travelling through this airport again.",1.0
18,"I have visited many airports, and many of them large and busy, such as New York airport, but without a doubt, this is the worst airport, from which I will never ever travel again. One experience has been more than enough to know all the absurd rules it has, especially in the security controls.  It is absurd that only one excessively small bag of liquids per person is allowed at the security checkpoint and they have even taken away my hair straightener. After warning the security guard 3 times to turn my suitcase upside down because he was going to open it in the wrong position, he opened it upside down and all my clothes fell on the floor. Imagine all your underwear on the floor while people walk around you. Oh, and let's not talk about the time it takes to check your bag at this airport or get through security. If you don't want to miss your flight, better come 6 hours earlier. I will never come back, this airport leaves a lot to be desired.",1.0
19,"Manchester Airport is the most confusing stressful airport I have ever been in. When I went to the UK from Brisbane airport I went through check in my bag went straight on the plane and picked it up at the other end no problems. In Manchester I waited in a line for around an hour and a half only to be told I need to go to another queue to get my bag x-rayed so I stood for around another hour waiting for this. When I went through the screen with my personal carry bag it went in a different queue and I had to wait another half hour, the problem was I had a tube of savlon cream in my bag and it was suppose to be in a zip lock bag (no where else in the world do they do this). So what should of been a leisurely coffee in the terminal was a stressful rush. Just the whole experience was a stressful experience with incompetent people running the place.",1.0
20,"This was our third time through Manchester this year. We had booked Fasttrack and were directed into the lane quickly. Walking down to the corner we were astonished at how long the queue was and how the main lines were completely empty. The reason soon became apparent, all customers, irrespective of their booking were being directed into Fasttrack! It took us just under two hours to clear security. Of 34 security areas in Terminal 1, only two were operating! It was a shambles. No one cared about any passenger needs, from those with flights due to depart to elderly passengers, who were clearly needing to sit to families whose children were desperate to go to the toilet. A family in front of us finally managed to attract a member of staff because their daughter was desperate and was told they could leave but would have to go to the back of the line! Dad went with their daughter and we all helped him get back to his family after, despite the staff. I mean, we had only gone a few centimetres when they got back. To add insult to injury when we could see the security area about eight staff were lounging about doing nothing but chat with one another. Eventually, more staff came and they went up to four lanes. They also kept saying over the PA that it was the fault of passengers being slow that was the sole cause of the delays! What utter drivel. We pay a great deal for the privilege of standing in these queues and using airports, it is part of your airline ticket cost. We also pay Airport Passenger Duty and massive amounts for parking our cars. It is surely time for a change and airports to be held to account. Chief Executives have received massive bonuses for laying off too many staff and failing to re-recruit them when demand increased. Add to all that the fact that automatic walkways between terminals are all non-functional the place is awful.",1.0
21,"This is by far the worst experience at an airport i’ve ever had. I have lived all over the United States, visited countless countries experiencing their airports - however this was a joke. Arriving 3hrs 45min early, narrowly making it to the gate with a 5 minute window after they had already begun boarding. I was in a check-in queue for over 1:30hours and a security line of 2hours 5minutes. I have never experienced such pathetic and incompetent staff members, along with such a disorganized system of movement. Security queues made us wait in check in lines, with a 1:20hour wait before we even saw anything regarding security, where we were made to queue once more for almost an hour. From there, they told me that they were no longer prioritizing flights, leaving many many people to realize how late they were going to be for the flights they were about to miss.",1.0
22,"Just picked my brother and his family up from Manchester Airport, Terminal 3. Expensive parking, poor directions and indifferent staff. Added to the fact that my brother's luggage has gone missing (2 Large bags) and everything delayed. I am a proud Mancunian who is thoroughly ashamed of this awful, money grabbing airport. Andy Burnham should hang his head, good talker! Waste of space. 10 out of 10 for Liverpool airport though, a pleasure to use, so why can't Manchester get it right? Avoid it if you can.",1.0

24,"I travelled from Manchester airport on 4 June and despite the huge queues all the security staff were friendly, polite and helpful. I compliment them for their professionalism. In the wake of all the bad publicity, the staff must be praised for their professional, friendly and efficient manner in which they facilitated the flow of passengers through security. From stepping through the airport doorway at 3.30 am and into the lounge took 40 mins. A big thank you to all. Yes, there are large numbers of people and insufficient staff, but let’s not pillory those trying to do the best they can, in the circumstances.",7.0
25,"I have travelled from Manchester airport today (3rd June) with Jet2 and must complement the airline and airport staff for their exemplary service. In the wake of all the bad publicity they have experienced over the past few days I feel they should be praised for their professional, friendly and efficient manner in which they facilitated the flow of passengers through check-in, security and on-board the flight. From stepping through the airport doorway and onto the departure lounge it took one hour. Our flight was delayed by 15 mins of the original scheduled time and we arrived at our destination 10 mins later than planned. Our passage through Malaga airport was smooth and efficient. A big well done and thank you to all.",10.0
26,"I was at the Manchester airport yesterday, I needed to wrap up 9 large boxes. The lady in terminal 1 wrapping shop was fantastic as well as the security and the Wizzair staff even helped with my customs issue. I thought I'd miss the flight but they all made sure all ran smoothly and I made it. Fantastic . Also the parking marshal I met whilst waiting for the boxes, so helpful, not just helping me but I watched how he went out of his way to help other.",10.0
27,"This place has not a single saving grace about it and is more geared to gouging money out of travellers at every opportunity than to giving customers any sort of good experience. Pay here, pay there, pay everywhere, bad staff who seem hopelessly undertrained, uncomfortable seating areas, poor overpriced franchises, and queues everywhere. A lot of it is owned by the local councils around Manchester who doubtless want their pound of flesh out of it but regardless this is one of if not the worst airport I ever travel through and I've done many. Hang your heads in shame.",1.0
28,An utter shambles. An embarrassment to the City of Manchester. How long before they get their staffing sorted and provide a decent service. Time for heads to roll in the senior management.,1.0
29,"We stayed locally so that we could be early for 11am. Aer Lingus MCO flight. I had booked special assistance for my wife. Arrival 6.55 - already checked in so went to assistance desk. Told to go and drop off luggage. Went to bag drop. Not available so joined check in queue. Others using bag drop (with help from agent), rejoined bag drop only to be told to go for bag tags away from there. Eventually went back to assistance. Told 2 hours until someone would be available to push wheelchair. Told me that I could do the pushing if I wished. Mentioned FastTrack to agent. Forget it and get in regular (very long) queue. Did so and eventually moved towards the barriers for security. Tannoy called people forward with earlier flights. Airport agent said people were going through whose flights were later and that he had no authority to stop them. No managers around apparently. We then entered a corridor for quite some time. Eventually we arrived at security and hand baggage check. This took some time and we were faced with going through an empty duty free area. Oh, I forgot - we were now at 11.40am. On leaving there, we could see the Aer Lingus aircraft on stand so I started to run - 77 years of age! We were going nicely and then - thank you MAN - my knee collapsed. We made it - me hobbling - to the final stretch where we were met by ground staff. Last two on plane. Left stand 11.54am. Almost 5 hours to get through! Do Airport Assist provide the service? - not in our case, of course. If so, Orlando Airport were 5 star. Listed as Airport Assist also. Absolutely no comparison- arriving or departing. Returning to MAN - wheelchair - I pushed my wife again! Two areas 1) Manchester Airport- reactive not proactive 2) Airport Assist - kind of them to provide a wheelchair and nothing else. I have always urged friends to travel through our ""local gateway to the world"", I couldn’t do that anymore. A disgrace and embarrassing for the North. 8.15 by now.",2.0
30,Flight delayed by 3 hours. No one at Manchester cares. Now missed my connection and stuck in Qatar airport for 24 hours. Thank you Manchester airport.,1.0
31,Absolutely disgusting place. I am ashamed to be a Manc. This place gives Manchester a bad name. Flight delayed and then sat on the plane because no ground staff to off load luggage from flight. The airport is employing kids who have no clue what’s going on. The pilot on our flight has just said that currently Manchester airport is the worst airport!! I will make sure that I look to use another airport in future. No food in the shops and the queues were just a joke.,1.0
32,"Other reviews say this airport is unfit for purpose. It is not. All the problems with the airport are the result of deliberate management decisions. This was a departure from Terminal 2 on Qatar Airways to Doha. It was in late April, not during school holidays or at any other peak time. The queue for security was appalling. I travel a lot in Asia, Australasia and Europe, and I've never seen queues like this. You can pay an extra fee for ""fast track"", which brings queues down to a level similar to what one would expect in a normal airport. The airport's management has chosen to deliberately slow the main security queue in order to force people to pay the ""fast track"" fee. This policy is obviously deliberate. There was a queue snaking through the check-in hall, just to get into the security queue. There were well over 1000 people in the queue in the check-in hall when I was there, yet when we finally got into the security hall, less than half of the security gates were open. My understanding from speaking to other people is that this is normal. This clearly isn't accidental understaffing because of a one-off Covid crisis: it's obviously deliberate policy to lengthen the queues for the plebs who don't pay for ""fast track"", so that the airport can maximise revenues from people paying the ""fast track"" ransom. This cynical behaviour continues when you finally make it through security. After the enormous queue for security, we were pushed for time to get to our gate. We followed the signs for ""all gates"", which took us through an endless line of shops. We went up and down stairs. And eventually, we came out....into the security hall. To get to our gate quickly, it would be best to turn left out the security hall. But no. Everyone using those gates is forced to turn right and walk for more than ten minutes through shops they have no time to stop at, and then loop back to the security hall, walk through it, and then walk in the opposite direction to get to the gate. Honestly, I found this systemically-cynical management disgusting. It's clear that Manchester airport holds its passengers in contempt. It clearly doesn't have much time for the airlines, whose flights are delayed by the security failings, or for the shops, who are losing business because passengers don't have time to stop and spend money after standing for hours in unnecessary queues. So, whatever sort of customer you are - a passenger, an airline, or a shop operator - this airport does not care about you. I am flying to Britain again later this year. I'll be travelling to Blackpool. But I think I will add an hour of driving to my journey, and fly into and out of Birmingham. Manchester doesn't deserve my custom.",1.0
33,"We arrived late yesterday afternoon from Porto. Going through passport control was quick and well managed. However the collection of our luggage was a complete shambles. Never before have I witnessed passengers asleep whilst waiting for luggage! Poor parents were at their wits end trying to entertain children and also trying to keep them safe and away from the luggage belt that was just going round and round. The frustrating part was there wasn’t a single member of staff to be seen nor was there a single announcement. Don’t tell me there was nobody that should have been overseeing that chaos, the management needs serious attention for allowing a situation like that to manage itself. We waited over 2 hours for our luggage to arrive on the belt, longer than the flight to get there!",3.0
34,"It’s plainly evident that the airport cannot handle the passenger numbers going through it. Terminal 3 experience today was a shambles and not for the first time. Check in queues, horrific, Security queues, horrific. Lounges, nowhere near enough seating and restaurants can’t cope. People sat around on stairs lying on floors. They should not be allowed to have the airline traffic if they cannot provide the services that are required to go with it. Absolute disgrace of an airport.",1.0
35,"We landed at 07.15 nice and early, we were then sat waiting for airport staff to move gantry to plane Which took 25 minutes. Then we had a mile walk to passport control, when we arrived no staff working, it took 1 hour and 15 mins To clear passport control. Then we arrived at baggage collection the turntable was turning but not one case had been removed from the plane. We waited a further 35 minutes before the first case came onto the turntable. This airport is definitely not fit for purpose I will in future avoid at all cost. Airport parking is very expensive, and a minimum charge of £6.00 to drop/collect passengers. It just a big rip off airport.",1.0
36,"Travelling through Manchester airport is challenging at the best of times. The Airport suffers from a lack of investment and poor management which culminates in an environment that is unhealthy and over-commercialised. The challenge is that they lack high-value flights, and instead rely on a roster filled with budget airlines. These slots are low value, meaning that revenues have to be found (or costs saved) elsewhere. This means a very poor security experience - painfully slow even prior to COVID - and a post-security experience that's focused on wringing as much money from you as possible. Parking is extortionate, the only way to get through security with a modicum of speed is by paying extra for fast track, and if you want any level of sanctuary on your journey then you'll have to pay for a lounge. The Escape lounge is just a bar and low-value buffet that you pay entry to. Expect it to be filled with hen-parties and stag-do's, and the air filled with screeching and screaming and the smell of warm orange juice. If you're on one of the few premium flights then don't expect any luxury to start before you board the plane. Flying Emirates first class? Welcome to a confusing boarding process that means you're hemmed in with hundreds of people in a boarding area that would be looked down upon by a breakaway Soviet republic. The best part of Manchester airport is stepping off the airbridge and knowing that it will be another two weeks before you have to suffer it again. Landing in Manchester is no better - long queues, a baggage process that operates like a sloth, and your first toilet trip upon landing in the UK will be within a room that somehow manages to look dirty even after it's been cleaned. It's deeply painful that tourists travelling to our fair city have that as their first experience. The management team at Manchester Airport make out as if running a regional-ish airport is the toughest job in the World. If there's one thing they're good at it's blaming others but if they were to go through the living hell that is their own airport, and travel to places like Dublin or Boston, they would marvel at how it can be done.",2.0

Due to an issue with my diabetic medication and baggage I had to check in a bag and she took me to where I needed to go and stayed with me the whole time, keeping me calm. She was an absolute angel and there should be more like her. The rest of the staff at security were also very kind but Melissa stood out by a mile. I will be forever grateful to her.",10.0
40,"I'm surprised this airport is given 2/10! For me it's 0 in every category & they're lucky to get that! Dark, old, small and dirty terminals with no wifi and terribly demotivated, rude and unprofessional staff. Whether it's at the entrance, check-in, immigration, baggage handling or along the concourses, the staff need to be re-trained with immediate effect! They've been arrogant and uncooperative for years and it just isn't good enough! As a British person seeing how the staff treat/speak to visitors is quite frankly an embarrassment to the UK! Many of them get to visit England for the first time in their lives and they're met with patronising and sarcastic comments/attitudes. Disgraceful!",1.0
41,"The jewel of the North it isn't, flew through T3 which has only just opened post COVID, having seen all the hype on the media about how awful queues where I left enough time to get to the airport and get through security. T3 is so old and outdated, very lacking in seating and options for eating, I had to perch on a bin to enjoy my boots meal deal, but what shocked me more than anything was the blatant rudeness of the staff at security, barking orders at passengers, what happened to northerners are friendly? I'll just take the train up next time it's not worth the hassle",3.0
42,"Would give 0 rating if allowed. Elderly parents and relative, all aged 70+ arrived at T2 on 25th April. 2 other flights landed either side of their flight. They had to wait over 2 hours due to no trolleys being available to transport luggage, all they required was 1 trolley. Flight landed at 14.30 whilst they met us at 16.45. To add insult to injury, was charged (robbed) £30 for a stay lasting 2 hours 4 minutes. Airport is riddled with well documented problems, heads must toll. Brand shiny new terminal but no trollies, lack of staff and humongous security and passport control queues. Bring your own trolley if arriving at Manchester airport.

43,"I arrived at MAN in October 2921 before covid restrictions were eased so not busy and got through paspport and baggage inside 20 mins. Now it appears it's horrendous and the airport seem to always blame staff shortages but this is not accurate. My son worked there on security staff, he left after a few months because the organisation and management was absolutely abysmal. Organisation was so bad they didn't know what he could do although he has passed through training, every time he checked in he had no idea which area he was going to work in and when he finally was allocated to an area he joined other staff who were hanging around also not being allocated jobs to do.

Cues for security were out the door! Even with fast track it took far to long. Unfortunately, each time I have used this airport I tell myself I will never use it again. but this time has to be the last straw.

He had gone to put them through a scanner but did not tell us that was what he was doing. Security wasn`t as bad to get through, however they are shunting trays containing personal valuable possessions out of the security scanner and onto the conveyor belt at a rate of knots, and those possessions are exposed because they are not letting the people through the scanner fast enough to keep up with the baggage check - very worrying. 17 March return journey from Cape Verde with Tui, flight not showing on internet search. Even the Tui rep could not get any information. We were told that it would be delayed by at least two hours due to problems at Manchester Airport. Through social media we did find out that it was due to staff problems trying to deal with volume of passengers.

59,"Flight to Austria was scheduled to take off at 06.55 so arrived at the airport three hours before flight. Was shocked to see the queues at check-in/bag drop had filled the terminal area and were two hundred metres down the air bridge. It took two hours to get to the self-bag drop machines which refused to output the required tags for luggage, staff member printed all off separately and got us on our way. Wait, no we then had the joy of a one and a half hour queue for the ski drop scanner - apparently Manchester Airport has only one working scanner and this kept failing - at this point we were already thirty minutes late for take off and had yet to go through Security - another massive queue. Went straight down the fast track (without passes) and told the chap at the end that we were already late for the plane, after a detailed review of our boarding passes he let us through, even though we were then at the front of the queue, it still took a further twenty minutes to get through. Boarded the plane an hour after it should have taken off to find it waiting for the luggage to be loaded and other passengers to get through security. As an encore to this fiasco, we found that some of our luggage had been put on the wrong plane, honestly you could not make this stuff up. Manchester Airports response? ""We had an unexpected number of passengers"". I mean, it's not like the flights were scheduled and booked weeks ago is it. It was the same story on the return flight a week later. We took off three hours late from Innsbruck as the plane originally delayed in, yes you guessed it, Manchester! We landed two and a 1/2 hours late and it then took a further two and a half hours to offload the luggage from the plane. I feel sorry for the staff who have to deal with very frustrated passengers, this is not their fault. Management is non-existent they just keep booking the planes in even though they don't have enough trained check in staff, baggage handlers, security or border control staff. To add insult to injury you have to pay £5 to ""drop off"" passengers at this airport, even though you are stationary for circa sixty seconds, a total rip off.",1.0
60,"Appalling experience this morning - five hours after getting up at 4am on site, we were still on the tarmac. Queueing several hundred yards on the skywalk outside Terminal 2, no check in desks open as the baggage system had failed. When given our boarding cards, finally at the front of the queue, we had to go to a machine to weigh bags and print labels ourselves. Try figuring out how to attach an airline label when your brain is not working - another long queue to get the bags on the couple of functional conveyor belts apparently for the whole terminal. Security a complete nightmare, another very lengthy queue, the usual removal of boots as expected but even my little wooly cardigan had to go in a tray. My hand luggage was taken for inspection but nothing unacceptable was found, don’t know what that was about. Now half an hour to takeoff and no gate on the screen, but another flight with the same airline and destination was taking off at the same time from the C gates - adjacent to security, so we went there although no catering or duty free. Our gate was displayed twenty minutes before takeoff - a B gate - last call was promptly announced, so we had to sprint back to security and out the other side, through duty free etcetera, a further significant distance, to find seated passengers and yet more waiting for a bus to the plane. The plane took off nearly two hours late, as apparently our bags had been loaded on the flight which left from the C gate and vice versa. The level of incompetence attaching to these organisations is unbelievable.  Anything but Manchester Airport",1.0

There was no clear sign pointing where to go for Terminal 1 departures, just a lift with a very confusing list of options. I had no idea where to go which is very stressful for anyone who may have been held up and be in a rush to check in. I wondered if it was just me being stupid but as I hung around trying different lifts / different floors, the people I encountered along the way were also clueless as to where they had to go. Eventually I found my way but lost lots of time in the process. Why is there not a clear sign for Terminal 1 departures / check- in desks as you go into that entrance?!

Departure is still bad but arrival is absolutely awful. What's truly amazing is that it always seems a surprise that there are people coming into the airport. Staff are never added to remove queues and there is absolutely no sense of staff pride in working there.

From there you are guided to the yellow brick road of duty free winding round all the shops to get to the main area. Different food outlets on two levels and the lounges are at the back of beyond. Then came the time to get to the gates for departure another trek, again travellators not working and inexplicably it’s on two levels, no steps or a small lift down, the gate staff were disinterested, no directions as to seating for economy boarding or business, staff sat in a row of priority seats.

74,"Have been using MAN and LHR for transatlantic trips for 20+ years. MAN has always been very slow for check in and especially security clearance. This past week was the worst I have experienced ever. Stayed over in the airport hotel so we could enjoy a leisurely morning ahead of our 12.30 flight on Aer Lingus. Went to check in [doc check] at 9.20 a.m. (!!!!) with queue of maybe 15 people and 3 counters, looked good. Ended up taking 45 mins [staff break, general sluggishness then down to 1 counter as line swelled]. Entered security - unbelievable. Conga line was 4 layers deep and although 6+ lanes had staff, only 2 were open initially. When the doors had to be closed shut they finally opened more lanes but by then it was too late. Got through at 11.00 [yes 55 mins, which brings into question the published reports from MAN aiming for 92% of passengers through in <15 min??]. After a brisk 12 min walk (through the horrid commercial tack in T2) trying to find a restaurant, we see on the board we are asked to go to gate at 11.30 [~18 mins from now] hence no breakfast / relax. Thanks MAN - for a thoroughly lousy experience. We made it over the gate via the soul less A wing only to find that they would not in fact be boarding at 11.45, but 12.30. Aer Lingus staff seemed to be clueless and so many of them  sitting around doing nothing, and explains the lack of staff on check in desks pre-security. Overall very disappointing. Morning arrivals to MAN is not much better. On inbound leg, our flight landed at 5.45 am, and T2 has nothing open until after 7 am and even then it is a small coffee shop [all other shops have closed up], so be prepared to stand for 1h+ alongside a 200 yard queue of people waiting for Randox Covid testing to open [also at 7 am], as there are also no seats available. Car rental counters open at 8 on Saturdays, so no other options except hope for your early am flight to land later than published. Welcome to MAN. Typically [in 20+ years experience of MAN] security will take you at least 30 mins door to exit and check in seems to be also very slow, so the notion of being there 3h ahead of an international flight is actually very real [see above]. In my view this defeats the purpose of using a regional airport in the north. I can drive from LHR in less than 4h and the departing / arrivals is fast, professional, and reliable. Even more importantly, with multiple carriers, prices are MUCH cheaper due to competition so think very carefully before using MAN airport.",4.0

Lengthy walking also between terminals since the powered walkways were all out of commission, and the distances are not inconsiderable especially if you, like me, had a hip replacement operation quite recently.

79,Worst airport in the world! Check in and security were not too bad but the New Terminal 2 is terrible. It’s obviously just a money making racket. Not interest in passenger needs. Very expensive eating places. Only Smiths available to buy any essentials. No Boots chemist only land side which is no use if you can only take hand luggage and want to buy toiletries at the airport. I would like to know which architects designed this terminal because I think a child could have done better. The ladies toilets are a disgrace. The water from the taps hits the back of the basins and splashes water everywhere so if you don’t realise you get all wet. Only two hand driers - a disgrace for the number of passengers that pass through. Hopefully will not have to use Manchester much anymore and will go to Liverpool when I can. It is a much better airport. What a waste of money this terminal is. Also the signs for driving into the airport car park are terrible. We have not been to T2 since lockdown and did not realise the road changes. So we ended up in the drop off area when we were actually trying to get to Multi storey car park East.

The luggage when it eventually started to be delivered, appeared in dribs and drabs of 3-4 cases at a time with long periods of total inactivity, just what was going on? Needless to say there was no explanation provided for this prolonged delay, nor were there any handling agents available to enquire of. We were not the last to receive our luggage as there were 20-30 people still waiting after we left the baggage hall.

But Manchester Airport never fails to set new standards for its filthiness, over-commercialisation, and rip-off charges at all stages - parking especially. As a major gateway to the UK, the airport creates a disgracefully poor image for the UK. Compared to other major regional airport in comparable countries - take your pick of modern, spotless airports throughout Europe - Manchester Airport is a national embarrassment due to slovenly and greedy management. In normal times Manchester Airport makes several hundred million pounds of profit per year - enough to not fleece passengers for car parking (or even just dropping off - there’s no way to avoid the charges), and enough to maintain basic hygiene. For me, there is no worse Airport in the world.",1.0
93,"I am horrified by the treatment of the security staff. They kept me waiting for literally 1 whole hour just unpacking my whole suitcase, checking each one of my make up products, going over every single part of my suitcase, grabbing my toothbrush and swabbing it, as if they had never seen a toothbrush before. They just seemed to enjoy making a big deal out of absolutely every product within my bag, then said that products like toothbrushes and phone chargers need rechecking. I almost lost my flight due to their incompetence and rudeness. They did the same to a very old couple just ahead of me, the old lady having to sit down while his husband had to repack both their suitcases. Absolutely appalling behaviour from the staff at Manchester airport, I had already heard bad reviews and experiences by this was just a joke. I will try to avoid travelling from Manchester at all costs.",1.0
94,"I've been flying from Manchester since the mid 80's and always found it the best in my region for the choice of destinations. I lived abroad for a number of years and recently returned to live in the UK. This was my first foreign trip from Manchester in 10 years and I was appalled by the rudeness of the security staff. I'm used to travelling with hand luggage only. Normally I pop my case on, take out my laptop, clear bag with liquids in and place them in a tray. I have it all down to a fine art. Now this time I had to put my laptop in one tray, my liquids in another and my cabin bag in another. My mother also ended up with two trays, so five between two of us. We then had to queue for ages to get through the one and only metal detector in that area and the staff were shouting at everyone to move quickly. At the other end a snotty woman was shouting at people to pick up their trays and take to the packing area. That's all very well when you just have one, but five, seriously. When trying frantically grab things and condense into one tray so I can carry it to the crowded packing are with no space, she's shouting at me saying 'It's not rocket science!' I've never been treated with such rudeness. I then had my case searched because of a tiny pair of fold up nail scissors which have been all over the world with me in 10 years with no issues. Doncaster Sheffield airport is 20 min from me where the staff treat you with respect and I've already booked my next hol from there. You can get to many popular holidays destinations from there and it's clean, modern and friendly. Why would I drive for two hours to be treated like a piece of dirt by people whose wages I'm paying? Just because they work on security they think it gives them carte blanche to be rude and unprofessional. With a lack of passengers due to covid, airlines cutting back on flights and cancelling holidays the staff should be welcoming passengers not driving them away. I can't honestly see Manchester still operating 3 terminals this time next year. Terminal one is also grubby and dated. I used to live in Manchester and loved it but having been back several times in the last year I've experienced nothing but rudeness at both the train stations and now the airport. No wonder I've heard people referring to it as the 'Nasty Northwest' lately. Heathrow must deal with millions more passengers every year and it's much more polite and professional.",1.0
95,"For years the security personnel at Manchester have been the worst in the world, rude, cocky, arrogant, confused, then after the lockdown in July they transformed they polite, knowledgeable and spoke to their customers (yes customers, our business pays their wages) live humans rather than like dogs. Then comes September, obviously fed up with being polite they are back, they all have different instructions have not got a clue and so arrogant and rude, I’d rather drive 4 hours to Stansted they should at least all bark the same instructions I’d sack the lot of them if they worked for me, absolute morons.",1.0

Its a dreadful experience. We pay your wages, we are on a hard earned break and you ruin the start of it. Its appalling. As far as the lounges go the staff are a disgrace. You feel lucky to get in any lounge even though you have paid an annual fee. Hope the pandemic causes a mindset change. The only nice people at Manchester are Jet2 staff.

97,"Security was absolutely shambolic. Travelling with family/children? Avoid like the plague. Especially security B. Post lockdown levels of passengers yet still a long queue as only one scanner open. By the way, security B is a maze of stairs and hidden lifts. I’m travelling alone with a toddler who will not leave my side during security yet it’s insisted I stand alone in the body scanner. Toddler leaves my side for no more than 5 seconds, and security staff grab her by the wrist and pulls her away from me in the scanner, whilst another coworker fails in his attempts at entertaining/distracting my toddler with a tray. Toddler freaks out with the woman grabbing her by the wrist and ends up getting extremely upset and clinging to my leg and screaming at the top of her lungs. I sternly ask her not to do that as she’s hurting and upsetting my already stressed child. She would not have grabbed an adult by the wrist and pulled like she did to my daughter, whilst my daughter panics and cries out for me. I ask if we can’t just go through the walk through scanner, and she says no - the rules are that if the body scanner is available I must be scanned in that, and that she’s just doing her job. So they finally decide to do a complete search instead. A supervisor turns up to hover but has nothing useful or comforting to say. When I tell her we were forced to go through the body scanner travelling alone with a child, the woman pipes up and says we weren’t forced to go through it. And says this repeatedly, contradicting me. However, I was certainly not offered a choice!! Meanwhile my daughter is begging and crying for her pacifier which is on the tray going through the bag scanner rolls eyes which I’d been asked to send through with the bags because it was bulging in my pocket. She pats me down. Then tells me she also needs to do the same to my daughter (having man handled her earlier). I explain to my daughter what’s about to happen (woman tries to tell my daughter she’s going to give her a tickle), woman looks to me for approval, and I tell her to just do it quickly and get it over with. A completely unnecessarily stressful experience with zero consideration nor respect for children. Utterly poor customer service.",1.0

If I can avoid this airport in the future I will at all costs. I made a comment to my husband how inefficient this security process was. Well big mistake because one of the ladies heard me and proceeded to rip me a new one for 5 minutes in front of my children. I even told her to stop talking to me like that in front of my kids and she said she is concerned with my behavior and what I will be like on the plane if I’m told something I don’t like. Really lady! Get a life. Never ever had this experience. Avoid this place like the plague if you can. I am mortified with the way they treat people.",1.0
101,"My partner and I have vowed never to use this airport again. I was expected to place my asthma inhalers in the liquids bag (they are powder) and put out my hair straighteners separately. No other airport does this. Security check staff were shambolic and incompetent, and also rude. The time from placing articles in the trays to leaving the security area was over an hour. My partner's trays were scanned and diverted to the additional check area. The member of staff asked the question ""has anyone interfered with this tray since you packed it"". Only the security staff had access to it! He then returned the trays to the scanner, one of which was again diverted. The tray with his coat was sent through. Another member of staff picked up the tray from the middle of the rapidly-filling conveyor and returned it to be put through the scanner again. This time the tray and contents were ok to be collected. All the time this was happening, two customer interviewers were completing interviews on their tablets themselves, without referring to customers. There were also Union people milling around with clipboards. It was complete chaos, with disgruntled customers hanging around waiting for their trays and the staff not doing their jobs. When one customer stated that no other airport in the UK goes through such measures, he was told ""no other airport cares about your security"".",1.0

It must be a thankless task but they do give the impression of not caring how long they take. If they check a bag you get the full treatment at their pace. Camera out. Book out. Laptop already out. I tried to retrieve my handkerchief to deal with an incipient sneeze and actually got my hand slapped with the search wand. Really. Perhaps they wanted my germs? But that is not my chief gripe with this rip off. We pay a few bob in landing fees to use the place and they cannot even supply a trolley without stealing another quid off you. I know of no other airport that charges for luggage trolleys. It is not as though they are not making money from the forced march through acres of shops that create an obstacle course on your way to the gate. And to cap it all they are now removing any payphones that one can use to call friends and family to advise progress and arrange pick up. What a place. And they talk about a £1Bn improvement plan. Well I can tell them where they should spend that kind of money in providing a decent place to fly from. Seats. Signs and service to those paying for it. I can't say 'Never again' as sadly I need to use it to serve my travel needs.",2.0

No contingency planning, no capacity for remedial action. Complained to customer services - in their response they said their target wait was fifteen minutes and they were implementing a programme of customer service training. I explained that this was not the point. In view of their waiting target they had failed by 500% and no amount of smiling at people would cure chronic management failures on that scale. Hopeless. Liverpool is now my preferred gateway to the North West.

107,"Departures: Terminal 1 is acceptable excluding the drop-off and parking. First you go through the check-in hall which is fairly spacious but needs a do-over but it only gets worse from there. Next you go down a fairly small set of stairs into security. T1 security is a packed, stuffy, low-ceilinged hellhole of a room. Luckily I got through there fairly fast and into the departures lounge, which is the best part of the terminal - it is modern, open and packed to the brim with toilet facilities and shops, along with a travel-money stand, which is quite useful. Unfortunately there is a long hike through a department store to get to the gates. On the other side of the store the were some fast-food chains and a large window with a bench and table running across it. This is a plane-spotter's paradise. My flight was at gate 21 which I found to be downstairs, on a wall there was an illustration and some writing saying that there was free wifi for 3 hours, never used it though as I was on my mum's hotspot. We took a packed to the brim bus to parking stand 71, past where the FedEx 757 hibernates during the day to our Thomas Cook airbus A321. It was raining out (no surprise) and we had to take slippery, corrugated steps up the the narrow-body airbus which could have had something over it to make it less dangerous.

The facilities are old and tatty, the staff are rude and uncaring and the security staff have no consistency in the way they manage. Over the past 10 years I have seen a gradual and steady decline in standards. The Manchester Airport Group (MAG) have recently introduced pickup and drop off charges. They will not doubt defend that decision as helping to reduce vehicle traffic, or even under the banner of some environmental initiative. Well, I don’t believe them. This in my opinion is yet another cynical attempt to extract more money from travellers. Will it help to fund improvements in infrastructure or improve passenger experience? I don’t think so.

When we finally got to the barriers there were 4 lanes that all had to turn left to get in with no dedicated lanes we had to edge in bumper to bumper and side of car to side of car so close there was beeping/shouting and we could hear arguments at the barriers to get out too. You drive all the way round on the ground level to the disabled bays where are friends have to wait as they are disabled. Cars where trying to back out to exit and had nowhere to go as we where all coming in, they were forcing there way out because of the charges and time limits and even unconcerned about pedestrians with cases and children trying to find there taxis or lifts. We could not park our poor friends had to jump in the car as we gradually moved along, then we too had to queue to get out. It took longer to get in/out of this awful car park than it did for our friends to get off the plane collect their cases and get through security.

118,"T2 Dreadful place. As an older person who has stopped running marathons years ago, T2 is by far the most unusable airport in the world for people who are not ""disabled"" but have some mobility issues. I understand the theory of having to wind your way through duty free after the undermanned under resourced security area and the miles of cattle fencing for check-in. I was told off for not using it even when it was empty. (we are forced to check in mega early for these reasons). We wont mention the bars full of drunks first thing in a morning. After leaving the Aspire or Escape lounges which themselves are pretty poor compared to the rest of the world. The walk to the gates is several hundred yards at least, too much for families and the elderly and as yet the walkway has never been working. (its only short anyway) I have been there when the lifts were not working either. So unless you set off to the gate the instant is shows on the screens you will be late and incur the wrath of rude ground staff. The sit down on the aircraft is most welcomed IF you don't have to wind round steps and up steps to the aircraft. This is too much for some people and very definitely a security risk, that is another story. Don't mention special assistance, it takes forever, no staff, no chairs, wrong size etc, etc. plus it precludes you from having an extra legroom seat, and we are the people in most need of the legroom. Coming back is something to be feared, it is over 1 kilometer from the gate to the pick-up point and even for able bodied people dragging cases and children is a very long way. Landed at 14.05 today and it was over 1 hour 40 minutes before we were on our way and most of that was walking, blistered feet exhausted. It is an extra 30 minutes by car to Liverpool for us so we would have been home before we even left Manchester airport.

We weren't thrilled at the prospect, having avoided Manchester for some years now on the basis of its size and overcrowding. In the event, things were much better than expected, mainly because both flights were at quiet times of day. Passage through security took only a few minutes and, though both of us had our hand luggage selected for separate inspection, the security staff were very pleasant and in no way officious. On our return, we were quickly through the electronic passport gates and actually back to our car in JetPark 1 within 20 minutes or so of landing. So, as far as the basic function of transit from car park to plane and back again was concerned, we had no problems at all. I would still say, however, that Manchester airport is somewhere I would prefer to avoid: some of the signage is confusing, many of the seats in the main central area of Terminal One were ripped and in need of replacement and the route from plane to terminal exit seemed to involve several staircases up or down. The sight of the extensive chicanes at security and passport control, not in use when we transited, was also a clear indication of what the airport must be like at peak times. As for finding one's way around the exterior of the airport, I can only be glad that all we needed was to access JetPark 1 and let the transfer bus drivers do the rest!

This leaves visitors feeling stressed, aggrieved and ripped off. For half an hour of parking in this national embarrassment we paid seven pounds! The staff who run this place ought to take some of their loot and jump on a plane to visit the beautiful, clean, spacious, well-run airports at Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban for some lessons in how an airport can be a pleasant place to visit.

There were two staff members some distance along and when I drove up to them they explained that this was the first day of a new process under which only pre-booked cars could use that car park. (Good luck with that-my experience of pre-booking that car park has been that it is still very stressful trying to find a space.) They directed me to another car park, using a pre-printed card which they showed me but did not hand over. I could not find it and ended up parking at terminal 3 and walking with my son back to terminal 1, but I still had to pay £3 for 1 minute to get out of the car park I hadn't been allowed into, plus an additional £4.50 for the 21 minutes at terminal 3. So £7.50 for 22 minutes. This is nothing more or less than gouging in my opinion. The security process at the airport is appalling-it was more pleasant going through Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin before the wall came down. I've done both. I will only use Manchester airport if there is no alternative.",1.0
130,"I am a KLM platinum frequent flyer taking somewhere between 60-100 flights a year, to many places in Europe and most major continents. Manchester airport is the worst airport for a major city I have visited in the last 10 years. No airside transit between easyJet and Flybe even though it is possible to do so with other airline combinations. A security screening system which is totally over the top compared with any airport I have visited anywhere in the world. Even mascara is considered a potentional threat to the safety of the aircraft! An asthma ventolin inhaler loose in the tray was rejected as not in a plastic bag. When asked why this was a problem was told terrorists use them as detonators. Presumably outside the plastic bag they are undetectable, but inside, can be. All in all, a Mad Hatter's Tea Party. A lot of shouting and incoherent orders given by staff adding to the confusion in screening. A general surliness of staff adds to the unpleasantness I'm sorry the people of Manchester have to put up with the ""airport experience"". I will not be using this airport again. The attached photo is a collection of normal travellers items in baggage which were rejected and had to be re-screened. All were considered as 'potentially compromising the safety of the aircraft'. Judge for yourselves!",1.0
131,The airport is dated and needs work doing to it. The cost of parking is extortionate and clearly a way of making money out of the innocent people who have no choice to fly through here. The check in lines are huge as we fly with Qatar airways. The plane houses over 450 people and when I asked if they could open a new check in desk as 3 were open they said Manchester Airport doesn't give the facility for this to occur. The duty free options are over priced and can be seen as money making. It cost me over £17 for a 2 person meal in burger king something that you'd never pay out in the UK. The whole airport is centred around making money rather than the experience it's passengers have. T2 is dated and not really an experience anyone should want to go through. Invest some money into the airport and get it more integrated with experience rather than money making.,6.0
132,"Absolutely disgraceful for an ""international airport"". If you're flying from the new terminal 2 building you would do well to find another airport. The recently finished gates are a very very long way from check-in with only 2 quite short travelaters. If you struggle walking any length do get assistance. We've just landed and here's how it went. Touch down, add 15 minutes for taxiing to gate. Add about 30 minutes for the long walk back to your bags- passport control etc. Now add about an hour for your bags, remember they have to travel all the way from the plane too. We touched down at about 8pm and left the airport at 9.40. Whoever is responsible for the build and design of that terminal needs sacking and it's quite clear that they had no idea on movement of people. Manchester had never been great at moving people through the system but they just took a significant backward step.",1.0
133,"Terminal 2 now has new gates numbered A1-12. The entry to this section is at the end of the existing departure lounge and is about a ten minute walk from security, on entering area A1-12 you are advised that there is a 15 minute walk to the furthest gate, we went from gate A11, I have some mobility problems but have always managed at Manchester so did not ask for assistance on the way out. There was no official anywhere in the area, about 8 chairs in two well spaced lots and two small lengths of travelator, both of which were working. If you can't walk half a mile plus in 15 minutes arrange assistance at Manchester Airport, this is handled via your travel company and the people helping are great, friendly and efficient. On returning some of the gates are just as far away from the customs hall, then there is the ten to fifteen minute walk to the only pick up car park, a short part of this walk is in the open, this time you will be pulling your luggage. Gates A1-12 are badly designed no help available when you realise the distance to be covered to your plane, with only two travellators along the whole length, and only two places to rest. Again if you have the slightest problem with your mobility pre arrange assistance.",1.0

He said my wife has them shared as we are only away for a couple of days. He was told next time he must have his own! I collected the tray with my family's phones, tablets, money, jewelry, passports etc in to be told to leave them and come and supervise my 8 year old have a personal body search. I tried to collect valuables first and they shouted I had to leave them. I refused as I have previously read about theft from security trays in this airport. The guy shouted to everyone ""ok she's leaving her child to look after her things"". They then lost one of my boots which they later Found under a counter. My daughter's tray was also lost with her coat and bag in. It was found on a trolley and had not even been placed through the scanner. We had nothing removed and followed all the procedures. We were treated with aggression and distain.

We know it is a tough but necessary job and we perhaps make it harder by a), being there in the first place and b), by being human, but for pity's sake, there is no need to bully passengers with your silly little power trips. You get away with it because people just want to get on a flight, anywhere outside of your little bubble, and you probably wouldn't be so rude, officious, arrogant and patronising, and if you were, you would not get away with it. We don't want you to be there just as much as you don't want us there, but such is our world.

136,"I have previously been an advocate of Manchester Airport, but not any more. On my return to Manchester from Dubrovnik the passage through Customs and Security was adequate. However, baggage reclaim was a disaster. The baggage carousel was turning when we arrived so all looked promising. 30 minutes later, with the carousel still turning, no bags. Finally, two bags arrived and then the carousel jammed. Despite there being other empty carousels it took another 30 minutes for it to be fixed. And then the final insult. Collected my car from meet and greet and all seemed well. However the next morning in the light of day, I noticed a dent on my bonnet. Clearly I couldn't know if this had been done whilst i was driving home, so I asked for a copy of the photographs which are taken automatically as cars arrive at meet and greet.

On return a few days later everything went like clockwork.

140,"I arrived at MAN from CDG after transferring from an international flight. You get on a bus to transfer processing, go through security, and get on another bus to your terminal. The buses come every 10-15 minutes. Just so you know how it works in Manchester’s less than perfect world. I go through security. I’m scanned and frisked. The security people took out everything – infinitesimal amounts of gels, creams, liquids and brushes (really, are brushes weaponized now?) from my bag and told me to put them in a quart size container. I had to throw away a number of larger containers with tiny bits inside. Security kept saying “your airline makes us to this.” Right. Not DL or AF or any other airline I’ve flown during my millions of miles of travel. Then they tell me to go to T2 to get my connection. I go out the door and into the elevator. The lounges are above. I go there. And no one will let me in. I’m flying Business Class. A security worker sees this and says I am in T1, not T2. He says this happens all the time (probably because there are no signs). So, he walks me down to the transfer bus. And it won’t take me from T1 to T2. I need to go through security again. Again, scanned, frisked, my infinitesimal paraphernalia taken out and put in a bag. Now I find out T2 is only accessible from the lower level. Upstairs are the lounges for T1. Where's the sign? The elevator opens onto another sad little “bussing” room to T2. I get to a lounge in T2 and I’m told I can’t come in. I ask for a manager and she apologizes and tells me I can come in because I'm flying Business. And my name is on the “list.” The lounge has a few seats, miserable food, no bathroom, but thankfully a self-serve bar which I made good use of. Total transfer time: 2 hours. Never again will I fly Virgin, AF, or Delta through Manchester and neither should you– transferring through this airport is like traveling through all the levels of hell.",2.0

There is very little I can consider as even pleasant about this airport. I have been a KLM Platinum frequent Flyer for the last 8 years and do over 40 flights a year in and out of Manchester to Amsterdam and then onwards through to Asia/US/Europe etc. For the convenience I use Manchester and mainly because of its rail connection between York and the airport (even this has its moments of despair but that's for another day) From the moment I step of the train I see nothing but faces (station platform through to airport security) that are really not interested in what they do and far less interested in people travelling through, in fact ""passengers"" are their nightmare. The Northern rail staff are horrendous, rude and ignorant. Do you know there are no ""TV Screens"" anywhere displaying the departures of trains until you have actually gone through the ticket barrier and entered the platform zone before one can find out the times and destinations of a train ... pathetic, and try asking any of the station staff for that information is as if you have requested them to give you £20. Passing through the ticket barrier on the 24th Oct at about 09:00 hours I counted 10 staff members on the inside of the barrier stood in pairs, my ticket was ""rejected"" by the barrier sensor so the gate remained closed, I tried to draw the attention of a staff member of my predicament, first think I was asked, do you have a valid ticket? Yes Sir I do. ""Let me see it"" by all means Sir, he scrutinised my ticket and said ""Is in order and should work"" Well well well what a surprise, I was instructed to try it again. Nope the barrier remained closed, he called a colleague who also checked my ticket and would you believe it they had to bring in a 3rd fellow with a ""magic key"" to open the barrier, which did not work, and I had to use another barrier and try my ticket again there to no avail, before a new key was introduced and I was eventually allowed to gain entry to the ""railway side of the platforms"" My principle terminal for KLM is T3, probably the longest walk from the station and I mean walk because the travelators' scarcely work, over the past 3 weeks (I have has 6 visit's in this time in and out) there has been a group of ""engineers"" working on them and just yesterday I returned, no engineers and the travelator heading out was inoperative. Just a word of caution on this walkway from station to T1&T3 when it rains the floor is a hazard but to the leaking arch roof. The elevators to get to down from the walkway to the level where T3 pathway are so slow when there are so many users about, I have found an alternative route via T1 arrivals but my word its a straggle. Depends on airline I suppose for check-in but I generally use KLM/AirFrance with a priority pass through ""security"" thankfully but this is another experience in itself, miserable people employed to ensure you don't have liquids, gels, electrical stuff etc. I'm done moaning as I have better things to do but I'm back in to T3 again on Monday 28th Oct with KLM and returning (Airfance 7th Nov) and do you know I'm expecting the same shambles as I have seen for so many years already.

Again the staff were badly trained and extremely discourteous. I completely understand the need and time for security but these people were abrupt and ill mannered. We then had a quarter of a mile walk to our Tui boarding point in terminal 2 with no travelators working. There were older and slightly infirmed people and people with children really struggling. On our return part of the aircraft luggage arrived after 15 minutes and ours along with the rest arrived 30 minutes later.

I should have known better actually after my first experience but the destinations in Europe I was flying to did not have direct flights from any other airport. Where do I even begin? The airport is simply not fit for purpose. The staff are rude, the facilities are appalling and everything costs money. I mean I haven't been to any other airport on the planet that charges money for pick-up and drop-off (GBP 3 to pick up passengers and GBP 4.50 to drop-off passengers). I travel a lot and I haven't seen this in even the remotest African airports. And those airports are in a much better condition than MAN. I understand security is an issue and the staff are only being cautious, but for goodness sake they need to use some common sense. My bag was rejected every single time because I had bought a model aircraft (made of die-cast metal) and apparently this was causing some issue with the scanner. So my bag was ripped apart, contents scattered everywhere and even after visually inspecting the model, they sent my bag to be re-scanned. I passed through STR, ZRH and CPH airports with the same bag containing the same model aircraft without any issues, but apparently in MAN they cannot seem to understand what a scale-model die-cast model aircraft looks like. Also, staff are rude and unpleasant to deal with. No attempts are made at any pleasantries or even acknowledging a simple hello. And what do they do with all the money they collect from passengers and people using the car parks and drop-off and pick up zones? The airport facilities are in a terrible state. Toilets are filthy, leaking and unpleasant. The lounge facilities are woefully inadequate (they were turning people away from the Aspire Lounge in T2 because it was full, even though there were seats in between) and they demand you show your boarding pass for everything. I bought a cadbury chocolate (99p) and was asked to show my boarding pass.

So here's a number of highlights of my most recent visit: 1) Typically when you land you get an indication of what airport and what terminal you are in. Its actually pretty useful so that you might be able to, you know, order a taxi. Manchester Airport - Fail. It would not even be too difficult to remedy this, but they spend more on figuring out how to extract cash from passengers, but that leads and is linked to the next point. 2) Not only are they profiteering by having extortionate pickup and drop off charges, but actually Manchester Airport appears to be cynically trying to add to this cash by making the signage infuriatingly difficult. As a passenger being picked up at terminal 3, the signs tell you to cross the road into the car park into the multistory, then turn left but once outside there are no subsequent signs to tell you to turn right. Add to this the surly staff makes it impossible to figure out where you need to be. I asked one of the Parking Enforcement people how to get to the pick up area, his response, and I quote ""Its not my job to tell people how to get to the pickup areas"". No you just slap the £100 fine on if people get it wrong because the signs are so bad. 2a) My taxi driver was new and only by chance I mentioned to him not to go to the drop-off point but the pickup point, which itself is badly sign posted, and the exit is frustratingly difficult to find.

Ryanair staff were very unfriendly too and not helpful at all. They even gave the impression they enjoyed sending us away. We had to stay at the airport for another 8 hours before flying to Hamburg via Düsseldorf with Eurowings. 2 new tickets cost us 382 pounds. The experience was very distressing and we had no offer of help from Ryanair, on the contrary I phoned them twice but still no offer of help. I logged onto their live chat and got just an automated answer. Terminal 3 is a disgrace for Manchester.",1.0
166,"Our party of 6 were all in agreement (as was another couple behind) that the customer service agents bar 1 in terminal 1 departures at approx 3.30am 2 October was atrocious! They were stood around talking, despite a number of travellers struggling to use what to us were newly installed easyjet self baggage. They spoke to a number of travellers as though they were a hinderance. In particular, a man stood at what was signposted 'security' just kept jabbing his finger towards another area and telling us to move along! No explanation was given! The difference when we arrived in Lanzarote was so apparent that they value customer service. What should have been a great start to our holiday was so marred by their what can only be described as 'sour' faces. I really hope that the powers that be at Manchester airport take on board our criticisms and roll out a programme of retraining for their customer service agents. If they aren't happy in their work (which was so apparent this morning) they should be replaced.",3.0

168,What a dump! I used to use Manchester quite a lot in the nineties. None of the electric walkways worked then. They got the Commonwealth Games and suddenly it was all fixed. I doubt if anything has been fixed since! First of all none of the electric walkways function. That means walking all the way. Why do you have them if you aren't going to maintain them and keep them running? Of course I could have used a baggage trolley. After all they are free at all airports. Did I say all? Manchester charges 2 euros to use a trolley and it is not refunded! Once through all the controls I got to my gate. Most of the seats were so old that they had actually broken. So where your bottom goes has actually collapsed. Very uncomfortable. Also between the seats was the filth of ages. Stuffed in the cracks were sweet wrappers etc. which must have been there for weeks if not months. Why is there absolutely no signage to the smoking area? The staff could not have been more pleasant or helpful. Full marks for that. Otherwise a very dire experience.,1.0
169,"By far the worst airport experience ever. A massive queue to get through passport control. You have to walk down a tunnel for about four mins to get to the T2 West car park where you can meet your taxi. I saw an old man struggling with a walking stick, suitcase and ruck-sack. Trying to find your taxi is mayhem and you get scammed on top of that with their extortionate parking charges. What is Manchester Airport playing at, you're a disgrace!",1.0
170,"Absolute disgrace. Couldn't wait to get out. More like a 1960's general hospital building than a major airport. Looking around there is nothing but works in progress and equipment out of order. Nothing is ever finished, its all make do and mend. There was even a sign on a non working escalator that said ""this escalator will be switched off at peak times due to health and safety reasons"". Whoever is in charge here and allows this sort of thing should be ousted. An employee told me the travelators in the new terminal pier were also not working! There are so many aspects of service that other airports manage without an issue but they are beyond Manchester. If he himself had any competence, the leader of the City of Manchester (which is a major shareholder) would personally intervene. There is need for a wholesale change of culture here. The ""don't care"" attitude should be banished.",1.0
171,"Despite arriving very early and also paying for fast track access, it still took security staff 30 minutes to check my bag which the scanner didn't like. Of course they are doing their job so no issue being screened, but all fast track passengers were being screened by 1 member of staff. They were 10 other staff stood around chatting to each other and simply not interested in how they could help travelers nor the very small minority of staff who were working very hard. I complained 3 times to a member of staff during the 30 minutes who was engaged, friendly, courteous and somewhat sympathetic, but completely powerless to help as management could not be found to move staff from empty areas of the hall to help the backlog. In the end they adjusted the settings on the scanner to allow more bags to pass through. This type of back log has on occasion separated travelers from their screened bags and I have seen travelers on two separate occasions have valuables apparently stolen causing much upset and a dilemma over whether they stay and resolve the issue checking CCTV or whether they go catch their flight. I travel in and out of Manchester airport every other week and the general standards in the check in halls, security areas and departure gates are extremely poor. I have traveled through airports in developing countries that far outweigh the standards in MAN. I think the facility is processing far too many customers per day which is resulting in endless delays and an extremely poor customer experience. Even paying extra to circumnavigate long queues via Fast Track Lanes etc are no longer working. This evening I transited through MAN airport from CPH onto LHR and had to wait for Border Staff for 30 minutes just to process passports for transfer passengers. Even the security staff at the scanners close-by were not remotely surprised at the delays, which were quite normal, and general low level of service provided. They rang up 3 times for Border Staff to come down and process transfer passengers. Once at the front of queue I said that I would like to make a polite complaint about the delays and the member of staff in question looked at me in the most incredulous way. I did not make a formal complaint, nor want to, but just wanted to respectfully point out that sitting around for 30 minutes waiting for someone to be bothered to show up and process the various arrivals, with a transfer flight imminent more importantly, simply wasn't fair. I suspect I was just labelled as a trouble maker which I am not. I fly every week and the difference between the service between MAN and other larger airports like LHR or BHX couldn't be more different. In fact the service between MAN and DSA, a much smaller regional airport, couldn't be more different. Typically a flight out of MAN will be much more expensive than one out of LHR, LGW or LCY so I am paying considerably more for a much inferior service. In talking to some of the staff this evening, the suggestion was that management couldn't care less.",1.0
172,"This airport quite rightly gets poor reviews. Sometimes the poor facilities and long queuing times are alleviated by cheerful staff. Not last week. My complaints are the same as most other travellers but this time Security seemed to make up their own rules. My liquids were contained in a clear plastic bag 20cm x 20cm. Product is Anrui and has a zip and is marked as ok for airport use. It is durable and so is more environmentally sound than the single use bags. This year I have used it without query at East Midlands, Luton, Malaga, Vancouver, Nanaimo, Anchorage and Gatwick. The security officer refused to allow it so I was forced to repack my few things in their flimsy bag. I dare not complain as I had a plane to catch!

175,"Manchester Airport - an absolute disgrace to the North of England and an utter shambles. Last year I visited Manchester Airport with my elderly father. My sister tried dropping us off near the terminal but you are faced with an unloading time and a £4 penalty for dropping a passenger off at the airport. I have travelled for 25 years in business around the globe and never experienced being charged to go to an airport. Before we could take a wheelchair we had to walk to check in and back to disabled centre. He is 91 at the time, not crippled but elderly so distance isn't great but we had no option. Once checked in there was no one to wheel him so with 2 hand baggage and a wheelchair I had to manage 1 handed. The disabled ramps are crude and jolty, the roped diversions too narrow to negotiate easily. It is an ugly place. My sister had to then go and park and pay again. Minimum of £7 per hr so we are now at £14. The year before I had to travel with him and we couldn't get a lift so we drove. There was no easy way of me dropping him off at the terminal to sit and wait. Thankfully after begging the traffic man he let me stop for 2 mins. It took 30 mins to return due to wrong directions given. This year I drop my friend off, £4 to drop off, we tried to read the type before entering its impossible to read without causing a traffic jam. So we go round to mid term car park, again no proper signage and directions. We arrive in the car park, £7 / hr! Its a muddy wet place with no drainage, ramps to pavements in the wrong places, no clear directions. Once inside its dirty the toilets stink, its ugly as hell and the check in area just has to be the most ill thought out space in the UK. What happened to this glamorous airport of the 70s and 80s it was clean efficient and great looking. I think the airport should be closed - its the worst example of the UKs hospitality and such a great example of shortsighted greed. Such a great great shame.",1.0

Each time it just gets worse and worse and it's only when you compare it to other airports just as busy such as Zurich or Tel Aviv that you realise how 3rd world it has become. Departed Swiss from Terminal 1. Nowhere to sit either in lounge or Starbucks. Security is now in a basement in what can only be described as a converted cattle shed. Staff kept shouting warnings to make sure there were no fluids in our hand luggage or we could miss our flight if they had to search it. Of course I'd forgotten to place my inhaler in a plastic bag but this was resolved quickly. As usual escalators weren't working so have to shlepp hand luggage up and down stairs.

MAG should take customers around the area to find out if they can follow the directions given, without having to double back with heavy suitcases when you find a set of stairs (gate 32 and I wasn’t the only one). Once inside the airport is crowded with limited areas in walkway, with machinery that should alleviate the issues such as moving walkways turned off.

And all this time the supervisor hasn't a clue to realize that all the extra security work and passenger misery is being caused by a shortage of trays at the start and doing absolutely nothing about it.

To my absolute horror, he slammed it back at me and pushed it straight into my rib cage and proceeded to scream at me.

What a disaster nothing appeared to be moving due to the roads outside the carpark being choc-a -block. Why on earth were there several police men just hanging around watching all of this chaos and doing nothing about it. Perhaps it was because if was absolutely pouring down and they didn't want to get wet.

The immigration hall itself crammed tight with the usual snake of people waiting for either the automated booths or an immigration officer. All the immigration desks were in use. Clearly, Manchester Terminal 2 is not adequately sized or manned to meet the current need of early morning traffic. We felt like cattle going to slaughter. Staff were broadly harassed and could not do anything more than they were so both they and passengers were annoyed. Airport managers clearly forget that we, the passenger ultimately pay for the service, or in this case lack of service, and therefore their jobs! It was doubly frustrating to see the huge posters advertising that they would be opening a new, bigger and better arrivals hall in 2020. It felt like we could be there long enough to see it open. When eventually we got through our bags were not yet on the carousel because an earlier Virgin flight from Atlanta was still on the belt. Total shambles.

There are only 3 short travelators, and they are generally switched off. I have only seen all 3 working on one occasion, and that was today. Immigration seems to be perpetually short of staff, and the automatic passport recognition machines must have been bought at a discount warehouse, considering the numbers of passengers who get rerouted through to an officer.

How can this be the case when he went to board 1hr before departure time? He had to push to the front to ensure he didnt miss his flight! Having found out what you have to do with the said token, you place it in the machine in the building, again no instuctions and it cost me £10.00 + £3.00 from earlier. Welcome to Manchester. What a rip off. Never again, it was horrible. Some years ago I travelled from Manchester and it was much better than this. The CEO of this shambles of a airport should hang their head in shame. I doubt it though, they know no shame and will keep trousering their huge salary and pension contributions.",1.0
213,"This review is intended for the airline I was flying (which I cannot name) and Manchester Airport Security to suggest better communication with one another in order to ensure that no other customer is forced to endure the aggravation and expense I have just experienced. It began at the luggage drop - where I asked for assistance but none came until too late. I had a combined luggage allowance of 30kg. Packing my cases I had one with 14kg and one with 16 kg, which by my math came to 30kg. Unfortunately I put the smaller bag on first and when I put the larger bag on, I was told to remove one kilo from my bag. This was in fact my wash bag- and checking with the airline employee I was assured that since I had no article of more than 100ml there would be no problem at Security. How wrong he was- the small plastic bag given at security – UK rules say should be 20cm x 20cm but Manchester Security obviously has its own sized bags (19cm x19cm) causing me to have to dispose of some rather expensive hypoallergenic make up. I was further asked to remove my money belt – which I have never been asked to do at any other airport in the world. Since I have a hip replacement I almost always have to go through separate X-ray security- but the young lady who scanned me was extremely officious and I would say passively aggressive. One pleasant security official, who I cannot name, did try and help and took me to the Head of Security to lodge a complaint. That young man- Head of Security, was supercilious and condescending and after a very short period of time I realised my complaints were falling on deaf ears. As I see it, I have two solutions available to me; one is to stop flying with the airline I have flown with for over 10 years, and the second is to stop flying out of Manchester. Since I have been flying with the particular airline since its inception - (but out of Luton or Gatwick) and have never encountered such poor service, I am left only with the option of not flying out of Manchester. I realise that this is probably of little interest to you - but I promise you I will be informing all my family, friends and colleagues of the poor customer service I suffered today. I look forward to your response.",1.0

215,"Security here is a joke, we missed our flight because the screening took so long and they said it was fast. It was not. We waited at least 25 to 30 minutes to get through and by then the gates were already closing. Baggage check-in was also poor, we waited nearly 30 minutes for that too. They called our names out then I ran towards the gate leaving my wife behind which I shouldn't have to do, from the moment they called our names they waited 2 minutes literally, before closing the gates. Anyone who's been here will know the exit for the security screening is not 2 mins away from gate 27. Its more like 10 mins to 15 if walking normal pace. We missed our flight at the end even though they took 20 minutes to remove the baggage off the plane when they could have let us through. I knew Thomas Cook was an absolute risk and a joke and I took this same trip last year with Virgin without a single issue. The staff are also rude! Not all of them though. Just the certain idiots with their miserable existence that don't want to be there. I've now booked another flight for an extra £600 simply because security is terrible in this airport. Last year in terminal 1 people waited way more than 20 mins even though they said it should be less than 15 minutes. Last years complaints went through the roof regarding security and staff. Exactly what I'm complaining about here. If everything just moved along quicker like it does with other airlines then I'd be on that plane with my wife. Now a £1300 pound holiday turned into £1900 with fewer days aswell. Absolute joke!! The statistics show that this airport is the worst in the country for unhappy people. 1 in every 17 people have said they have been very dissatisfied with the service and no doubt this will be majority towards Thomas Cook. You literally get what you pay for.",1.0

Off plane and into hire car in well under an hour. Returned car 2 weeks later, night in Radisson Blu on site hotel. Checked in 2 hours before flight, no queue. Always have the issue of our 27 hr stay in Singapore on way home. Took a supervisor to book bags through the long layover.

218,"Absolute chaos and confusion. When I first arrived, no one was there to guide you, you had to just follow the other people. Security guided people through quickly and just a scan of your passport and go through metal detectors. Not bad but odd. No real welcome to the city. The luggage claim area is big, dark and stark. I had no clue what carousel to go to so I went to the most crowded one but I didn't find my luggage there. I went to the other ones and as I was walking up to one I saw a security or luggage claim agent rolling my suitcase then left it in the middle of the floor and walked off. I chalked it up that he saw it matched my carry-on but he didn't say anything to me. I wasn't sure where else to go to next. I went to the service desk and no one was there. I waited for 5 minutes, no one appeared. I just decided to walk out a big exit gate and then I was in the main terminal where it was like night and day. On departure day, there was some confusion where to go. I started on the main floor in one terminal then went to the 2nd fl. just have to go to the main fl. again to check my suitcase and get my boarding pass. I didn't see any ticket machines. There was no real clear directions. I found that I had to go to the 3rd fl to security. The security area was jammed with people and noise. I accidentally put my boarding pass in the bin with my cardigan. The security guy wouldn't let me get it out. It wasn't there when I went to get the bin. Good thing another security guy found it. To get to my gate I had to pass through a perfume shop where sales ladies were offering sample spritzes. This is not safe for those with scent and chemical allergies. There wasn't any seating areas I could see. But I had to board right away, anyways.",4.0

They came back fine but the other bag which literally just contained clothes went into a separate queue in which I waited 30/45 minutes to be told that my bag didn’t scan when it went through the scanner so it needs to pass through again. My bag went through the scanner and returned fine just like my other bag. If my bag had been scanned in the X-ray machine in the first place it would have taken out 30/45 minutes of my wait.

Had to beg to skip the line as we wouldn't have managed to 1) check in 2) drop luggage 3) clear security and 4) get to gate. - Understaffed security at the Assistance Lane we were forced to use with overzealous security staff. - Far too many shops (most of which are cheap and tacky, not like Munich or Zurich), with too little gate space and seating resulting in queues stretching out into corridors (e.g. Gate 23) - The childrens play area consists of little more than a soft mat with five building blocks in a dark space. Not nice. No wonder there were no other children/parents there. - Long immigration queues, which we were fortunately able to bypass with our infant, but spare a moment of thought for visitors and those returning from deserved holidays facing an hour queuing. - Nearly the whole Terminal has low ceilings, no windows, is dark and dingy and is such a depressing place to start or end a holiday.",2.0

I fully appreciate the need for enhanced security measures, however the other international airports I fly through do not seem to have the same issues. It’s also really disappointing that you need a £1.00 coin or €2.00 coin for a luggage trolley when you arrive.

227,"Organized Chaos is how I would describe the security area at Manchester. Totally overwhelmed and understaffed. I’ve travelled through Manchester many many times and never seen such a shambles. We were warned that a manual search would take at least an hour, so were careful to comply with all regulations, to the point where my wife had taken off all her jewelry and put it in a plastic bag. We asked the assistant what would be the correct place to store it for the check. He said please put it in your hand luggage. So we were surprised when our bag was kicked off the line, along with many, many others. After an hour, our turn came to be examined, and what had caused the bag to be rejected? The jewellery! A lady stood to the side of me was distraught, and finished up pleading with someone, as her flight left in twenty minutes. When a man who appeared to be the supervisor came to her, he just said you should have told me. She’d been trying to get someone’s attention for twenty minutes! We were lucky, we got to the airport two and a quarter hours before our flight was due to leave, and just got to the gate in time. Don’t get me wrong the security men were doing the best they could under the circumstances, but there simply was not enough of them. However, on the bright side, I can get to Liverpool Airport just as quickly as Manchester, so maybe Easyjet have lost a couple of customers, and Ryanair (yuk) picked some up.

228,"Having travelled extensively, from using airports described as being mature, well furbished to basic third world through to airports in conflict zones, I can honestly say that Manchester Airport is the worst airport that I have travelled through in the past forty years. The airport is untidy, dirty, and its only purpose appears to make money from its customers in any fashion possible – from drop off charges, inadequate parking facilities and excessive charging, though to baggage trolley charging and overpriced unappealing food and beverage facilities, not to mention the over the top concession stands. The worst aspect is security, which prides itself in kittling customers, providing competing advice from staff, joyous patting down of customers, to the ninth degree, through to the rummaging through of rejected hand luggage. This was only too practised on my wife, who was patted down repeatedly, despite only wearing a shift dress, and underwear, and advising of an arterial shunt, who was advised during her patting down to raise her dress so that her legs could be seen – despite a fellow security colleague advising her to stop the pat down. Her hand luggage was not inspected for he plethora of lifesaving drugs, but for a turned off phone, which was left in the hand luggage on the advice of the security personnel. Advice is to avoid this airport at all costs, even if it entails a longer journey, as your health will be put in danger of using this airport.",1.0

If the airport management think this is the best way to treat paying passengers than great you've made it, you got yourselves to the very top of the worst airport ever title, number one for, poor attitude, rudeness, inept staff, abrupt staff, disrespectful staff, you must be very proud of them all. Navigating through a complex airport with confused passengers doesn't make for good reading little or no help, if passengers have to continually ask which way to go than something must be missing, clear signage and helpful guides may be a good place to start.

231,"I had the misfortune to depart from Manchester airport twice in June, once to Finland and once to Germany. Both departures featured very long queues to get through security. Staff manning the queues were often arrogant and unfriendly and seemed to enjoy barking orders at the hapless customers. There were not enough scanners in operation which added to the queues. And there seems to have been an upsurge in items failing to pass the scanner test and customers having to wait to be interrogated as to what they have packed. I waited for half an hour on the Finland flight to be told that my empty metal drink flask should have had its top unscrewed as the X-Ray couldn't see inside. I'd never travelled with this flask before and it had not occurred to me that this might be an issue. I can see why they challenged me, but the member of staff involved seemed to delight in telling me off like a naughty schoolboy. The next departure, to Germany, was via the underground ""Departures B"" hall. This is horrible. It is dark, low ceilinged, hot, again with long queues and officious staff. Having watched the TV drama ""Years and Years"" recently it feels like Manchester airport is auditioning for a role as the prototype ""Police State"". Lots to put right guys!

The airport quite clearly cannot handle the number of passengers 11 flights landed within an hour and not one would have more than 200 passengers on board. I can see that before I left Palma, why cant they plan themselves. Build more gates, employ more personnel, God knows they rip us off for so much of our hard earned money.

234,"Boarding pass issued by Jet2 Flight LS810 5th July Malaga to Manchester. Our experience as a couple who are reasonably mobile but with some health issues was most acceptable until our return. The distance from Terminal 2 to the baggage reclaim is substantial with hand luggage but just manageable. The distance and route to the car park floor 0 to be collected by taxi whilst carrying heavy luggage was the last straw. There is no indication at baggage reclaim of the distance yet to be negotiated and the volume of people using this entrance/exit makes this part of the journey whilst handling heavy luggage extremely arduous. There are no 'obvious' staff enroute from whom one may request assistance and whilst we did manage the walk it resulted in my wife not feeling very well at all (since recovered). Surely during the planning phase of the overall work being undertaken someone must have realised or noted or completed a suitable and sufficient 'Risk assessment' to account for the many passengers that are elderley and may suffer from health and some mobility issues, some not always apparent, and note that the overall distance with luggage is pretty unacceptable.

235,"I travel through many international airports and I can quite honestly say that Manchester Airport is the very worst that I have to use. It is also unfortunately my nearest international airport and so have to use it. By far the worst aspect is passing through security - and it doesn't matter which terminal you use - they are as bad as each other. I overheard one traveller describing it as a ""kettling"" experience, with rude staff shouting at travellers and treating them like ""criminal cattle"". Also, it seems that all passengers now have to go through the body scanners rather than the metal detector gates used by virtually all other airports (including Heathrow by the way.) No idea why, but the last 5 times I have been through these I have been subjected to pat down searches, shoes removed and scanned separately etc. etc. I am a 60+ plus ""professional"", I am a seasoned traveller, never wear anything metal when I go through but am still stopped and searched. Ridiculous. Once through, if your carry on luggage is not rejected and searched, the place is crowded, worn out and just plain unpleasant. Arriving from Heathrow to terminal 3 today, the baggage reclaim and arrivals areas were dull, dirty and opressive. I was being met by a private taxi. There were no directions from the arrivals area to the pick up point - which turned out to be level 2 of the multi story car park and the only reason I found this out was by walking into the middle of the road and asking one of the ""drop off"" marshalls. The taxi picked me up, had to find somewhere to park and the driver had to walk back to a pay point so that he could pay the exit fee, while I waited in the taxi. Ridiculous! I would like to take weekend European city breaks but it takes a couple of days to recover from the trauma of Manchester airport, so quite honestly, I don't bother.

The airport is packed with people, again processed in a small space. It has totally changed from the 'good old days', I will do everything I can to avoid this Airport in the future.

As we walked from the plane one of the moving walkways was out of action - that's usually the case I find. Then there are always lots of steps to negotiate.

241,"I live near this airport and find it embarrassing having to apologise to people for their experience of it. It is hard to know were to start: Arrival and drop off (even at the station) is not only a rip off but incredibly inefficient. It can take 20 minutes of jostling to get out of the arrivals car park because it is so badly designed and chaotic. Independent taxi drivers in the area despair. The machines are often out of order so you also have to queue at the ones that are to be ripped off. The airport is a frequent source of delays on return flights at other airports due to IT breakdowns (last weekend), work to rule sessions, other IR disputes etc. On my most recent flight last weekend the pilot announced that they forgot to send a bus to take us to the terminal (on another occasion the stairs to disembark the passengers). A genuine customer service ethos in my experience is quite thin on the ground and you frequently encounter unnecessarily officious personnel. I did last weekend at baggage check on departure and border control on arrival. If you are planning on using the airport lounges, you need to book (and pay). On most visits I have not got into either of the terminal 1 lounges with a lounge pass card. They will put you are on a list but can give you no indication of when you might get a slot.

We're talking about the second airport in the UK, is unacceptable how bad everything is. Horrible quality of shops, the most outdated security control, the rudest staff ever, full of incompetent divas who clearly do not understand what traveling means. They force you to fit all the liquids in a bag which clearly is sampler than any other provided worldwide, ever when international regulations says you're allowed to bring up to 1L as long as it on recipients under 100ML, not at the Manchester Airport, they want to be special, plus they want to argue with you and terrorise with the fact you might lose your flight. It's painful just to think how everything is so bad. But clearly the staff is the worst, if the airport is simple, you get over it, but making the whole process traumatic and a pain before flying, is an absurd. I would love to have the option of not flying there, but unfortunately is impossible, as KLM doesn't fly to Liverpool anymore. Brits are not the greatest on service, we get that, but follow the international rules, even in New York is easier, and everyone knows how neurotic and obsessed North Americans are, but the Brits want to feel special and be different.

247,"I have flown three times between Aberdeen and Manchester over the past five weeks for cancer treatment. On arrival I have walked to the airport railway station. Almost all of the escalators and moving walkways between T3 and the station have been out of operation for more than a month. This is simply ludicrous. The signs about 'essential maintenance' and similar are telling blatant lies. Flying from T3 has been an ordeal every time. The place is always overcrowded, with few places to sit; the food on offer from most of the outlets is substandard; the toilets have such narrow access that people can't pass each other and folk with wet hands can't reach the hot-air (in some cases cold-air) dryers because of the stream of incoming passengers. The 'free WiFi' doesn't connect to the internet, and the airport seems to have excluded the usual wifi service providers (e.g. O2 etc.) from its premises. Water on sale is ridiculously expensive and there are no simple water fountains provided for passengers to assuage their thirst. This is a crucial point: we are not permitted to carry our own water to airside through security, so any airport should be obliged to provide readily accessible drinking water in the departure lounge; otherwise they're just running an extortion racket in consort with the airport shops. Security at Manchester is consistently of a more stringent order than anywhere else in the UK. They are clearly determined never to have a terrorist pass through their gates, but they seem not to appreciate the effect the associated hostile attitude of security staff has on the 99.999% of innocent people who have merely dared to travel by air. Today the T3 security team reached a new peak of objectionability for me personally. I have had surgery that obliges me to wear a colostomy pouch. The new body scanners at Manchester Airport picked this up (they can also apparently detect even a linen handkerchief in a pocket). I was taken to a private room where I was obliged to show my colostomy to the security staff, to lift the colostomy pouch so the staff could see underneath, then to have my hands swabbed for residues of explosive. I would have been delighted for the staff to sample the contents of my colostomy pouch by mouth, but that was not something they volunteered to do. The bottom line is that Manchester is an airport from hell, and I resent ever being obliged to travel from it. With the new body-scanning machines poised to replace the old metal detectors, the staff are going to be working overtime embarrassing innocent customers with false-positive scans.",1.0

Our friend got it wrong and drove through the drop off area to pick up at T3, literally no more than 60 seconds from entering to the pay barrier, £100 fine dropped to £25 upon arguing. Absolute disgrace, providing a service? I think not. Never again. I wonder what the likes of Tui and Thomas Cook think of putting off their customers from flying.",2.0
249,The new drop off facilities Jetparks 1. This is a good idea and the car park is easy to find. Today however this is where it ended. Nobody told us that those dropping off are not supposed to accompany their travellers to the terminal. The bus on the way back was painfully slow 20 minutes mainly because the driver stopped for 6 minutes at T2. When he dropped us he accused both my daughter and me of misusing the facilities and that we would be fined £100. When we protested he told me not to shout and then proceeded to shout at us. We did overshoot the hour because of this driver being so slow and they tried to charge us £25 for 8 minutes. Only the fact that the card readers did not work meant that we did not pay. A good idea poorly executed. It's an absolute disgrace in any event that the charge to drop off at the terminal is £5 for 10 minutes. We saw lots of people parked dangerously on roundabouts dropping off. This is human nature. We tried to do It right to see my daughter off on her travels and were met with incompetence and rudeness.,3.0
250,"In the past we have always enjoyed being at the airport as we felt it was part of our holiday experience. We usually get to the airport by car but this time we decided to travel by train which was fine. We arrived at 7.30 in the evening. On entering Terminal 2 we needed to visit the WC. I can only say how disgusted I was at the poor standard of cleanliness. In one of the toilets a person had obviously been sick and in one of the wash hand basins there was faeces. Unacceptable. The check-in was a breeze as was security, probably because it was in the evening although we’ve never had any problems with these in our previous visits. The next disappointment was when we entered the shopping area before the duty free shop. All the shops and eateries were shut even though it was just on 8pm. So the few bits of shopping I wanted to get, I was unable to do. Going through the duty free shop into the gate area we found only 3 shops left open. We had planned to have a bite to eat, very little choice and extremely expensive. We could not believe the state the main eating areas were in. Food packaging from Burger King were left on tables with used glasses not cleared away and there was used plates still with food on, gathering flies, from the restaurant Spinning Jenny. I’m not talking about an odd table but lots of them. I can’t believe how members of staff just kept walking past without a glance. Just because we were flying later in the day doesn’t mean we have to be surrounded by other people’s rubbish. On a positive note our flight handlers were very helpful to the travellers, especially those who had young children and the less able. This is the first time I have ever felt strongly enough to bother making a review but felt the standard of what should be expected wasn’t met.",2.0
251,Extremely poor security queue times and rude staff. There is no consistent message each time you come to the airport. Poor choice of food outlets that are overpriced and offer a very poor service.,2.0
252,"Let's face it Manchester Airport is 3rd World but on this occasion I was surprised by its efficiency. Flew out on 27th May on EK020 from Gate 12 in T1. Surprised to find check-in open at 17.15hrs so by 17.35hrs I was checked in and believe it or not through the infamous security screening. Now this came as a total surprise and not only that there were no long queues but the personnel were civil and polite - and no I did not pay for ""fast lanes"" - but as an experienced longhaul traveller I know what is and is not allowed through screening. Most importantly this time my passport was not x-rayed! After this MAN showed it's true form - a food and beverage area that reminded me of a suburban shopping centre food court, woeful inadequate seating with a general scruffy and dirty look to the whole place - lots of litter in the seating areas in the food court. I even felt sorry for the ""budget airline"" passengers boarding and disembarking via mobile stairs in the rain. Believe it or not I would recommend MAN but only because it offers ""1 stop"" flights to & from Australia thereby avoiding LHR or LGW and as I visit family in the North West it saves driving time.",3.0
253,"Jet Park 1 Free Drop Off + chaotic airport congestion. A friend asked me to please do a favour and take her 15-year-old daughter to the airport. She was returning home to Germany after an exchange term. I phoned Manchester airport and asked what the best ""Drop Off"" option was, as I did not want too just ""drop off"" an underage child. I wanted to see her safely check in and go through security - as any responsible and caring adult would do. I was given helpful advice and it was suggested that Jet Park 1 was the best option as it allowed me 60 mins to escort the child to terminal 1 departures and return to the car. I did not want to pay the extortionate fee of £7 for doing a favour after having driven from Preston to Windermere to fetch the child and then on to Manchester Airport before returning to Preston. Her flight was at 1800 and we arrived at Jet Park 1 at 1520. Soon after we got out, the bus arrived, but we waited another 10 minutes as the bus drivers were changing and the new driver diligently inspected the bus for any faults before letting us board. We were finally dropped off at Terminal 1 arrivals. I helped the child with her two big suitcases - but it was really slow going as there were a lot of people arriving off a flight and it was congested. When we finally got to the lifts for Terminal 1 departures A, the queues were deep. We waited for another 5 to 10 minutes. The bags were heavy, and there was no way we could manage up the stairs with two very heavy bags. When we finally got to Lufthansa check-in, the process was quick as her father had used miles to get a business class upgrade. Once checked in, I escorted her to security and waved her off. The whole time I was desperate for the loo. I looked at my watch to see if I had time to go to the toilets before navigating back to the bus stop for Jet Park 1. I only had 15 minutes to get back to my car! So I did not go to the toilet and went as fast as I could back to the bus stop at Terminal 1 arrivals (despite having had foot surgery 6 weeks ago). The bus arrived relatively promptly but I got back to the car 5 minutes past the hour and was presented with a £25 fee! I am aware that there is no grace period for free drop off and I agree that there should not be a grace period for free drop off (to stop people abusing it). But my point is, that the system does not work. The client is set up to fail because it is impossible to get from Jet Park 1 to Terminal 1 departures and back, in 60 mins or less. This is an unreasonable expectation and fuels my suspicion that the operator is just out to make money and not actually there to provide a service. Furthermore, the man I spoke to on the intercom while trying to exit the car park, told me it was my fault I arrived back late to the car and hung up on me! But for him to effectively accuse me of wasting time and therefore being late back to the car when I had gone as fast as possible, was unacceptable and rude! I am 46 years old and except for a sore post-op foot, am a fit triathlete. How can you expect a 70yr old to do the same Jet Park 1 Terminal 1 round trip in under an hour if I cannot? I think the time limit should be increased from 60 mins to 80mins.",1.0
254,"Very bad experience. 1) for departure car parked in multi stored building, level 10. 1a) There is no trolley on that floor. 1b) There is no sign to find out the lift. 1c) I am not able to find a pedestrian way to use heavy luggage and pushchair. 2) Identified the lift with difficulty. There are two departure symbols. Departure A (level 5) and departure B (level 0) there is no indication on where I need to go. Without having a trolley, I went to level 5 and searched, then only could I identity I was on the wrong floor. Very poor on giving the right direction.",2.0
255,"Getting through the dreaded security cave at T2 is a nightmare. Got shouted at immediately on entering, then, when I got chippy back (yes, I know!), was called over to be told to 'lose the attitude' (like I was back at school) or I wouldn't be let in. As anyone familiar with the place will know, being told to 'lose the attitude' by a member of MAN security team would be one of the comic highlights of the year, if the consequences weren't potentially serious. I should point out it tends to be 'supervisor' types who are the problem - the people actually doing the work seem OK. It did spoil the start of our holiday though, so I would advise that if you come here, remember not to speak to them the same way they speak to you- they don't like it. Anyway, after a bit more being shouted at we finally got through. Then on being called to the gate, we discovered that we were in the new pier, which is about a quarter mile walk down echoing empty corridors to get to. On the way, we passed a number of travelators which were being 'commissioned' (or 'built', as anyone else would put it). Fortunately, a nice lady offered my wife (who has mobility problems) a wheelchair ride. This is how it is at Manchester - some of the people are great, others not. Then, at the gate, we were called through for boarding, only to get stuck in the boarding tube because the plane wasn't ready for us after all. This is another MAN speciality, with a new addition this time of the lights going off and being blasted with hot air from a fan. On coming back from hols, the passport readers refused to work - mine recognised me at the second go, but my wife had to go into a massive queue. Fortunately, we still got to baggage in plenty of time before our cases. I hope that the new building works will be an improvement, rather than 'more of the same'. We may not be around to see it, as we will be looking at alternative airports in future. Its got to be a bad score, though it is probably unfair on the good ones who do try.",2.0

I often sleep at airports and never has a situation where they didn’t want to let me in around the gates early, here they have the rule of 6h ahead and it would be ok if there was anywhere normal to wait, instead a couple of noisy and dirty chairs.

263,"I had the misfortune to travel through Manchester Airport two weeks in a row. Never again! Last week I arrived from Geneva and missed my train from Man airport as the queue at passport control was at least 1km long. For the return flight, security held me up at least 20 minutes over a couple of small items that they insisted were ""gels"" when they patently were not. eg jar of solid eyeliner, lipstick, lip balm and my toothpaste was confiscated as not fitting in the liquids bag when these other items were added. Given this experience, I was determined that my transit through Manchester Airport security this week should go smoothly. I purchased a fast track passport control ticket for £5, and avoided the queues. However, I had to re-enter domestic security for a flight to Glasgow. The bottle of perfume purchased in Geneva duty free was not allowed, even though it was in a sealed duty free bag. Had to be opened, unpackaged and placed in the liquids bag. Emerging from security, I found standing room only in a noisy, filthy perfumy food hall. Much worse was to come on the return flight. My handbag was hauled out for inspection. After a 10 minute wait, it was swiped and found suspect. Most of the contents were taken out, not in front of me, but well behind the counter. Personal items, including a precious scarf that I did not want to come in contact with the filthy grey trays, were unceremoniously dumped. Two purses, one with swiss money, one with sterling were laid out and exposed, my phone was confiscated while I was questioned, as to profession, purpose of visit to Glasgow (mother in hospital) and what I had done, what medication I take (none), what medication my hospitalised mother is taking (no idea). I was body searched a second time and refused my coat, though it was cold. I was delayed for 45 minutes while phone calls were made, no information given until release... suspected traces of explosive found within handbag (absurd!) Running for the gate was a nightmare. A huge crowded duty free shopping zone has been deliberately designed to delay passengers. A consumerist treadmill with no short cut to the gates. Fortunately, flight was delayed, but there was nowhere to sit down before gate number shown. Ordered scrambled eggs, in noisy, filthy bar but the order got scrambled... ended up with the wrong dish having waited more than 15 minutes. The only positive point was the pretty little rose garden off the walkway between terminals 3 and 1. For the rest, the moving walkways were out of order, as they had been the previous week, and the general impression is of a dirty grossly overcrowded environment. Though the staff are pleasant and helpful, management is evidently poor, the whole experience was extremely stressful, and I felt ripped off and abused. Needless to say, my next trip to Glasgow will be through Amsterdam, no matter what price the ticket.",1.0
264,"What an absolute disgrace Terminal 1. Just returned from a fortnights holiday in the Far East flying with Emirates airlines from Terminal 1 Manchester Airport. Our daughter dropped us off at Terminal 1 and then had the privilege of paying Three pounds to exit the barriers. Check-in and Security I can only describe as Chaos. (Please smile staff it costs nothing.) Bangkok, Siem Reap, Phuket and Dubai airports were all absolutely immaculately kept. No Litter, toilets immaculate, staff all very friendly, check-in and security no hassle whatsoever. On landing at Terminal 1 the only positive I can possibly give was passport control which proceeded quite quickly. Apart from that another horrible experience. Toilets dirty, staff sullen and a total embarrassment to be quite honest. I spoke to a lady from Australia at luggage pickup who's exact words were "" Have I landed in a Third World Country"". I will say no more. Then off course the Four pounds our daughter had to pay just to exit the pickup at the car park for a two minute stay.",1.0
265,"Manchester Airport terminal 3 is probably the most infuriating and annoying airport I’ve ever had the misfortune to travel through. It started with Ryanair’s self check in bag drop. With only one member of staff to oversee hundreds of people self checking in their bags. It takes a long time. There are no staffed bag drop lanes only self drop. Then you move on to the security check area to get airside. Long queues of people shuffle through tight and congested lines. People continually bumping into each other. The lay out of the security area seems to have a counter intuitive layout. Lots of back and forth, lots of irritated people bumping into each other. Then probably your bag will be siphoned off to an area that requires a further additional security check. Another long wait while people scramble in front of each other as their bags are called to be searched. I over heard another passenger describe it as total carnage. If you are unlucky enough, like we were, to get a false positive reaction to the swab test on the bags (a test for explosives), you will then be further subjected to questioning and more swab tests, scanner machines and a physical search. After all this, if of course, they let you go, you can then enter the airside area. We were shaken after our intensive security experience. We then decided to buy a bottle of water in boots. There were 2 tills open and a queue that snaked all around the shop and out of the front. There must have been at least 70 or 80 people in the queue. It took over 25mins for me to purchase 2 bottles of water. When we finally managed to get a seat with our water, I looked at the time. We had arrived at Ryanair bag drop at 5.30pm and when we sat airside, it was 7.30pm. 2hrs!!! I’ll say that again.....2hrs!!! Good job we left ourselves with time to spare. We have had previous experience of Manchester Airport. The terminal is over crowded with very little seating in small areas. It is not very clean. All areas where you buy things, ie. bars and shops and food seem to be understaffed and overcrowded. I have been flying for over 30 years, many times a year in lots of countries. It would be fair to say that I am an experienced and frequent flier. But never have I experienced the disorganisation and general unease of flying through Manchester terminal 3. I will alter my itinerary in the future to avoid using this airport.",1.0
266,"After checking in we decided to get a cup of tea in one of the cafes in terminal one.

We bought a book at WH Smith and whilst on holiday discovered we were overcharged by £1.00. The barcode was obviously set up incorrectly as I complained to another WH Smith store on our return and received a refund. The travelator was also broken. In contrast Palma airport was immaculately clean with a working travelator and hot water and hot air dryers in the restroom.

267,Having travelled for decades through Manchester Airport I truly believe it has become the worst airport experience in Europe if not the world. I recently had to endure the the usual 50 to 60per cent of cabin bags pushed aside for rechecking. I really believe the x-ray operators were being trained as they were unable to identify possible threats or not. There was a massive queue of people waiting for at least another 20 minutes or more to retrieve their possessions from the trays. It was pandemodium. I can't imagine what the situation would have been like if it had been a half term ect. I don't think I am alone in believing that MAG is 100% concentrating on increasing profits (as the recent drop off and pick up charges would indicate) rather than deliver a security experience that takes into account the wellbeing of their customers. It needs to train it's security staff some basic customer service as this certainly not evident as per usual.,1.0

269,Without a doubt the worst airport in Europe. I am a regular flyer and Manchester airport just gets worse every year.

If you are thinking of booking fast track don't bother as there is no difference than the normal service.which is poor at best.

270,"Both leaving and arriving at Manchester airport are now nothing but an irritating hassle, poor service and a complete and utter rip off. Despite living less than 10 miles away public transport would take over an hour and a half therefore realistically for an early departure and late evening arrival I needed to travel by car/taxi. This week my husband dropped me at terminal 3. He pulled in at drop off. I jumped out of the car and picked up my bag. He drove away and we had to pay £3 for the privilege. Arriving back we flew into the newly opened part of terminal 2. There was no indication that it was a 10 minute walk to passport control. Fine for me as a fit and healthy traveller but I don’t believe my older mother or others with even minor mobility issues would have found this easy. That is unacceptable. Having cleared passport control and customs I then found I had to walk another 300+ m to a pick up zone. It wasn’t until I found myself inside a car park that it became clear that the pick up zone was in there. I am very happy to travel the world but late at night, walking down long and mostly deserted areas I did not feel very safe and was not confident I would easily be able to locate my husband. He found his way to the zone and within less than a minute we were on our way out. Yes you guessed it there was a £4 charge for the privilege of a totally poor experience.

The security process seems dis-organised and should be re-aligned to operate in a way that all other airports do. The queuing system to load trays onto the scanning belt led to people bumping, tripping and having to push past each other: at least 1/3 of all trays were rejected resulting in a large crowd of people trying to get their belongings. When a security person selected my tray I identified myself. I was then told that I was too early (true my flight was a few hours later) and to my extreme distress I was told that my tray would be sent to the back of the queue. My jacket was within my reach, but he took it away and physically placed it on a bench behind all the others. I had to wait another 20 mins to see it again - and it passed OK. This was a vindictive act, that seems to fit the culture encouraged in this terrible environment. Manchester Airport Management Team - you should be ashamed.",1.0

It's the busiest terminal which is literally the smallest, everyone sits on the floor as there is nowhere to sit due to not having enough seating. There are no smoking facilities in this terminal, so if you smoke you need to judge coming through security, which flutters between mega security checks to as lax as getting on a bus, then grumpy security staff. To judging if your plane is going to be late, and taking that into consideration in a sixth sense type of way. I'm a frequent flyer and really pains me when I have to come through Manchester T3, there is food debris everywhere, it's really a surprise that rats are not running around, I guess due to all the people being crammed in to a igly piggly airport terminal is what keeps them away! Also do note, when they say the airport is more expensive, well I have been to over 200 airports in my time, and Manchester is on a par with Iceland in regards to prices!

274,"After a 4 hour flight delay, I would not have expected a further 1 hour to wait for bags etc to come off the plane and to get to the baggage reclaim area. The airport knew we were coming, yet there seems to be little planning in terms of staffing. It’s not OK to have to wait nearly 50% of your flight time, especially at 3.25 am. After all the investment in to the airport, this is an area that I have rarely seen improve over the last 10/20 years. If I can land in another large overseas airport and bags hit the carousel within 15 minutes at peak travelling times, how come Manchester can not do this off peak. Literally stood with c 1,500 people in the early hours of this morning from multiple flights coming in and it literally sounded like there were 2 people taking bags off the landing planes. Where’s the urgency. Customer choice will inevitably be the downfall of this airport, which is a shame given the previous investment and current ongoing investment. Worst still, i’m paying for this service through my holiday cost.

Not sure why Manchester airport decided to be more strict on security than any other airport. I went through CDG with everything fine and then in Manchester they were pulling bags for the smallest “liquids” ie mascara. I saw the security staff pulling out and throwing away really nice bottles of wine / liquor purchased at the duty free store in CDG. Then we were told to go to an area where we should wait for a bus and if we “didn’t see one to use the phone to call for one in 15 minutes”? Then we were bussed again to terminal 2 where we were greeted by a weird confusing area under construction and tried to go through the maze to finally find the gate. A literal nightmare.

I was stood there waiting to put my bag in a tray when we found a Stanley knife on the floor - this had clearly been dropped by someone in front of this. I  alerted the security officer who didn't seem phased one bit that there was a knife on the floor. Not only that but the two officers stood by the xray machine made a joke about it saying ""told you not to bring a knife to work"". In the current climate regarding terrorism this was  disgusting and disgraceful of the Manchester security staff to act in this manner.  If that wasn't bad enough, we were also being asked to take our shoes off and had we not have spotted the knife this could have resulted in serious injury to someone. I will never fly from Manchester again and hope this makes others think twice about flying from this airport",1.0
277,"Without doubt the worst airport I have ever been to. (Around 40-50 total). The security check is impossible to find without asking directions. Turns out it is in a basement (seems like an old parking garage) with nowhere close to sufficient space for the security equipment, queues. To make things even worse they developed a system like no other for how to send bags through the scanners. So instead of lining up and dropping bags, jackets etc for the belt you line up 5 at the time and hope that this will run systematically. It seemed not to. Also their equipment seems old, which is backed up by just how many bags and jackets that were subject to further review. The further review was administrated by 3 persons which led to an enormous added wait. (By comparison they had around 20 people doing the jobs of signs by telling what you can and cant bring in the cabin baggage). Lastly they only know the gate number for the next 4 planes so everyone had to wait in the overcrowded central lounge instead of using the area around the gates. Truth be told, a process manager would make billions helping them.",1.0

We traveled with Jet2 and due to poor signs we took the long way round to checkin. From past experience of security we paid for the express lane. Not worth the money! All it does is skips a few rows of the snake queue. Least I expect is to give priority all through security even if your bag is rejected. Mine was and treated me to 30 mins wait whilst watching security staff talking to customers with no respect. Terrible! Seating areas are uncomfortable unless your in a bar or restaurant paying over the odds for food and drinks. The toilets are shocking. Well overdue remodelling and standard of hygiene is terrible. Gates are problematic with stairs in metal clad stairwells with no ventilation which in the height of summer (past experience) lead to an uncomfortable time queuing on the stairs waiting to be called to the aircraft. A problem if you have a slight mobility issue. On our return from Rome where the airport is a much more pleasant experience, we were met by a long walk to the baggage reclaim area and then over 20 minutes delay before the first bags came off. All in all compared to other airports around the Europe, a very unpleasant experience that always leaves me stressed.",2.0

They have now managed to make its customers feel abused, disliked, ignored, despised and generally an intrusion that has to be punished for wanting to enter their territory. Arriving at the airport is a nightmare, whichever terminal you want. Confusing, no signposting, incorrect information, and when you finally find an escape or entry route they make sure your car is damaged by the stupidly narrow barriers that will cut your wheels off on your way through. There is nowhere to pick passengers up quickly because today I found that the pickup point opposite T3 entrance has now been blocked, sending cars up 2 floors, leaving stranded passengers to find a way of meeting their relatives/friends picking them up. All the staff around the car parks are rude, unhelpful and just stand around smoking cigarettes as though they owned the place. There is nothing good about this airport any more and it has just become a negative place to be at all levels. It is a national disgrace.",1.0
283,"The Airport is ok once you pass the dreadful security. During the queuing time you have a couple of staff members yelling instructions about fluids, laptops, phones etc. (what a nasty experience) I was quite relieved that the security queues were not much different to most airports that I have used recently about 20 minutes (Man is 7th Airport I have used this year). The major catch is that the scanning machines rejected about 95% of the Bags. Mine was rejected due to a travel adapter. This just pushes the waiting queues to the other side of the security and nearly everybody has to wait for their bag to be manually checked. I had to wait for nearly an hour before my hand luggage was due. As mentioned a travel adapter was the problem, all other airports I have used this year this was never an issue. Then you just get a stroppy inspector asking the usual question like have you packed yourself etc. Overall there were 3 staff members manually checking and swabbing the hand luggage. It looks like Manchester T1 are using very different scanning machines as all other world airports, as I have used this Airport several times over the years and the security is always the worst experience. My bag gets rejected every time, even a pen will get your bag rejected. The security area in T1 is also the most depressing room you could ever imagine, dirty with dull lighting, broken floor tiles and overall extremely dated with know it all staff members",4.0
284,"This is one the most backward airports in the UK, WiFi sucks, there is not enough seating and lack of display screens for flights. The cleaners need firing and re-employing with people who actually clean, full bins, no smoking area, even Leeds Bradford airport has a smoking part and apparently Manchester is meant to be a bigger airport. The biggest problem is the staff, all seem to be grumpy!",2.0
285,"Ten years ago I used to extol the benefits of Manchester airport - it was the best in the UK (I travel a lot). The last few years have left it as one of the worst in the UK. Security, facilities, overcrowding, catering for solo travelers etc are all abysmal. My current favourite is Birmingham, busy but spacious, expanded food seating etc. Manchester has really dropped the ball in my opinion.",3.0
286,"We moved to Manchester from Perth, Australia, expecting an upgrade in the quality of our travel. Should have done some research before choosing this city as a base to explore Europe! Have now been in and out of countless airports in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia and I can't think of a worse airport around the world. Hygiene and cleanliness are terrible, security screens are unfriendly and a mess, and general amenities are a poor. You're always walking around the place the travelators rarely work, and the elevator system to take you between the station and the terminal levels is a joke. Most recently got off a flight from Qatar, and only had three immigration desks processing non-UK visitors (plus all of the people in wheelchairs and cabin crew). Time to knock it down and start again.",1.0
287,"Definitely the worst airport in the world. Congested most of the time - doubt it meets HSE standards. Frequent delays due to understaffing - example people in wheelchairs waiting to get off the plane have to wait significant amount of time to get off because not enough manpower is available to help them. Then further delays. They put that there are plans to refurbish the airport but it is a long way from completion. If you go to a third world country, the airports are so much better.",1.0
288,"Every time I fly via Manchester Airport my luggage gets pulled out at security, and every time for something different which is not actually a violation to carry. I paid a bit extra for Fast Track this last time because I know it takes so long, and it still ended up taking over an hour. It seemed that the 'good' luggage was about 1 in 10 of 'bad' luggage - with even people who were not getting pulled over still having to wait ages because of the backlog through the scanner. I fly quite often and never have this problem at any other airport both at home and abroad. I pack very carefully but it seems no matter how careful I am, I can't win at this airport. I very very carefully made sure that no fluids were left out of my 'fluid bag', and I followed all other guidelines. But I got pulled over for tablets in a small glass bottle, an asthma inhaler (which last time I got told wasn't a fluid and I didn't want to take up valuable room in my little fluid bag), oh and a small mirror with a light. I got speaking with the guy who was checking my bags and said that I only ever had these issues in Manchester. I was glad they were been vigilant but vigilance had to be tempered with a good dose of pragmatism as basically they were checking 8 out of 10 people going thru. He was actually a pleasant young man and he sort of agreed with me. He said he used to work at a different airport and that he knew it was a lot different in Manchester. I actually felt sorry for him and his colleagues, they have an awfully difficult job to do, people shouting at them and getting agitated at missing planes, plus their work space is ridiculously cramped yet there are acres of space given over to retail once you finally get through the hallowed doors of security. If security is so important (which we all know it is) - give them the space, the environment and the tools to do it quickly and efficiently so that everyone has a much better experience.",2.0
289,"We arrived in plenty of time to check in and get through security. Check in took an hour. Online check in and priority boarding made absolutely no difference whatsoever to queue length. Then security - well, what an absolute joke! Patronising, arrogant staff on power trips need to be given proper training on how to deal with their customers. Checking bags and asking stupid questions with clearly obvious answers and deliberately wasting your time. We (my elderly mother and I) literally had 30 mins to grab a drink before boarding. We had been up since 3am and driven 2 hours to ensure we had some time to chill out in have a wonder around duty free before boarding our flight. My mum was literally shaking with stress when we got to the boarding gate. Disgusting behaviour by ‘security’ and unnecessarily long check in make me want to fly from elsewhere in future.",1.0
290,"Queuing times were abominable on 9 April in T3. The staff member I spoke to said the queues were because passengers were not heeding the advice to have items ready for screening. But it was obvious that there simply were not enough screening channels open for the volume of passengers. The screening process itself got no better. The x-ray scan showed up four areas of concern on my body, which resulted in a very thorough frisking. I don't have any qualms or objections to the need for the level of security screening required, but for some reason, the experience in Manchester Airport always seems to feel more invasive and unpleasant. By comparison, the screening in Dublin on my return was no less thorough, but the experience felt a world away from Manchester, less invasive, less unpleasant and more humane. The airport environment does nothing to redeem the experience, if I could avoid travelling through Manchester Airport I would.",2.0
291,On the 10th April 2019 my sister and I travelled to Malta to celebrate her 50th. We arrived at Manchester Airport to check in to what looked like a cattle market. Staff were rude and unfriendly and we were shunted from queue to queue with only pointing from staff as to where we should be. After placing her belongings in the trays for inspection the security officer demanded that she pick up the tray and pass it over to him. He could clearly see she was on a walking stick and had mobility problems. When she reminded him of this he just repeated the word “ tray” at her and repeatedly waved his hands at her. Baring in mind he was closer to the trays than she was. She was completely ignored and humiliated. I am absolutely disgusted with the way she and others were treated. Some families didn’t speak much English and they were talked at in the same manner. Utterly disgraceful,2.0
292,"Manchester Airport is one of the worst airports I had to use and I travel a lot. Staff are most certainly inconsiderate and in many cases rude, security check is terrible, I’ve never had some of my items I fly with regularly scanned so many times. My DSLR camera was placed in the basket for re-scan (despite not being told to pull it out of the protective bag before first scan) and it rolled down the basket as it was coming down the line! They security staff is rude and exert their power and are most unfriendly people I have ever had to deal with when travelling through the airports. The queues are long, it’s hard to find your way around, there are people wondering around everywhere not knowing where to go and no one is helping them to find their way. Even at security fast track I was moved down 5 lanes before they finally allowed me to start getting through, even thought I told them I had little time, they made nothing of it. The terminals are packed, there is no way to run through it to catch your flight as there are people everywhere and not enough room to walk between chairs. On the way back at least the stuff was fine, but the pick up car park token charged us three times and still didn’t let us through, until we called an operator who was for once helpful and let us out (rightly so if we had to pay £14.00 for 3 minute pick up stay!). If you really have to travel form there, I recommend to be at least 3-4 hours early, as there is a lot you’ll have to go through before you catch your flight, and most of it won’t be pleasant. I will be avoiding flying from there as much as I can.",1.0
293,"I was travelling with my elderly parents. One with wheelchair assistance and the other part sighted. Having checked our bags in, we proceeded to the lift which takes us to the security check. On reaching the security level, I realised that I had left a bag on the trolley at the side of the lift. I immediately took the lift back down, only to be met by the rudest, most arrogant middle aged security man in a suit. He was incredibly bad mannered and made me feel like a criminal for leaving the bag. He told me that the bag had to be scanned and out of spite and self importance, he decided to punish me by telling the Woman with the scanner to go away and return in 15 to 20 minutes. At one time I touched him on the shoulder and he shouted that I had assaulted him. My parents joined me while he played his little power game. Eventually the scanner slowly strolled back, they nodded to each other and left without a word. While I understand and recognise the importance of security, Airport customers should be treated with a bit of respect and these security people should not be allowed to abuse their position. I have to mention that on our return, the airport staff could not have been more helpful in assisting my parents all the way to the baggage reclaim and I thank for that.",7.0
294,I agree with the earlier review. This airport has become the epitome of the ‘hostile environment’. Travel to and from the airport is made as difficult and expensive as possible. There is little space to secure motorbikes or cycles either and the only space now is outside the station which is as far away from the terminals as possible. The security staff in contrast to most European airports I visit are clueless and rude and it takes two or three times as long to get through. The terminal is dated and dirty with long distances between drop off and departure gates. If there was a pattern for getting the customer experience completely wrong this would be it.,1.0
295,"This airport is outrageously bad and is getting worse every time I travel from here. Staff are inconsiderate and incompetent at their job. Security is an absolute joke. Two security checks open for an entire terminal, not sure who approved that.

Stairs everywhere, completely ignoring the fact that there is families and elderly people travelling who might need help carrying luggage up and down the stairs or even walking up and down the stairs. NEVER not once have I seen airport staff offer help in those cases, because they are not even there. Honestly worst airport in the world probably, you are treated like an inconvenience rather than a customer. Would give -10 stars if I could.",1.0

297,"Going through security and then through the retail area, trying to get to a flight was like something out of Dante. The priorities are totally wrong, acres of real estate devoted to retail, after a cramped, under equipped, under-staffed security. Everyone knows that Manchester has had some horror terrorist incidents, so no sane person could object to proper security, but some airports do make an effort to make the process less unpleasant then others. But not Manchester. There is almost no space to prepare for security: remove a belt - get your phones, wallet, watch etc into a jacket. You do this while in a long queue. You then compete for space at the crates, with no control on keeping a single passenger's crates together. At the other end it's chaos, and if your bag need searching its worse- anything up to a 30-minute wait. The staff are officious but no more so than most - in fact they were pretty good, but if I were entrusted with a serious task like theirs in those surroundings and with that equipment, I'd walk off the job. Once you are through you still have to go endure a tortuous winding course through the retail section, tripling or quadrupling the distance from security to gate - infuriating if security has already made you late. This is by far the worst so-called first-world airport that we have experienced. Avoid if possible.",1.0

After the queues for check in, follow the chaos and panic of security checks at Departures. The rules keep changing and the staff are yelling orders at passengers to keep them moving fast enough to get to their flights on time. This is unpleasant and stressful - not a happy start to a holiday. I am in my late 60s and, while I don't need airport assistance, the amount of walking, queuing and inexplicable going up and down stairs makes using this airport an ordeal. The airport is confusing and sprawling and most escalators and all travelators appear to be out of order. At Arrivals there is a long walk with no toilets until you get through security - it's pot luck how long this takes. The impression I get from this airport is that their only focus is on selling. All refurbishment has gone into duty frees while everything else seems to be shabby and run down. No thought whatsoever has gone into making your transit through this airport more bearable.

I was flying to JFK on Virgin Atlantic due to depart at 10.45am. we were invited to board at about 12.30 but the plane was not at the gate! So we were bussed to the plane on a remote stand and the had to climb steep steps up to the 747, the we spent over 3 hours just sitting on a parked plane! Finally a de-icer truck came to de-ice the wings, only 1 truck so it took over an hour for both wings, an appology from the caption was forthcoming explaining that there is a shortage of de-iceing equipment at the airport and therefore it took so long. We finally bigan to taxi but had to stop again when the plane met up with a mound of snow! Out came the shovels! We finally took off nearly 6 hours late. I have no claims against Virgin but a so called large international airport does not invest in the Infrastructure necessary to keep the airport open at all times and situations. I sent a complaint to the airport, they claim that it is the airline that has the responsibility to de-ice their planes, what they refused to mention was that the airport just didn't have many de-icers! and therefore the airlines would have to literally take a ticket and line up! There are many other changes made in recent years just to line the pockets of their shareholders to the detriment of the passengers. £3 drop off charge (including taxis) claiming it was to reduce congestion! When I complained that the only way to get to the gates was to walk through the shops, (similar to walking through Ikea) they said this was to facilitate passengers who wished to shop!

Then the crowded terminals with poor organization and very unclean toilets and floors. The only good thing is that the staff are (generally) pleasant. Security is an absolute nightmare with seemingly a much more stringent rejection rate for bags going through screening and interminable waiting times in a cramped and disorganized security area. Yes Manchester airport now considers contact lenses a “liquid” as well as powder Ventolin inhalers. Boarding at gates is particularly poor especially for the gates which require going down stairs. Speaking of stairs, arrivals requires an obstacle course of going up and down stairs and it’s painful to watch families with small children, elderly or disabled people try and just get from plane through immigration to baggage claim. Then the price gouging starts again with cars and cabs now paying for the privilege of picking people up.

Arrival: Was all well until I arrived at the passport control. The passport control has been going downhill every flight getting longer and more bureaucratic but frankly this time has outright annoyed me. I was met by three queues which were EU (Electronic Gate), ID Cards and Non-EU. The Non-EU queue was empty as well as the ID Card lane yet the Manchester Airport staff forced people to keep using the E-Gate lane. I had a train to catch due to the flight arriving an hour late and made my way to the front of the empty ID lane only to have an overzealous staff member eject me from that lane back to the E-Gate lane. Luckily a good Samaritan (thank you) let me rejoin the E-Gate lane infront of him for me to get to the train station faster. Oh and to add salt to the wound the E-Gate passport reader failed to read my passport meaning I was sent to a filter queue where my passport was inspected manually anyway by the same immigration officer who would of checked my passport in the ID card lane. The moral of the story is Manchester! Let people choose, we are paying customers. I understand your directing people to the correct lanes but common sense must prevail.

326,As a frequent traveller I try to avoid this airport at all costs. 1. Bags constantly get damaged 2. Waiting times for baggage a joke. 3. Drop off and checking in often 45 minute plus wait. 4.

327,"Departed twice through this airport over the Christmas period. Both dismal experiences. The one on 28th December (T1 Ground floor) was as bad as ever. Security screening chaos. 10 minutes queue just to scan boarding pass then another 35 minutes in human pens in a hall that was never designed for the purpose it is used for. In my lane almost every other bag was stopped for secondary screening. Whilst the staff shout and complain to the passengers it is your fault for delays. My bag packed with the same items, in the same way, had passed through 3 other international airports and also Manchester within the last 5 days with no problem - suddenly was also stopped (for no reason). It is the Manchester screening process & staffing that causes delays not passengers. I suspect it is a combination of poor training and poor equipment that makes MAN have such a high bag rejection rate. Aside from the security issues, the place is a misery of an experience. Walkways, lifts, escalators often don't work or are switched off. There are multitudes of steps, slopes, uneven ground. The lounges are oversold and so dated in facilities. I passed through 3 Vietnamese airports recently and they were like palaces compared to Manchester. It is a grim experience from arrival to departure, whilst paying premium prices for everything. The fact that this situation has existed for so long indicates that the management company has lost it's focus or just doesn't care.",1.0
328,"Probably the worst security experience ever. If you want someone to treat you like a terrorist, you should definitely go/transfer though Manchester airport. They will question you like a robber about liquids, force you to be almost naked and still you’re going to be closely searched for metal pin on your trousers (what for?). After I asked about reasons of such tough security. The answer was: “It’s internal policy. We’re the most secure airport in Europe”. Well. Then it’s the most unreasonable and uncomfortable airport in Europe. 0/5. Next trip though Manchester airport? No, thank you.",1.0

From the carpark ""village"" out of the way, badly signposted and inaccessible, the hideous drop off points and the fact that hundreds of passengers are expected to negotiate lifts to get to departure lounges. The general disrepair and deterioration of services. Overall a poor excuse for an airport and it does not set you up for an enjoyable trip. The majority of the staff I encounter each time I travel through this abomination are rude and surly. They have however managed to renovate the money grabbing duty free area. The lack of signage and the use of pull out tapes everywhere just adds to the overall ""experience' I have travelled through developing countries that have a better idea of service and infinitely superior facilities. Now the lounges or so called - dirty, dilapidated lounges that lack basic services, no charging stations, poor food and drinks and uncomfortable furniture. No showers. Really Manchester Airport, worst experience ever as a premium traveller.",1.0
330,"The security check at Manchester Airport is the most overzealous and inefficient I have ever experienced in my life including anywhere else in the UK and US. First, a security officer demanded that I place every single item I carried with me in a separate tray - handbag, computer, bag of toiletries and jacket, in four separate trays, while being extremely rude and threatening to remove me from the airport when I remarked what a waste of time and space it was. Then, my handbag was singled out for a secondary hand inspection, along with about every other bag that had gone through the scanner. A majority of bags were selected for secondary inspection - never have I ever seen anything like it! There were only two officers manning the secondary inspection queue, despite having approx. 10 bags to check. They were also extremely meticulous with their inspection of every bag, meaning that the queue built up even more. All bags were emptied, and every single container of liquids was picked up and the contents read. After approximately 30-40 minutes, my bag was finally inspected. The officer emptied everything and pulled out a butter knife that I had left long ago at the bottom of my bag. According to him, it was an illegal item, so he tossed it away. However, government security guidelines clearly state that butter knives are permitted! To add insult to injury, I was left to repack my bag all by myself, as the officer had taken everything out and put in a pile on the inspection desk. As a result of this, I barely got on my flight, despite having been at security 1 hour before departure. It's abhorrent to have been held up by rude members of staff, who did not know the rules and enforced them in a far too strict manner, while working in a disorganised and inefficient environment. I will do my very best to try to avoid Manchester Airport in the future! Shambles!",1.0
331,"Yet again Manchester Airport manages to outdo itself in the ‘how not to run an airport’, ‘misery level of the staff that work there’, ‘chaotic security’ and ‘abject lack of any evidence of cleaning for ages’ categories. A serious look needs taking by the authorities that control airports in the UK at the way Manchester is being mismanaged. Security today was abysmal, long queues, miserable staff and a seeming determination to search most bags despite their being nothing of any issue or note in a significant number. Waiting 20 mins for a bag to be searched because of a technical reason with the conveyor whilst being barked at by some idiot in a uniform telling me it must be my fault is not a great start to a journey. Filthy toilets, lack of seating, vastly overpriced ‘food’ and a general feeling of disarray and chaos only adds to the issues through security. Apparently morale with security staff is rock bottom with new recruits leaving after days in the job due to prehistoric HR practices. It most certainly shows. A disaster of an airport that should be avoided if at possible.",1.0

334,"As an expatriate, originally from Manchester I travel to and from Manchester Airport frequently. For many years Manchester Airport has had a bad reputation but now is possibly the worst airport in Europe: run down, poor services, understaffed, outdated manual processes and poor technology. Flying to Switzerland, December 29th 2018: Arriving at the Manchester Airport 2 hours early, queuing started in the taxi, on the ramp, queuing to pay the £3.00 drop off charge (which ironically was introduced to reduce waiting time). Even Taxis pay the drop-off charge, how stupid is that? Then the queuing moved to the soft baggage drop-off and another long wait. After baggage drop-off, we queued for the x-ray machine, I could have also paid £10 fast track, another poor quality rip-off. During baggage x-ray, queuing for the manual body search, testing my shoes and socks for explosives and changing my clear medical bag to smaller separate bags. After this a separate queue for the manual baggage search, because of my laptop cables then the x-ray machine again. Rude pressurized, rundown staff disappearing or generally standing around added to the nightmare. Finally through (nearly two hours later), I managed to get my flight with only a few minutes to spare. I flew into Zurich, with minimal effort, 15 minutes after landing and baggage reclaim I was sat on the train. Phew, welcome to Switzerland! Lessons learned: get the taxi driver to drop off a terminal one roundabout and walk through. Buy a hard-case and a carry-on hard-case with rollers. Pay the £10 Fast Track. Put all my laptop cables etc. in separate clear plastic container and put though x-ray separately. Probably a saving of 1.5 hours. Increasing numbers of flights, taxes and rising costs, persecuting the poor traveller with ever more hidden travel costs, extra drop off charges, queuing charges, long queuing times and desperately poor services. I understand security is paramount, but how do other airports manage to have slick processes, minimum disruption and latest technology? Andy Burnham and Manchester Council, How about redirecting some of the massive profits to modernizing the infrastructure and service quality. Perhaps the Private Sector should take over to get the investment required!",1.0
335,"1) I flew out with Jet2, a budget airline that seems to have its own security area. The experience was dreadful - a huge snaking queue in a cellar until we reached the few actual security lines where each passenger was ordered to stand on a set of footprints on the floor behind someone else until it was our turn. It felt like a prison line with trusties shouting instructions and threats. 'If you fail to take electronics out of your case you could have a 30 minute delay'. My bag was checked leading to a delay and all the checked bags were being rearranged seemingly at random. The staff were not actually rude but clearly under ridiculous pressure as the facilities and staffing are totally inadequate. 2) If the airport spent as much on security throughput as they have on duty free shopping there might be some decent service. 3) On arrival and my departure I used minicabs. The airport charges them £4 in a pick up/drop off parking area. As my baggage was delayed on the incoming flight there was an additional £4 to pay in a pick up parking area that was a shambles with minivans reversing across arriving passengers etc.",2.0
336,Just gone through security at T2 at 7:45 am on 29th of December. The guy in charge of the stand up x-ray machine had a real attitude problem. He was rude and obnoxious. Spoiled the start of our holiday. He should not be in the job with that sort of attitude. He does not belong in a public service environment. He is a disgrace.,2.0
337,Worst Airport Ever! Rude obnoxious staff who treat you like cattle! It's unbelievably grotty considering all the money they squeeze out of every one. I was travelling with my five year old who got swabbed! They then emptied all her little nail varnishes and lip balms and her little bags with hair accessories out on the table! After all the commotion I was then rushed to move out of the way whilst trying to pack it all away again & hold her hand. Also charged for luggage trolleys and then to be dropped off and collected - what a disgrace! I'm ashamed to be from here.,1.0
338,"My experience departing from Manchester Airport was unusually miserable. The worst problem was going through security. I travel with a business backpack that has simple contents, comprising a laptop with a second screen, cables, a power adapter, a daily planner, and sundries. Of course, I took the laptop out of my backpack, and the power adapter as well, because they said it counts as electronic equipment. However, my backpack got selected for manual screening, which is still understandable. But wait, there is more! Every single thing was removed out of my backpack, including the daily planner and sent for a second pass through the x-ray machine. They empty backpack was x-rayed again as well, and it was again selected for manual screening! This time, they swiped it to check for traces of drugs. This made it the very worst security experience in my life, and I do not want to this kind of experience to happen again, and I don't care if I am as the customer is blamed for having it happen to me. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention that the security guard before the x-ray machine told me not to push a tray when I actually pulled it back a bit to put more things in it. He told me I have enough time before my flight, which was entirely irrelevant because there is nothing wrong with holding your tray in place while you are filling it. I think the guard realized there was nothing wrong with that as well, because otherwise he would not have to accuse me of doing the opposite of what I was doing. I hoped to get some relief at the Escape Lounge (Terminal 1), but it was the shabbiest lounge I've ever seen so far, with seats looking like structurally deteriorated and with a poor choice of food. That's fine I guess because my access was free as a credit card benefit, but unlike with other lounges, I don't think this one is worth paying for with cash, not in the state it is currently. The horrible experience with the security screening is certainly unforgettable, and I am thinking about avoiding this airport in the future to not have to deal with this kind of dehumanizing treatment.",2.0

After security check the facilities inside are all terrible, if you need a toilet you may have to go downstairs without any lift and everything is ancient and dirty. Duty free stores are all small and most of cafe is full of people. It seems like this airport never repairs or refurbish for several decades. At the gate, it will take you a long time to find the right way trough long corridor and there are still lack of facilities and gate hall are on the same corridor that everyone have to walk through.

350,"Having used 7 airports in 6 countries in November and December 2018, I am ashamed to say that Manchester was the worst experience. It pains me to say this as a Mancunian who takes great pride in his city and airport, but it needs to be said and things need to change. The security queue at Terminal 1 departures was abysmal, taking a very long time with very long queues and taking me down a narrow coridoor and set of stairs and through a car park, with many confused passengers wondering if we were in the correct queue, and offering very little space to sort myself out (i.e. my hand baggage, things in my pockets, liquids etc.) Also, staff were calling any passengers whose flight started within the next hour to the front of the queue so they don’t miss their flight, completely punishing those who had, like myself, arrived early. This system seemed so unprofessional, so makeshift - I felt almost like a school child being ushered into a que by his supply teacher during a fire drill. This was a shame because I was unable to enjoy my lounge experience which I paid for. I felt robbed. Speaking of lounge experience, I am Muslim and there were no halal meat options for breakfast. I asked staff at the information desk if there were any restaurants or eateries which served halal meat and they could not answer confidently. In the lounge, there were barely any good vegerarian options either, such as waffles, hash browns etc. If Manchester Airport wants to adequately serve its multicultural customer base and extend its reach to be a truly global airport, this needs addressing urgently. When arriving back in Manchester a month later, Terminal 1 arrivals was horrible. There were only 6 carousels bringing in passengers’ baggage (in a supposedly international terminal) and ours took an age to arrive. To be fair immigration was quick, but the ques for non-EU passengers looked very long. Upon arriving after a long haul flight, there was to my disgust and anger no prayer room to pray my morning prayer or again grab some halal food (again, can Manchester Airport claim it serves rhe basic needs of its multicultural passenger base?) The toilets smelt of urine. Also the general feel of T1 Arrivals was that it was outdated and archaic. The low ceilings, blue and yellow signage and old tiled floors all made it look like a 1970s hospital ward. Also, I was shocked that passengers were being made to pay for luggage trollies - something which I have not seen in any airport to date. Finally, my friend picked us up and had to wait in a long and dysfunctional queue in order to pay for parking which was using plastic coin tokens - this system was barely working and people had to keep calling the helpdesk which made the matter even longer. And the plastic coin token parking ticket machines were placed in front of the main exit doors, meaning that passengers, with their luggages, had to weave in and out of others who were simply trying to pay for parking. That’s right, there was a plastic coin token system which was being used to allow passengers to pay for parking in 2018!",2.0

Standing in the middle of a carpark for over thirty minutes (with no shelter) is not acceptable for a so-called 'international airport'.

When you finally escape the “dungeon “ you arrive at the brightly lit shopping mall! You have no choice but to walk through this haven of retail enticement. No expense spared by Manchester Airport authority to extract more funds from the travelling public. Perhaps one day they will realise that they need to spend more of their “ill gotten gains” on providing facilities that matter more to the travelling public. Fortunately we had booked into the Aspire Lounge which gave us a much needed break from the chaos of Terminal 1. Our arrival at Malaga Airport was a revelation. No queuing, no unpleasant staff and effortless transit through the terminal. Our departure 4 days later was even more dramatic than the dismal experience at Manchester earlier in the week.

After going round the houses on this I asked for his name, which he refused to give me, I pointed out that he must have known he was in the wrong or he would give me his name.

365,"Not an enjoyable experience. Terminal 3 is far too busy to accommodate the number of passengers. No available seating, people sitting on the floor. Bar ridiculously busy. Long waits for bag checks in security, 20+ minutes. Unable to access airport lounge with priority pass as it was full.",3.0
366,"I travelled back from Manchester airport to Berlin with Easy Jet. I went into the security check far more than an hour before departure and ended up running through the airport to catch my flight. Almost didn't make it. Later I learned from other passengers that this is not unusual. At the security ckeck all my hand luggage was checked as if I was a suspected terrorist.  I am a 51 year old german woman and I have no idea what was on the mind of the staff member at security check 14. She went through my whole luggage, digged through it wildly, messing it all up. Even tried to open a little present for my daughter with a bracelet inside. It was all totally senseless, useless and obviously she took pleasure from harassing me. After a while I told her that my flight would leave in 25 minutes she wasn't impressed at all and told me I would make it - which I almost didn't. It was the worst experience I ever had at an airport. I was never treated that way. I will try to avoid the airport in the future. Thanks for this experience.",1.0
367,"My husband and I were flying from Manchester to Edinburgh whilst on a UK holiday. Overall we travelled to or from 10 airports and are seasoned travelers. Manchester was by far the worst. Going through security we were all waived forward by a staff person screeching, belts off, watch off etc. The other counters were all as loud. Then my handbag and holdall were in the special check line, which is fine! I had accidently left an inhaler in my handbag. What was not fine was the way the employee played games and kept on putting various bags at the back of the luggage queue like 3-4 times, all the time being curt and loud when he did deal with passengers. A business woman next to me was almost in tears and was ready to just walk out without her bag as we had waited for over 20 min and she was late for a meeting. I waived her ahead of me and asked the polite pleasant staff member what was going on. His reply was, I don't do that but I'm not senior. The area was loud, scruffy and just horrible. I'd rather catch 5 trains then do that again. When we left Gatwick a few weeks later, I had to tell a manager what a great airport it was, staff were polite, efficient and helpful and did a good job. Manchester was just plain awful, do management ever read reviews?",2.0
368,Manchester Airport used to be a source of northern pride but has continued a gradual decline into embarrassment. Pick up charges that should shame even the most greedy corporation with the insulting explanation that the motive was for security and congestion! Broken travellators in T1. Slow baggage collection T1 (no other flights in collection area but took 45 mins). Dirty areas around gates. Poor toilet cleaning.,2.0
369,"Flew out of T1 and found it to be chaotic and poorly laid out with countless flights of stairs to navigate, endless dark corridors and little signage. On entering the terminal from the Meet & Greet car park your first mission is to cross the flow of passengers exiting from Arrivals before having to queue for the lift up to Departures. The Lufthansa desk was hidden behind the main check in area in a poorly signposted area of the building. After checking in we had to take our car seat to the oversize baggage area where the sole agent took an age to deal with the queue of people. After this we saw a glossy entrance to the security area but were informed this was for fast track or priority passengers only so were sent down the stairs to the basement where the regular security area is. Then it was back up some more stairs to the departure lounge by which time we had only enough time to pick up a coffee before going to the gate despite having arrived over 2 hours before our flight. Even on the way to the gate there were more stairs, down then back up to navigate with our hand luggage. All in all a very stressful experience. The return was slightly better in that there was no queue at immigration and the bags arrived within 15 minutes, but we still had to negotiate the stairs out of the terminal to the car park. I will avoid in the future if I can. Birmingham is a much more pleasant experience.",1.0
370,"Returned from a weeks break in Lanzarote. The flight was earlier than scheduled however the queue to get through passport control was a joke. They try and get you to use the automatic passport scanners but out of 5 only 3 were working and it's not quick getting through those. Apart from the scanners queue there were hundreds of people trying to get through the ""normal"" route and it was pandemonium. One fellow traveler who travels the world in his line of business said in his experience of all the airports he has travelled to and through Manchester without a doubt was the worst. About time for some improvement Manchester? The drop off parking arrangements are a rip off, in fact a complete disgrace particularly as disabled drivers are also made to pay. However if your passenger is disabled and you manage to find someone in authority, apparently they are about, then it seems one can get out without having to pay but if you the driver are disabled you pay. Not an even playing field. At the arrivals park for Terminal 1 I actually saw a Taxi being told to move his van from a Disabled Parking Space. About time the people policing the parking did something positive as on previous visits all disabled spaces were full of taxis!",1.0

372,"Today I had a very stressful and frustrating experience at Manchester airport. We checked in our baby car seat at Ryanair and we then had to take it to the baggage inspection area to drop it off. There was a very long queue and we lost 20-25mins waiting to drop off the car seat. There was only one staff member there and the process was very slow, many passengers were complaining as it was causing many of us unnecessary delays. Next came security, this was also extremely busy and we only had 40 mins till our flight was due to leave. It took us around 10mins to get through security and then I was caused anxiety by the fact every single one of our bags (x4) had been moved to the checking area and we realised there was a huge backlog of suitcases for them to check and only 2/3 staff checking them very slowly. I asked how long it would be as we had very little time for our flight the staff member was very rude and said you'll just have to wait I'm afraid and if you're not happy speak to the manager over there. I went and spoke to the manager and explained we were going to miss our flight, I also explained I'm pregnant and had already had delays at bag drop off and this was causing me stress, he asked the staff to fast track us and hurry up but the staff member continued to check every single bag slowly and showed no signs of trying to speed the process up. We eventually got our bags checked and ran to the gate, our flight was already boarding and we just made it with no time to even buy water or food The whole experience was just so slow and unnecessarily stressful. My husband and I travel a lot especially my husband for work and he said it was by far the worst airport he's ever been through. Bad organisation, slow, curt, arrogant staff.",1.0
373,"I am ashamed that this airport is in my home city. I have travelled to well over 200+ airports and this is one of the worst. Majority of the staff are jobsworth, idiots, queues are long, the whole set up is just a joke. Every time I pass enough I end up stressed, and I am almost considering boycotting this airport all together and just using a taxi from alternatives. Living in Singapore for 3 years was a dream to fly in/out. Perhaps management should take note of how they do things.",1.0
374,"The taxi pick up at T3 is the main subject of this review. A total disgrace, unreasonable costs for taxi drivers, lack of signage, lack of information. Frustration all round. The 3 in T3 presumably means 3rd World. There is little good to say about T3 - the passenger route from the plane to the passport control is long and there are steep steps - a nightmare for older passengers. The lifts can only be operated by staff. On a previous trip I asked after the advertised shuttle service from T3 to the rail station to be told there wasn't one, despite information on the website to the contrary. I was told ""the website is full of lies"" My Ryanair flight (used more than 50 times) used to go to/from Liverpool (Bliss).",1.0

I arrived at Terminal 3 security 2 hours before my flight was due to depart at 5:40am. Access to security was limited due to the length of the queue starting immediately at the boarding card barrier. Security staff started to call the 06:05 Amsterdam flight through to ensure passengers got on the plane. No mention be of the 5:40 flight, or any other flight departing before 06:05. I almost missed my boarding time due to the length of security queue. Either expand the area and operate sufficient number of security scanners or reduce/redirect flights. The security provision cannot sustain the number of flights, leading me to believe that profits are a significantly higher priority than passenger provision.",1.0

Manchester was dirty, slow, unwelcoming and staff inefficient and rude.",2.0
377,"Flew out of Manchester Airport, Terminal 1, on 27th September. We checked in the night before, using the Sundowner option, which is a good idea and saved quite a bit of time the following morning. Arriving about 5am in the departure lounge, we made our way to the Fast Track area and were told it was closed, so we were all herded like cattle down the stairs into the 'basement'. This was dirty, scruffy, overly-crowded and other passengers were also complaining about not being able to use the Fast Track service. We found the airport not to be as clean and tidy as you might expect from an international airport, but when you consider that East Midlands Airport is owned by the same company, we shouldn't have been too surprised. Most of the staff could have been more polite and courteous - they need some re-training on customer service. Sign-posting should be improved as we came from Radisson Blu connecting walkway and got lost between floors, having used the lift. Others also seemed confused. On arrival back at Manchester on 5th October, we waited a very long time for our cases to come through and they weren't on the carousel properly at all. They were dirty and damaged - the edges were scuffed and these were brand new for this holiday. Now they look ten yrs old! Manchester baggage handlers! We found Manchester Airport to be very unsatisfactory, so much so that we have cancelled next year's holiday to Mexico flying from Manchester, and will re-book elsewhere. We would not recommend this airport to any family or friends.",1.0
378,"I was aware of massive construction at Manchester airport in the UK so added extra time to arrive and depart. Arrival and clearing customs was not bad at all. We are non-EU and it took a reasonable amount of time. Getting to the car hire Village involved a coach ride which was not bad. Leaving the car hire Village was and getting onto the motorway was not bad either, but now we come to the bad part. Returning to Manchester Airport Car Hire Village. Anticipating a problem, we stayed at a hotel just outside the airport. We had a map and programmed the SAT-NAV with the latest information we could download. Even with all that, we could not find the location to return the car. There were closed roads and re-routed roads but no signs directing us to the return Village. Seeing that it was close to long term parking, we followed signs to long term but not only did we not find the place, we could not turn around and had to enter and pay for parking just to get out. Finally, we asked a construction worker who told us to get out of the airport area, then look for Terminal 2. That was good advice and we eventually found small yellow signs directing us to car return. The nice people at the car hire are aware of the situation and have complained about lack of signage. They were told Council did approve of signage so the rental people put up a few of their own. If we had not built in an extra 45 minutes into our travel plans we could have been late for check in. And so I am saying that while construction may be unavoidable, poor on no signage for car return is not. They need to fix the problem now. It was a horrible experience. And a warning to people with allergies, in International departure we were directed through an aisle that wound through a mall of duty free fragrances. It went on and on. Try to avoid that.",3.0
379,"Conflicted! MAN has had a hard (and often well justified) time on this website - and I've actively contributed to it, albeit with a heavy heart as a proud Lancastrian. However our most recent experience in T1 - outbound mid-morning 08 Oct, returning late afternoon 18 Oct - was an exception to recent experiences - both ours and those flagged up on this website. What you can't tell from such a grab sample was whether we were very lucky, or whether at last the criticism from so many folk on this site and others has caused the boss class to get out of their ivory tower and get a grip. I know what I'd like to think was the case, but I'm burdened with scepticism. Suffice to say that security outbound was professional, polite and efficient. Breakthrough? There was still the endless traipse through untold retail opportunities - does anybody ever buy enough stuff they don't need to justify these places? Then to find closed toilets - and back-track. The departure gate was hopelessly overcrowded (as ever) but no doubt MAN are confident that the DC3 will be re-introduced shortly on most European routes so that problem will be solved. But against all odds we left on time, and as we subsequently discovered, with our luggage. On return there was the usual wait while the problem that has foxed MAN for years was resolved - if a plane arrives on time does that mean we need to have an airbridge operator available somewhere in South Manchester - once he's had his tea of course? Finally released we had an almost effortless transit through UK Border, who even allowed us to back-track to unused e-gates rather than adding to a mounting queue at their preferred solution. Arrival in baggage hall to see bags arrive a moment later. The attempt to automate key retrieval at Meet & Greet failed spectacularly, so we depended on a human. Given that the folk at M&G have a far stronger grip on the essentials of customer service than anyone else at MAN that wasn't a problem - and we were soon sorted. It does of course explain why the accountants are keen to automate and get rid of such competence lest it corrupt other parts of MAN. So - half-term report. It's better than it was - based on a very small sample. But there's a long way to go to get close to where the heart of the Northern Powerhouse thinks it ourght to be.",6.0
380,"What a disgrace! Almost every flight was delayed. Not quite what you expect at 11pm! Shuttle busses to terminal ridiculously cramped our party was split up too. Passport control had a skeleton crew despite 11 flights due to land within a 30 min period. Coincidentally several flights landed very close together due to delays and there were insufficient staff to process incoming passengers in a timely manner. We landed at 10.53. The 10.06 flight was still waiting around the luggage carousel - thankfully we just had carry ons. My wife stood in arrivals waiting for us at the help desk trying to find out what the delay is as screen states flight has landed. She was promptly cut short as shutters came down as its gone 11pm and they are not prepared to stay open any longer (in other words, stuff all the customers on delayed planes). Parking is another hideous failing! Just to drop off outside the terminal is £3 for 1-5 mins. Seriously, it felt like a military operation, pull up, jump out, throw bags out of car, hugs goodbye, don't know know when I'll see you again, quickly jump back into the car before the 5mins is up. Parking for arrivals is £4 for 30mins my wife always arrives 15-20mins after our flight is due to land to avoid going over the 30 mins period as it jumps to £6.50. Sadly when she left home she didn't know flight was delayed. I counted 3 pay machines that were out of order!! Huge queues in arrivals terminal so headed out to the car park, again huge queues! The machine wouldn't accept £10 notes the gentleman stood at the neighbouring machine and I couldn't get it to work. The oncall system suggested screwing up the note! That was not successful. No further assistance given! An employee rocks up and pushes the oncall system no help there! People behind getting frustrated so gentleman behind offers to pay with his card (as he was going over the 30mins) machine wouldn't accept his card! Taxi driver offers coins! Finally gentleman at the machine next to me after 20+ attempts has his £10 accepted. Glory be! But not for the people behind him who have now gone over the 30mins! Guess what! Next gentleman takes several mins trying to pay puts him over the 30mins so is charged £6.50 oncall system don't want to do anything to help! Another lady lost her parking token down the grate in the car park. They charge her £5 for a new token plus her £4 parking charge! She had been in car park less than 15mins. Just when you think the drama is over you realise that car park is designed so that all the cars have to exit one way to the right and loop round the car park only to join a large queue at the end of each row and wait patiently for someone to let you out! 20 mins to exit the car park is a joke and only 2 out of 3 lanes were operational. Since July when the new parking charges were introduced the airport are making money at every turn. Passengers are already bringing money into the terminal and the majority will spend something on food, drinks, or duty free so why fleece them when they are being dropped off and picked up? Morally reprehensible! Flew from Liverpool earlier in the month. Terminal is clean, and you can be dropped off for free and just walk a few hundred yards 3-4 mins to the terminal.",1.0

I would say, the security people have a stressful job and in a pretty oxygen-deprived room. However, airports on the continent manage a difficult job with some charm and a glint of humour, rather than something semblant of Stalag 13 (a slight exaggeration, but nonetheless).

Thankfully I have only another 2 flights booked out of this third world airport. Looks like it will be KLM to AMS and beyond from MME in future unless Carlisle actually opens and serves LCE. Outbound from T1. Once again security is a joke and nothing more than a self perpectuating industry that serves itself rather than passengers. Bag was rescanned due to a AAA battery not being in my electrical bag. The body scanners are either not operating or operatives do not know how to use them or why would there be a need to give each passenger a pat down as well. NAIA or BKK are a dream compared to this airport. The mess outside is even worse. The entire management team needs to be fired for incompetence.",1.0

384,"I flew from Manchester to Venice on 6th October, and returned on 11th October. I've flown in and out of Manchester Airport many times over the years. The experience has never been a pleasant one, but it has got continually worse. The security staff at Departures were reasonably polite and efficient and this wasn't the horror I've experienced before. The shop area is bright and glossy, but then you come to the seating and refreshment areas. These are so depressing and dirty. Manchester Airport has gone for the numbers, both in terms of passengers and income, and drossed over (no gloss I'm afraid!) capacity issues. The whole area needs brightening up, and staff employed to clear rubbish away and keep the place clean. But that then needs money. You'd think they were short of money. Think again. I'll come back to that later. Despite all of this, I can easily say that departure was infinitely better than arrivals! The flight from Venice on 11th October left virtually ontime, and before take off the captain announced that we should be landing in Manchester just after 23.00. We actually landed at 23.01. He knew, we knew and apparently Manchester Airport knew as a relative looked on the Airport website where the expected time was shown as 23.01. Why then did it take around 15 minutes after the plane came to a halt at Manchester for the steps to arrive? Had news not got through to the groundstaff, or did they just not care how long the passengers on the plane had to wait? Next, you have to climb up several flights of stairs to the arrivals corridor. We got to the end of the corridor and found that the door was locked. Again was this bad communications or someone not caring. We were eventually released and headed to immigration. There were quite a few passport reading machines ""open"", but half of these didn't work properly. We were shouted at for not putting the passports in the ""right way"". People were directed to more machines, and half of those weren't working properly either. Eventually some staff were moved onto immigration desks, and we all got through very quickly. Are the machines there for added security, or to save money. I think the latter. It wouldn't take a great deal of money to iron out these problems. You'd think the Airport was short of money! Well, in 2016 Manchester Airport Group paid out dividends totalling £115.8 million, and in 2017 these rose to £140.9 million. 64.5% of this was paid to Manchester City Council and the other 9 Greater Manchester Councils. They are the principal shareholders Instead of us all moaning on this site, a better option to improve things might be to bombard councillors of these local authorities with complaints. They might then get fed up with the hassle and try and bring pressure to bear to improve things. I imagine most of them have experienced these problems themselves or know friends or relatives who have.",3.0

Totally confusing and movement between terminals can take you outside in the rain and through enclosed walkways where very few of the moving walkways are working. Going through security was as bad in two of the terminals I used. Down in the bowels of the airport - low ceilings with piping. It was hot and I felt sick queuing.

Instead of insulting, hostile behaviour, the security staff were almost decent (everything's relative: you have very low expectations when you fly from Manchester) and the flight left on time. Reassuringly, on my return Manchester was back to its typical hostility. First came the mandatory fifteen minute wait on the plane while they found the steps for embarkation -it seems always to take them by surprise that planes arrive on time and then came an additional burden, a trip round the airport on a bus, which also got stuck because, as the driver informed us, road works meant that only one bus could disembark passengers at a time.

A shame, as the flight was not too bad with Thomas Cook. I will never set foot into this hovel of a place again.

The queues at passport control were ridiculous! 3 hours families with small children and elderly people having to wait while airport staff just stood around. My traveling companion by this time was absolutely tired out we had been up since 5.30am and at 83yrs old she just could not stand anymore I shouted over to a member of staff to ask if they could get her through and they did. They did not let me through or even ask me or the lady if she was with anyone so she ended up going through on her own and still had to wait for me to get through for almost another hour. Thank goodness she was able to sit and wait for me to finally join her. I realize that there is some waiting around but staff should have allowed the elderly and families with young children through first instead they just stood around chatting to each other not taking any notice of anyone who may have needed any help. Manchester Airport was always a great place to depart and arrive from sadly this is not the case anymore, it is staffed by uncaring staff that are more interested in chatting to each other when they are not screeching at poor people who just want to get home.

The recent charges for the drop off are lets be honest ridiculous. Its always been the taxi drivers queuing up who cause the problem, not just normal people dropping off. The £100 fine for picking up from departures is beyond ridiculous, again taxi drivers abused this easy and quick way of getting people away from the airport. Why doesn't the free bus from the jet park to departures go round to arrivals and take people back to the jet park for free so we can pick people up in the same place we dropped them off. Are these buses empty? If anyone can answer that last question about the bus, it would be greatly appreciated. Just to add a note about the star ratings below, an airport is an airport to me, I'm only there to check in and wait before I fly. Do not complain if you are flying to Spain for £10. You will be with another bunch of people flying for the same price. You will be treated like cattle.",8.0
397,"I could describe the departure security as chaos as a negative, but that pales into insignificance compared to the indignity that I witnessed from the security staff this past weekend. In this day and age, we all understand and appreciate the importance of security in airports and I am sure that most people understand the necessity of personal searches and long queues. In general, applaud the job done by most security personnel. However, I cannot extend this sentiment to staff at Manchester Airport as there is no excuse for the security staff treating people with the lack of respect and lack of dignity that I witnessed a few days ago. I don't believe that any airport staff should have the right to shout at passengers no matter what the circumstance yet the shouting at people and stopping just short of verbal abuse was clearly the norm at Manchester Airport security. This behavior was widespread across the security staff that I encountered as they strutted around and shouted at passengers. I even saw one lady get manhandled by the person searching her and was shocked by the indignity she had to endure when he top was 'accidentally' lifted to reveal her bra to everyone around her. I never noticed an apology. I also noticed a staff member going out of his way to provoke a lady as she packed her goods onto a conveyor box, fortunately she had the strength of character not to lower herself to his level of disrespect, as I expect this is exactly what he wanted. Clearly, there was petty-power and safety in numbers at play because I cannot believe that a group of people would behave this way of their own accord. When asked about why there was such a harsh approach, one of the staff dismissed this by saying that they had just worked a 12 hour shift. True or not, this does not excuse treating people this way and smacks of lack of management, lack of training and inadequate staff controls by the senior staff at the airport. I include the Manchester Airport CEO in this because the buck stops with him. I can only think that transit passengers put up with this anti-social behavior from airport staff because passengers feel out of control and are at the mercy of some unscrupulous security people because these people the power to make life very miserable for people intending to travel. Passengers therefore have no option but to put up with this (and the security staff know it!). I find it interesting that most of the travel experiences that I have encountered at other airports (and I travel a lot) are not like this. This appears to be endemic to Manchester Airport, again an indication of poor management in my opinion. To the security staff at Manchester Airport that feel that it is ok behave as described above, shame on you. It is unnecessary. I am afraid that my entire review of the airport is tainted by this experience. I seldom complain about anything, but this experience, I could not let slip. I only hope that this is an effective platform for this review and that it has goo reach. I will ask readers to push out as much as possible on social media because we simply cannot quietly accept this behavior.",1.0
398,"This airport is appalling. Dreadful, ignorant and full of self importance staff and bureaucratic management. No wonder they can't get the staff and have very low staff retention rate. They have tiny bit of power and intend to use it, it is pathetic!. No leniency for geniune people like myself who had not been to the airport for a long while. I pick up my husband and noted lots of signs. Due to a queue of traffic I was unable to slow to virtual stop to read them properly. All I noted was 0-5 min £3 so off I went to pick up my husband and got fined £25. Diabolical. This is a drop off zone only I was told. A guy said ""Is this your first time?"" and said yes, unaware of what the issue was. He explained further and no mention of a fine so I said ""Where do I go to pay the £3"" he said ""Just go to the barrier"". So whilst I was on my way he clearly used his radio to tell control centre, then he scurried off like the snake he is. After a massive row to no avail, I asked for the person's name who put this stupid policy in place, they wouldn't give it, no receipt either for forced payment. Nowhere does it say in Big Letters ""You will be Fined"". Appalling!. No doubt our Mayor Burnham is behind this as he is behind the mess in Manchester City centre!. I will vote with my feet and money and others should do the same, it is another money making scam. I will be booking my next holiday to go from Liverpool - never an issue there and far more pleasant.

Finally we were allowed on only to get to gate and not allowed off. Waited again 15 minutes on bus. Coming back through security was also an awful experience. Systems that didn't work, incredibly rude biligerent individuals, a security person saying one thing and another something different. Ages to get through security and simply for a domestic flight. I am a frequent flyer so absolutely know the drill. I totally accept that in this day and age a high level of security is required but this morning was utter chaos.

401,"Dreadful experience of this airport. Arrival was appalling. Landed late and were not allowed to exit aircraft. Bus was next to aircraft to take us to terminal but as no gate allocated, we were not allowed to leave aircraft. Captain announced that we would be delayed and asked everyone to sit in our seats again. 25 minutes later we were finally allowed on bus. Got to gate 150 and again stood on but a further 15 until someone received authorisation for us to exit bus and to go through gate. Departure also awful. Security was a nightmare. As a frequent flyer I am used to the extra security but at this airport, the staff were rude, belligerent, unhelpful and simply not enough of them. Queues in T3 were long, unorganised and not enough signage to clearly show procedures. My boarding pass was not recognised by the scanning machine. I asked for help and this was begrudgingly given with no smile or any sympathy. It would still not go through and I was told to either return to check in or go to another long queue and see a colleague. I decided to queue and fifteen minutes later I got to front of queue and miraculously, my boarding card scanned first time. Then queued a further twelve minutes to actually get to the security checks. I only had my handbag and laptop. Split everything into separate boxes, as usual, and that went okish. Went through body scanner and pulled aside. Was then individually scanned. Then asked to remove shoes and sit down. Shoes taken for scanning and then my feet were scanned. Was advised shoes would appear on same place as my laptop and handbag. Everything arrived apart from shoes. I asked where they might be and told I was in right place. Five minutes later still no shoes and stood in tights on cold floor. Asked someone else and advised me that shoes go to a different area. Eventually found them. Lastly, with my boarding card not working my husband and I were spilt up as he had gone through before me. He had no baggage at all. He was quite rightly asked to remove his coat, which he did. He was scanned as was his coat and then he too was pulled aside to be individually scanned. He had his vetolin asthma inhaler in his coat pocket. He as advised this was not acceptable and inhalers must be put in a clear plastic bag and dealt with separately. We are both asthmatic and have inhalers. Never before have we been asked to seperate our inhalers. And, actually, mine was in my handbag and went through without issue. I fully accept the necessity for security at airports and have absolutely no problem with it. But, it should be done efficiently and by staff who are well trained, with consistent procedures, helpful and cheerful. Yes, it is a difficult job but there is no excuse for rudeness or inconsistent procedures.",1.0
402,"I have used meet and greet several times this year and found the process to be very pleasant, especially when you return and just want to get into your car and get off. However, I have booked my car in this week and found the charges for a 7 day stay very expensive £79.95 when the most I have previously paid was around £60. Today my son has booked his car in for exactly the same dates as we are going away as a family and he has only paid £49.95. I was somewhat dismayed as I also had the 15% discount voucher so I contacted the airport directly and was told that it was tough on me as they have the policy to change parking prices on a daily basis!! So the message here is, do not book on your first visit, keep checking the prices to make sure that you get the best possible deal that you can. Something I will be doing from now on. Oh, and they said that they would not give me a reduction and or offer me anything as a gesture of goodwill! For a small gesture, they could have kept a happy customer instead they now have someone who will be looking for faults on every visit on principal.

Even before this we had to endure long queues to get through security, queues in the toilets, queues in the shops. If the terminals can't cope with the number of passengers why are they accepting all these flights? By the way the security staff are unfortunately rather aggressive and unpleasant. I appreciate it must be an awful environment to work in but there is no need to be rude to the travellers. Would I fly from Manchester again? Not if I can help it!

406,"A nightmare, it’s reached the point of being the worst airport I’ve used in my whole life including many in Europe, USA, the Middle East and Asia. During the last 25 years I’ve flown from Australia to the UK every 1 to 2 years alternating between Manchester and Heathrow airports depending on airline, fare and itinerary. In this time, I’ve seen Manchester deteriorate to reach rock bottom while Heathrow has improved, I never have any problems there. Manchester is the most convenient airport for visiting family who lived nearby and who now live in Cumbria but on this last visit I decided to use Heathrow despite needing to get from there to Euston Station and having a much longer journey north. Unfortunately, I still needed to use Manchester to fly to and from Dubrovnik for a holiday with family. Check in and security on departure were actually better than the last experience I had here, still not efficient but the staff were quite pleasant, not rudely bellowing instructions and treating passengers like cattle as they were on my last visit. Regrettably I was caught up in a 2-hour immigration queue on my return. Finally, it was my turn to be processed by a sour faced immigration officer and then to reclaim my luggage. Luggage enquiries directed me to Carousel 5 where one lonely bag was going around and around, it wasn’t mine! I waited till the carousel stopped then went back to enquiries. This time I was directed to Carousel 6 where I found my case. It was now 3 hours since my flight had landed, I’d missed the train I was booked on, my ankles had swollen and my legs had flared with eczema after standing for such a long time, not much fun for someone in their 70’s. I later learned that my sister and brother-in-law had also been delayed at the airport. In their case it was waiting for luggage, they’d cleared immigration more quickly due to their UK passports. I could have used mine but would still have had to wait while my husband queued with his Australian passport. Our daughter and her colleague travelling on a business trip from Australia also had the misfortune of using this airport. When they arrived at mid-morning the immigration area was fairly quiet with only about 20 people waiting to be processed. They were all left stranded when the only immigration officer on duty took off (for morning tea?). It took some time for a replacement officer to arrive. Our daughter laughed, she knew what to expect, but what a poor impression it gives of the UK. My husband is refusing to use Manchester airport again.",1.0

I am forced to use this airport every week for business trip and I will change my destination as soon as an alternative arises. Ground staff unavailable. It happens once every two trips that it takes 5 to 10 mn to get the bridge to disembark from the aircraft. Sometimes, even the guidance of the aircraft to its parking stop is not available! Security checks picky, slow and not efficient. They have installed body scanners that lead me almost systematically to be searched (obviously for nothing!) after passing through. Where is customer respect? Adjust the detection level or scrap this. When you are unlucky enough to have your luggage randomly searched, it can take up to 20 min (Yes, twenty!) to have it done! If security wants to be picky, they have to re-staff urgently! Car rental shuttle irregular, unreliable and uncomfortable. You can wait up to 20-30 mn to get the shuttle, as the traffic in the airport is so badly organized and regulated. More: their badge to pass the automatic gate does not always work. I saw one bus stuck 5 mn at the gate, forced to call for assistance to have the gate opened. Ridiculous! Not to mention the driving abilities of some drivers who confuse airport shuttle and rally, and the water flowing under the shuttle door and soaking the bus floor when there is heavy rain. Crowded and unpleasant (T3). When a flight is boarding, it becomes almost impossible to walk through the gates area. The lounges are undersized compared to the airport traffic. Do not know BA lounge but only 1903 lounge has a friendly staff and international standard quality.

411,Utter utter chaos! Terminal 1 arrivals car park was full to gridlock. Cars were queuing back to the M56 just to get in to Manchester airport. I feel so sorry for those people who had allowed good time to catch flights but were stuck in a traffic jam. The authorities deserve to lose their licence to run an airport given the complete gridlock that resulted from what I assume was a completely predictable bottleneck caused by scheduled incoming flights. (Maybe there was some other reason - but Manchester certainly didn't tell us anything!). The poor parking attendants were doing their best to move vehicles out of the airport. They were operating the exit barriers as fast as they could - getting vehicles to leave the site for free. But the exit barriers were shutting down. They were not even allowed to open the gates manually. Utterly deplorable. At terminal one there were 3 exit gates. I heard one parking attendant pleading with his manager to allow him to open the gates manually whilst miles of incoming traffic backed up from the M56. One of the gates had shut down for a reason we could not fathom - thus reducing exit traffic to 2 lanes - and having a knock on effect on the incoming traffic. Recommend that you avoid Manchester as a travel hub. They are incompetent and seriously need to improve their act. We shall certainly avoid this airport in future.,1.0

On our way home we wanted to get some dinner at the airport but even arriving early, the queue at security took over one hour. We had no time for any dinner so got onto our return flight very hungry.

The approach road to T3 from Styal is no better than a country lane and that to an airport aspiring to international acclaim. Add to this the walk passengers have to take on arrival, through narrow corridors, up and down narrow stairs (T2) and then the long queues at immigration and the slow baggage delivery, what do foreign visitors have to think?

However the collection was an entirely different story, upon arrival I was unable to get anywhere near the entrance & was told very rudely & repeatedly by a very patronising security man that we would be charged £100 if we did not use the car park & there were no concessions for blue badge holders. I am unsure as to how to expect people who are unable to walk to be collected. My brother had to then go back & fetch another wheelchair to be able to get my Mum to the car park.

Totally unacceptable arrangements for the disabled & nothing but a money making enterprise at the cost of customer service.

The approach to T1 was straightforward, no road works no traffic jams dead easy. Went to check in desk at 0735 and was checked in immediately and efficiently by a very pleasant gentleman. Now for the part most travellers dread, security. Our boarding passes and passports were checked and the boarding passes did not scan. No problem, the chap on the desk was laughing and joking and was very pleasant. We had fast track priority to security but did not need it as, at 0750 there was NO ONE in the security line. We walked straight to the desk where we were greeted by a very friendly and polite young lady. Passing through the scanner, I set the alarm off and was subject to a body search. The chap that carried this out was polite and apologetic about having to search me. Once searched we then went through the maze that is duty free and went to the Aspire lounge to wait for the flight. This proved to be the worst part as the toilets were not very clean and certainly needed an air freshener. Boarding the plane was painless and I still cannot believe that this happened at Manchester. On our return two weeks later, we had the normal forced march from the gate to immigration. Although another wide bodied jet had landed at the same time as us, we managed to get through immigration with just a 15 minute delay.

The queue is absolute chaos and moves at a snails pace compared to any other airport I've been to - even in countries significantly poorer than Britain. I've seen staff seem to be trying to make the queue ""efficient"" by shunting people into different aisles at their own whim so I've ended up seeing people who were in the queue behind me getting to the top of the queue before me. And then when they've failed to help passengers up through the queue in time for their flight, they eventually shout at those leaving on a certain flight to move up to the top of the queue. The low ceiling makes it an unpleasant experience too. The staff seem to also have been trained to be wholly unpleasant and shout continuously at those in the queue about liquids etc, trying to imply that we're to blame for the pace of the queue! A polite, electronic message would be far more tolerable when you're standing around listening to it for 45+ minutes. I've been to extremely busy airports where the staff still manage to be friendly, helpful and efficient.

As a traveller requiring disabled assistance through inability to walk distances passengers are left at the building entrance where you then have to find without adequate signage the area where you are allowed to be picked up which is inside a lower deck car park. This works ok for drop off being near the building doors even though it charges £3 to be released from the area. The big problem when having found the pickup area is the chaos they have created in the fact that everyone is oblivious to the system, where I witnessed others scrambling to meet their collectors even to the point of a adult and child being hit with the entrance barriers trying to get in the cars there as the is inadequate area's to stop. Whoever is collecting you has a ticket which has to be paid for at a machine away from the exit barriers again nowhere for them to park to be able to pay along with no signage instruction that you cannot pay at the exit barrier, which should be displayed at the entry barrier. One day there will be accidents to pedestrians and the airport and council of Manchester will only have themselves to blame for having to pay compensations for their shortsighted penny pinching ideas.

No big lines for check in and security was fast for us due to us purchasing fast pass. However we tried to access a lounge via my membership and at 2 of the lounges were told they were full and we should have pre-reserved. Not good I was going to pay for my wife to come in with me. So we had to go find a place to eat and get some food which we did downstairs at the spinning wheel. Food was ok but a little overpriced the lounge would have worked out better value for us. Manchester airport needs to do something about the size of its lounges as if paying customers can not access them then there is lost revenue there for the airport.

A proper rip off, all facilities are (and are in other countries!) in the huge airport taxes and fees that are included in the airline ticket price. When arriving to this rip off airport, all travellers should have a pound or euros to get a trolley - what about people arriving from other countries? This is a basic requirement at an airport and many people arrive without local currency. Also it's a fee, not a deposit. The drop off is timed to the second, if there are any delays exiting (for example a car in front of you) the charge rises steeply. It's very easy to take over 180 seconds! The pick up is dreadful! There is zero provision for passengers despite the excessive charge. The waiting area is an open area without any shelter and full of puddles when it rains. It's the worse experience of the UK for travellers arriving. Again there is a charge, currently £4 for 30 minutes. However, the driver must get out of the car as you can't pay it at the barrier, thus wasting more time and different (and confusing) to the drop off process. The terminal shops are over priced and greedy and all travellers are routed (Ikea style) through a long path through a rip off ""duty free"" store - very frustrating when you are in a rush! Wifi is limited to just 1hr, and charged after that. In this day and age most other airports I've every been to around the world include wifi as standard without a time limit. All in all, enough is enough. Despite living in Manchester and taking 50+ flights a year I'll go out of my way to avoid this greedy airport in future. For those in North Manchester, Leeds Bradford Airport doesn't make drop off and pick up charges, is well connected to European hubs and much better organised.",1.0
428,"As a Mancunian I should be proud of the airport which serves the city. I am not - it is a shameful disgrace and an embarrassment to all Mancunians. I travel widely and the airport is the worst of the 60 or so I have used. The chaos at security, passport control and baggage is a joke. The place is filthy. The staff are surly at best and the airport seems to be staffed by people who failed CSE Art, are on minimum wage and resent every moment of their working day. The management must be the most inept in the UK not to be personally embarrassed by the place. Do yourself a favour - avoid at all costs. Use BHX or even Liverpool - both of which are infinitely better run - and as a Mancunian it hurts to say that.",1.0
429,"We (a party of 4) had the misfortune to fly from this airport, to Rome on the 30th August 2018. We had stayed in the Radisson Hotel and used the walkway to Terminal 1. We had then to use a lift to ground level and take a very congested, long walk to check in. We had fast track through security so that was not bad. We felt sorry for the people in the normal queue in this very claustrophobic and very crowded building. After running the gauntlet of “Duty Free”, by the way lots of things cheaper on the high street! Our party finally arrived at the Departure Lounge, what can I say, how can I describe this “hell hole”. Crowded to the point of not being able to move without pushing or brushing past someone else. No seating to be had anywhere. Most of it being taken by people swilling coupious amounts of alcohol at 0600 hours. What food outlets there are, sell overpriced junk food. The shortest wait was at Burger King. What we did get there was disgusting and I will be contacting them directly to address that problem. Overall, a truly appalling place to start a holiday. How can Manchester Airport be proud of this, not fit for purpose terminal? In contrast our return journey out of Rome Airport was a pure delight. I suggest you send a management team to Rome to see how an airport should be run!",1.0
430,"Ridiculous that there is no free drop off or pick up at all, not even a few minutes. Just a money making scam! Security can only be described as chaotic. My belongings ended up in three different trays so it was impossible to keep an eye on them all. When I arrived home I found that the two new sealed packets of cigarettes were no longer in my hand bag, and that Manchester Airport's ""24 hour help line, 7 days a week"" is actually open from 9 to 5. Very litttle seating in the lounges, not much in the way of shops, and over £8 for an average glass of wine when you can finally get served, and the gate numbers come up really late even though they must know where each plane is going from long before. Outward from Southend was excellent, return from Manchester was awful.",1.0
431,"Only a review of T3 at Manchester airport. What a complete joke the check in process is, there are no machines to self check in, the Flybe website decided to go down on the morning of my flight so no chance of retrieving via my phone using my online booking code. Too many people being fed through security with not enough counters open, understaffed, and the priority line just ended up joining with a standard queue. Took 55 minutes to get through which at LHR or LGW or most airports would only take 15-20 minutes. I can't comment regarding T1 or T2 on this occasion but I'm not traveling from here again in a rush. The airport senior management clearly don't care, this could be so much better with some real thought and investment.",1.0
432,"Reading previous reviews it seems we were lucky with our experience at Manchester airport. We arrived at terminal 2 by taxi at 4.30 a.m. and had to queue to weigh our cases and drop them off with Tui. We went straight to security and didn't have to queue at all there. Admittedly the staff at security are not the friendliest creatures on our planet but we were soon through, even though I was one of the random people being given a more thorough search on that particular morning! Having gone through the duty free shop we found that the restaurant areas were very busy, so we returned to the cafe near Boots and WHSmith. We were able to get seats at the gates and were soon walking down the new corridors to board our plane which left on time. Coming home, we didn't have to queue at passport control and, after a little wait for our luggage were soon on our way. Our taxi driver was waiting for us. We have used this airport regularly - as well as many others in different parts of the world - and have never had a problem. I think it often depends on the time of day you travel and your expectations. We would always choose to be dropped off and collected by our own pre-booked taxi as it makes life so much easier.",7.0
433,"Manchester airport gets worse every time we go. When we went to go through security two members of staff were talking to each other ignoring customers then told us to go to the far end as the main security was not working. That was a very long queue up and down stairs in and out of barriers, to get through security it took just under one hour. Its not a good start to your holiday. When you get though that there is not enough seating. Toilets are dirty and smelly. The service in the restaurants is very slow. All Manchester airport say we are improving the airport, they need to put more staff on security! We live about 5 miles from the airport but will be looking at Liverpool in future.",1.0
434,"What a disgusting arrival now these new charges are in, dropping off no problem but trying to get a taxi to pick you up is like pulling teeth as we were told by the taxi driver eventually, the system is not working, we could see for ourselves arriving back at terminal 1 was complete chaos! The meet and greet was frantic and queues to get out long, who ever has come up with this plan mustn't of been anywhere where this system is working, drivers have to get tokens and pay first and that is if you can actually find one working. We actually thought our driver had run off because he was gone ages, I can understand sometimes things have to be changed but surely it must be changed for the good of smooth running at times when people are anxious, tense and just want to get home! Now found out you cannot pick up at the train station but can drop off, cannot see what difference it makes, dreading our next arrival back, puts a damper on your holiday. Hopefully some sense will be used as it is embarrassing to anyone arriving to this country for the first time, I know there is Arrow taxis but they have some connection to the airport but obviously not enough cabs as we went to them first and it was at least an hour before one was available. The black cabs are expensive and hate it when you are only going a short distance as we have been on the receiving end of that, so all in all its a nightmare and it needs sorting to accommodate passengers arriving.",1.0
435,"Manchester Airport is one of those airports you know you may have a hard time. Even if it is great the train station is at the airport, the connection between the train station and the terminals is really annoying: you need to go up go down walk some distance etc. But as I know this, I always arrive early enough. It is however difficult to find trains when you need to go early at the aiport (so I took a night bus) or when you leave late from the airport. Most of times, I arrive at the waiting area when the gate is not yet displayed. The waiting area is just horrible: crowded in the middle of the terminal, not all seats have a decent view of the monitors. My plane got delayed, and information on the displays was not up to date. And lastly, I really do not understand how can the airport make people pay for a lugguage trolley? That is absolutely disgusting!",4.0
436,"Completely over crowded every time I come to T3. Litter everywhere and very long queues in every single outlet. Nowhere near enough seating for the number of travellers. Terminal 3 really let's Manchester airport down. I've travelled to over 40 airports across the world and this is by far the worst Terminal I have ever been to. Need expanding, redesigning or simply a big increase in the number of staff. Staff are friendly and work hard. Just not enough of them.",3.0
437,"As a frequent traveller across Europe and worldwide, this is by far one of the worst performing airports I have ever been to. I have been to T1 twice this year, and have had close family also in T2. Parking is limited and very expensive, transportation to the airport any other way is not clear and often cancelled from the centre. Security is an absolute mess. Staff are customer facing and yet are absolutely horrible to customers. I understand that people are constantly forgetting to take out liquids etc but if your job requires you to deal with people and you are being paid to do so, you cannot act horribly. More so, are they so inefficient that the whole process just falls apart. They make you put every item separately (instead of, for example, in every other airport I've been to, electronics in one box with liquids, accessories in another with smaller bags) so that you end up with 7 boxes going through the x-ray machine. This means that the back log is so rammed that you're waiting for a very long time. If your bag gets pulled up, they purposely make you wait 45 minutes to teach you a lesson (I'm serious!). Family had loose wires in a bag (headphone cable and iphone cable) they then screened and lectured them. There are no requirements on cables. Observed elderly couples who were confused by the whole process again be lectured and forced to wait 45 minutes through security even though there were no other bags to be screened. Terminal has some decent shops, however it is very small and you may struggle to find a seat at peak times. Restaurants are very poor performing (Giraffe - the slowest waiters, had to leave when they took 30 minutes to even ask me If i wanted to order) and also fast food is generally very slow. Bring your own if you can. Other than that, its alright, but give yourself ample time for security. There is a reason why they are voted one of the worst airports in the world, and it most definitely is caused by terrible staff.",3.0
438,"Absolutely disgraceful airport, shame on you Manchester! Shame on you UK! After a long flight from Australia I was disgusted with the service.

This is what happens when there is no competition and you have a captive passenger pool. But I would avoid this airport if Liverpool is a viable alternative.",2.0

Nowhere to sit at all in terminal 3 or anywhere other than WH Smiths to get something to eat.

They both fit and there wasn't even room for another tray! Upon return we had a one hour wait before any luggage appeared due to a Swissport ""lack of resources"".

Using the lift we arrived at the floor we required and the doors would not open, we decided to go back down and thankfully the doors opened, we then went up the stairs and were told that they had been reported 2 days ago but was the responsibility of the airport to put ""an out of order"" notice on it to no avail. On arrival back in the UK It was even worse. After leaving the plane we the had to walk for at least 20 minutes with the moving walkways not working. After queuing for another 1O minutes at Passport Control then down more stairs to baggage collection, another wait for an hour before cases came through. The toilets whilst waiting for cases had not been cleaned, absolutely disgusting filthy, very unhygienic, I had to go into 7 cubicles to find the least dirty to use, needed closing down. Our taxi driver could not collect us at the normal pick up point, we had to go up a floor and then the two lifts were not working so had to carry heavy suitcases up the stairs. As he had to wait for us he had to pay an absorbent amount of money for parking. Visitors must get a terrible impression of our country on arrival. I will never hopefully have to us this outdated, dirty airport with miserable, unhelpful staff again.",2.0

446,"A visitor arriving at Manchester airport would be forgiven for thinking they'd landed in the airport of a much less significant city. The buildings are poorly maintained rabbit warrens of corridors in a jumbled mess. The exception to this, of course, are the duty free shops, which have had more than their fair share of make-overs and revamps to line the MAG pockets. Most staff have a bad attitude, giving paying passengers the impression that they are little more than an inconvenience. Baggage reclaim takes an age, apart from the solitary bag they send through so they've hit their target. Then you'll wait another 30 minutes for the rest of the bags to arrive. Pickup and drop-off parking at the airport is simply daylight robbery. The airport has spent tens of thousands of pounds 'reducing congestion' by increasing charges and heralding a free drop-off area. However, you can't pick up from this area. The airport managers would rather let the buses go back to the drop-off area empty, because they want people to use the paid areas. £4 for 1 minute, 34 seconds parking was my last receipt - that's £160 per hour equivalent.

Having moved from London two years ago when I would travel from both Heathrow and Gatwick regularly I have since had to travel from Manchester. And my word how far behind it is! My recent holiday was a good example of how poor it is. This review is based on a journey during summer holidays so it will be busy which I appreciate there are more people travelling, but some of these issues are just unacceptable. The security queues are a joke. To be shouted at the whole 45 mins that you are in the queue is unacceptable. I can’t think of a worse way to start a holiday. Other than the stress of finding a parking bay to be dropped off in and be charged for the pleasure of it! Multiple customers needing to be pulled out of the security queue due to them missing their boarding times. But of course, at Manchester airport, if you fancy paying then no problem. In addition, the airport is filthy dirty. I took my 5 year old into the ladies toilets at 6am to be met with an over flowing sanitary bin! Not a pleasant sight for him or me. Come on Manchester airport! This is disgusting. On the return this week unfortunately it was no better. Passport queues were marginally better than I’d experienced last time but arriving into T1, no one seemed to be able to tell me where the “pick up area or designated place” was. This included the info desk who told me it had all been changed three weeks ago! Well congratulations on completely screwing it up. This resulted in us needing to catch the tram one stop to eventually find the person who had been trying to collect us! Next time I will be travelling from Liverpool.

459,"It is the 6th time that I've travelled from this airport because this is my home town for the time being. I can say that this is the worst airport I have been so far in my entire life. Staff are rude, cleaning service is below average, baggage comes one hour after flight lands and all this in the busiest airport in the UK (after the London airports). For the last 3 flights, I used Leeds Bradford airport which is much smaller, only an hour by train from Manchester and thankfully is much more business minded and quick. As for Manchester, here's what happened today. Last time I departed from Manchester, the Uber dropped me in the new drop-off area as Manchester has enforced a £3 pounds minimum fare for everyone that wants to get in the terminal area. After they drop you off, you can get the free (thankfully) shuttle bus to drive you to the airport (which takes 10 minutes in normal time). Today, we arrived with a 2-hour delay from my destination, we arrived at 00:39 and got our luggage at 01:10. I was searching for the shuttle drop off bus but there are no signs at terminal 3 and so I was waiting for 10 minutes there. I asked 2 bus drivers who did not know that bus and in the end, thankfully I went to terminal 1, where the bus had previously dropped me. I finally found the driver who told me that this is the staff bus and could not take me (for crying out loud, there is a dedicated staff bus for the same place but not for the 25 million passengers that the airport handles). Thankfully, the driver has showing understanding and let me in. The moment we arrived, he dropped me in the drop off area where I tried calling again an Uber cab. Then the good part started: The security guard told me that there this is only a drop off place and not a pick up place. So I had to go back to the airport and call for a cab there. Finally I went back to terminal 1 (after 30 minutes had passed) and yes, the management had succeded; I did not use an Uber cab but instead I used their private taxi service paying 25% more. Definitely I would have used the train to go to Manchester centre but as it was 1 am and everything was shut, I had no choice. It seems like the taxi drivers lobby won there.",1.0

465,"What a rough airport. I arrived and departed through this airport, both unpleasant experiences, specifically with departure as I was there the longest. Before you get in it there are no signs for the departures carpark in T2 (only arrivals), after circling a few times we got in and realised there was only 1 car park for either. Not the best carpark as the lines have been repainted (badly) again and again, with an elderly father, finding the (unsigned) disabled parks was a joke. Then you head to the (dirty) lifts and look for your floor which is labelled A, B, C rather than the number system that the rest of the entire world uses - e.g. 1st floor, 2nd floor. After checking in (easy - Qatar Airways), there is a lack of obvious places to have a quick chat with anyone you’re leaving behind so basically you head straight in without saying bye (or spending any money). Then you are continually shouted at about the same message (no liquids etc) as you head to disorganised queue after queue. Seriously, I was shouted at with full volume for 20 minutes as if it’s something no-ones ever heard or we are complete idiots. Amazingly for all the security, I did the whole checking in thing with a hat on and wasn’t once asked to remove it? When you finally make it through to the secure area, it’s pretty standard except for a constant grubbiness and general dirtiness of everything you look at. Even the cafes had rubbish piled on the clearly un-wiped tables. I’m not a clean freak but I felt dirty just being there. Every corner of the floor has a build up of dirt and dust, with chewing gum stuck to floors and everything looking very tired. Lots of signs showing off about spending £1B to upgrade the experience. The airport should spend £1B on cleaning instead as it's really disgusting - I've been to tiny islands with very basic airports, but they're still clean and feel nicer overall than this.

The new drop off charge, allegedly to reduce congestion, has actually increased congestion and has proved itself to be the money-grabbing exercise we suspected. The cheapest pick up charge of £4 for 30 minutes is difficult to achieve as it's entirely dependent on bags coming through speedily, otherwise the charge goes up to £6.50 for an hour.

468,"Shocking from start to finish. I'll start by saying this airport is apparently doing everything it can to wring every last penny out of the traveller. We arrived as a couple having done everything possible to avoid any unnecessary stress, paid for valet parking (all good but £139 for 3 weeks on a deal) priority check in and fast track security (part of the airline ticket upgrade). It started off well, valet parking as planned and fast check in done as promised. Fast track security? No chance, with a security hall the size of most hangers it seemed about 3 machines were operational (apparently the screening contractors organised a mass sick day). The queue for screening was almost out the door with staff calling people from the middle of this mass of bodies for flight boarding already. Once through, the departure lounge was crowded, food concessions expensive with no option to buy any food or drink tax free (except for boots). Returning, we had the addition of a Special assistance passenger, so would have hoped for a better experience, especially as there would be no security to go through. I guess assumption really is the mother of all. We arrived on time, but had to leave the SA passenger on board as the aircraft was being handled on the apron rather than the air bridge. So, it's down the stairs, across the ramp, into the building, up the stairs, along the corridors, up some more stairs, along more corridors, down more stairs, follow the signs to arrivals only to be directed 100 yards the wrong way to join the queue for passport control. Approximately 45 minutes later after god knows how far we'd walked through the snaking queuing ""system"" we get to the E passport gates. OK finally, put in passport, quick facial scan, job done? Nope, it had issues reading a fair proportion of people who then got directed to the sole human that was processing under 12's and e-scanner rejects. My turn, I'm 6'2"", my passport says I am, so why does the machine start looking for my face at my navel? We're now up to over a hour from chocks but finally we're in reclaim, except there's no bags, also notably no elderly lady in a wheelchair! No panic, lets get a trolley first, well thats a pound or EUR 2, except I've just flown in on an international flight, so no euro or sterling coins on me, luckily, 2 of the 4 trolley blackmail devices take cards, well they would if they worked! Eventally found a pound coin in the bottom of my wife's handbag and released a trolly just as the conveyor started. This was followed by the reappearance of the aforementioned SA passenger who we discovered had been forgotten, along with 2 other wheelchair users and left at the arrival gate. When remembered, it was left to a single porter to ferry them to passport control then reclaim (stairs remember) in a weird sort of reverse relay race. If you can, give this place a miss.",1.0
469,"Terminal 3, arrived 2 hours before our flight. Ryanair queue was humungus taking over the full terminal. Over 1 hour for baggage check in, I only had children car seats to tag, why can't they do it at the gate as they do with the hand luggage? Not enough staff to deal with it. So if you have to go through the check in desk please go as early as possible. Once done we had to rush through, no time for a drink or even to buy a bottle of water as was the last call for our boarding",4.0

Now I have started going to Liverpool airport and what a difference. Would highly recommend.

Security is important we all know that.",1.0

She was in considerable pain when she arrived at the end. This is completely disgraceful.",1.0

475,"I have been using this airport for the last 45 years. It was never the best experience but with every day that passes Manchester Airport becomes a more unpleasant travel experience. New depths have been plumbed since the introduction of the new rip-off drop off charge. Check-in is variable, dependant on which carrier you are travelling with. Security is chaotic. The shops are poor, the food and drinks vendors even worse. There is insufficient seating and the general air is of ""couldn't care less"". The whole public areas is grubby and the toilets stink. On my last trip my suitcase was completely destroyed by the baggage handling staff prior to being loaded on the aircraft. (It was bound up with masking tape to enable it to loaded on the aircraft). Arrival is not much better. No steps were available for our aircraft for 15 minutes on our arrival. The bus journey from the plane to the terminal building took another 15 minutes. The queues to go through passport control are lengthy and the UK Border Control staff seem to have been selected for their rudeness.You can often wait more than 30 minutes at the baggage carousel for your luggage. All in all a dreadful experience whether departing or arriving.",2.0
476,"Can’t believe the current lack of organisation on the car parks. Went to pick someone up at T1 today. Eventually found a space on the car park and once I had met the people I went to pay. Big queues for the machines especially as one wouldn’t accept cards. Taxi driver said it never does so obviously a long term fault. Been there less than 1/2 hr so my charge showed as £4. Unfortunately didn’t have enough cash. Nipped outside and got cash off my wife, just enough between us. Put my token back in, now £6.50. Guy on the intercom reduced the fee when I explained. None of the barriers were working to get off the car park, complete chaos. They were eventually raised to allow everyone out, paid or not. Traffic trying to get into the airport was affected and was log jammed up to the motorway roundabout. Two weeks ago when I went it was queued back all the way down the motorway spur to the M56 main carriageway. I can see why they now charge for drop off but the idea was it would improve traffic flow around the airport! Not sure what on earth has gone wrong. I use the airport every month on average as well as picking people up in between. What was reasonably well organised is now chaotic. When I come to book next years flights I will use Liverpool where possible. Hope easyJet carry on flying to Turkey from a Liverpool as that will be my first choice. I understand that the development needs to take place but car park organisation, surrounding roads and passport control are now appalling. Avoid the airport like the plague until they get their act together.",1.0

478,"28th June 2018. Having used Manchester airport on numerous occasion, it was once again my choice to use this airport on this occasion for a wonderfully planned holiday to the Maldives. Having used the airport lounges at Manchester where the service was superb, I booked 4 spaces on this occasion to relax and unwind from the journey to the airport. Thus setting us up for a nice relaxing time. We had a bad experience in October 2017 but I put this down to teething problems in security which took us ages to get through back then. Foolish me should have learned my lesson then. I was asked to unpack my diving regulators from my hand luggage and the looks I got clearly indicated that 98% of the security staff had no idea what they were looking at. So we set off on the morning of the 28th June allowing ourselves 4 hours to get through check in where we simply had to do a baggage drop and move on to security. This still allowed us more than ample time to enjoy our 3 hours including allowing for boarding time in the airport lounge. Knowing that this is an arduous task we (4 of us) kept our hand luggage to an absolute minimum. Joy oh joy then the fun started. Arrival at security 'if you can call it that' I thought the war had arrived on our shores and was taking place in the security hall. Staff were shouting at each other complaining about the amount of work they had to do and no one was helping the other. So lets break this down: 1. Passengers made to stand for almost an hour before getting sent to a conveyor 2. Staff shouting at each other 3. Staff complaining lack of help and support 4. Female member of staff shouting at the passengers telling them to make sure they had all their stuff sorted before getting checked. 5. Female member of staff shouting at the top of her voice to get someone to scan an elderly gents walking stick. 6. About a quarter of the conveyor belts and x ray in use to check passengers luggage. 7. Numerous members of security staff standing about doing nothing and looking at others battling. 8. Due to number of passengers in the area it was extremely hot and uncomfortable. 9. No security members of staff smiled. It was like attending a funeral of someone you despised. 10. 2 of 4 bags separated for security check. This after security was asked if they wanted me to remove my scuba regulators once again prior to going through the x ray machine. Time to find someone to search the bag around 25 minutes. Not as bad as the elderly gent waiting for his walking stick that must have been around 40 minutes. 11. Wife had her bag searched and they found a tiny tub or tube of lipsil that no one even knew was there. So all in all with more than 3 .5 hours to spare at the start of security, we landed up with a grand total of less than 40 minutes to spend in the airport lounge that had been pre-paid for. We only had the 40 minutes as we were the last to board the plane prior to doors closing and well on time. I mentioned the airport lounge cost, a security guard turned around and said that we should have thought and allowed more time. Upon our return to Manchester airport following a stunning holiday, we disembarked the plane and started to make our way to arrivals. Low and behold only to be met by a locked door where we kept waiting squashed into a corridor for about 30 minutes. No explanation. So all I can say is a big thank you (not) to the horrible moody ignorant and useless security staff.",1.0
479,"Shocking. Herded like cattle into unpleasant security check area. Staff bored, uninterested and rude.

Will do everything not to use this airport again.",1.0
480,"Absolute chaos, overcrowded and horrendous. The security system is an absolute joke, almost 2 hours to get through and only just got our flight. While I understand the need for security, the system they have in place is a complete mess. I certainly will be looking for a different regional airport for my next holiday.",1.0
481,Paying to drop off at Manchester airport is outrageous and a further form of taxation. It should be dropped instantly. Recent changes to processing through security have had little impact and travellers are expected to descend and climb stairs to and from a basement. The procedure in case of a fire/bomb attack is unclear and passsengers are underground. The whole experience is dreadful - much could be learned from a visit to Gatwick South Terminal. A full review of passenger experience should be carried out.,1.0
482,"I have to say as many before me, that the security staff are rude. I went through the security check and was stopped as the machine showed hot spots. Now considering we are having the hottest summer in years, it was not surprising I was warm! I'd just driven to the airport and dragged a heavy case to be dropped off! However, the woman kept putting that machine up and down and up and down me. For one thing I find being man handled by a woman a little off putting to say the least. But I would like to be informed what on earth she was looking for! I had a t shirt loose fitting trousers and sandals apart from my underwear. What I am supposed to be hiding under my armpit is a mystery to me. Then as I raised my eyebrows to my friend waiting for me (after the fifth time of having the machine waved up and down me) she said my body language was aggressive. I am a mature lady and do not appreciate being spoken to, as if I was a school child. This isn't the first time that I have found the staff to be rude, on other occasions it has been about the plastic bags! They do have a job to do I appreciate that, but good manners goes a long way to getting people to co operate. When arriving at the aiport people are naturally anxious and they need to realise this. We are not all terrorists neither are we criminals trying to smuggle good etc.",1.0

The result (again) queues and inconvenience and, of course, no managament available for a discussion on (the total absence of) customer service. I feel for the staff who (generally) are courteous and helpful but it's easy to see that the operation is (majority) owned by local authorities. Incompetent management who are unable (unwilling?) to resolve the problems and, in exchange for increasing amounts of customer money, deliver decreasing amounts of customer satisfaction.

489,How much more money can this airport take off customers. Experienced the new departure payment £3 for 5 minutes. Yes 5 minutes. I just feel that Manchester airport will do anything for that extra quick cost. It cost us £160 return in a taxi plus the drop off charge as it started the day we travelled. The airport itself is expensive to eat and drink. Coming back I generally felt like I was in a cattle market. I understand they want to get you through quickly and safely as possible. But you now have blue metal gate stands on your way to passport control. It’s taking all the fun out of going on holiday. All these suggestions need reviewing why does it have to be so expensive and the drop off fee is ridiculous.,3.0

A lot of European airports have free drop off and work far more efficiently than Manchester.",1.0
491,"I’ve never really given much thought to how the airports in developed countries have been functioning. Now I’m thinking the reason behind that is that they were indead functioning. For the first time I’m baffled. I thought I was at an airport in the middle of nowhere in Central America or something, but even they know how to run an airport better. First thing that hit me was the 10-15min walk from the train station to the actual terminal. Bad news if you've got kids running about, lots of luggage, or just struggle walking in general. I entered the airport and came upon a screen telling me where to check in, all fine. Finding the check-in numbers 50-80? Good luck. The arrows will point you anywhere but where you want to go. Then you have to go through security. Huge lines that never ends, even though we’re not that many. It went so slow. Plastic bags for liquids were at the entrance, but they shuffle you into the queue without giving you one or pointing out that you will have to get your bag ready before actually entering the queue. The staff were aggressive and rude, and I saw no reason for why. I get that things have to be a certain way, but I fly often, and have never come across such millitary perfection to how the bags shall lay in the boxes they offer you. If you get it wrong, there are loads of signs telling you in capital letters, you’ll have to wait 30 minutes for hand seaeching if you’re unable to properly screen your bags. Once you actually go through security, you’d normally be checked, then go wait for your luggage to arrive after scanning. Not in Manchester. I had 5 minutes of panic when the box containing my liquids and expensive (and open to the public to nick) electricals didn’t turn up. I expected it would have to be hand searched and asked where I should wait for it. They pointed me towards the packing desks, and there it is. They’ve moved it away from the area just to clear the space. Anyone could take my things. While I was packing it away, I saw several others freak out over lost phones and laptops. Get travel insurance before you go! After getting inside to the lounge, there’s no seating apart from the restaurants available, and nowhere to charge my phone which has my app-ticket. I’m also being rained on, as the ceiling is dripping down from the rain outside. There are no bins anywhere, so litter is floating about on the floor everywhere. Shame for such a beautiful city to have this airport. Not coming back unless I absolutely have to! Go to Liverpool airport instead, spend £5 and 30 minutes more and save yourself the stress.",1.0
492,"Having read countless negative reviews about service levels at Manchester, I wanted to put forward my observations. On arrival into T2 on Singapore airlines I was dreading lengthy immigration queues, but was through in a few minutes on UK passport, baggage arrived quickly and soon boarded bus to car hire village. Departing 2 weeks later we stayed in the onsite Radisson Blu hotel, 2 minute walk to T2. Check in smooth and efficient once they figured how to check bags through Singapore when we had a 24 hr transit (deliberate!) The dreaded security screening loomed. Yes a fair bit of surly staff, shouting about liquids etc, which we had sorted, told to get ipads out, bags screened quickly, through metal detector, job done-probably the quickest I've ever been through security anywhere. If you are prepared then it was smooth, otherwise lots of bags going for extra screening.

496,If you are traveling into Manchester terminal 2 with children under 12 years then you are in for a very unpleasant experience.

This will result in you being forced into the Family holding pens as your children under 12 are not allowed to use the new e reader machines. Here you will be made to queue for over an hour whilst a small number of immigration officers check passports. We were there yesterday 11th July and it was horrible. Dozens of tired and restless children forced to stand for an hour. By the time we were halfway to the front all the ‘adults’ had cleared the machines - deserted!

Queues snaking around corridors and down stairs, no information and taking up to an hour just to reach the security barriers. It is as if the last thing they expected was for people wanting to travel turning up. Some security staff could easily have gained employment as East German border guards, barking instructions at travellers as they endeavour to navigate the ever-changing rules. The ground staff take the view that this is a money grab. More flights added, more money squeezed out of captive passengers but no investment in staff or resources.

Being dropped off at T3 now costs, the security is awful and took forever and I'm from Northern Ireland, so I'm used to it. The distances that we had to walk within the terminal, late notification of gates, climbing up and down steps with luggage.

You have to pay extra to drop off near the terminal. 2) They are always understaffed at the security checks and passport controls. I literally spend a minimum of 2 hours every time I fly through the airport. Last time I was there, there were three queues which were overflowing outside the T1 for security checks. Of course you can pay extra to go through quicker. 3) They've designed the duty free area in such a way that it's like a labyrinth of obstacles before you can get to your actual gate. It's almost a challenge to knock all those stands with perfumes and alcohol. Again you can pay to avoid this. (You can see a pattern emerging with this approach). If you can avoid this airport, do.

First they didn't have our gate ready. So we had to spend an extra 20 minutes on the runway. Once we got off the airplane there was very poor signed and no airline reps to tell you where to go. After speaking to some other we figured it and proceeded to get crammed in like sardines into a bus to go to another terminal. Once at the new terminal they had you walk up stairs with all your carry ons only to be queued into another line to go through security again. Mind you we just got off a 747 with lots of passengers. They only had 1 security line open and the people running it were so disorganized and slow. Others in line feared they were going to miss their connections. We must have waited 45 minutes here. Once finished with security we were queued into this very bizzare system of ropes that even the guy running it didn't know what to do. We were let in one rope to pickup tickets for our connecting flight. Then we had come back out of those ropes into another queue for passport control. Finally had to figure out which door to exit through. Next we had to walk through a series of narrow hallways. Finally to a main open area. Then we had to find our gate and go through another set of doors but with this set there was very little signage and 1 guys working on a queue of 100 people looking to exit. Finally up more steps and down another hallway and we were at our gate. The plane was at the end of boarding. The gate agent said ""Where have you guys been? You arrived two hours ago."" Next we had to walk down more steps only to be queued again. Nobody at the bottom to help us. We had to walk back up the stairs to find out what we were supposed to do. Finally we were let out to walk to the aircraft. My wife and I are world travelers and have never had such a poor experience at the airport.",1.0

Left my mum in the wheelchair and went to given in the bag at the other collection desk. After finishing this, I went back to get my mum in the wheelchair, took her to the area where they collect wheelchair passengers and waited there for 30 mins again. Stern, unfriendly looks again. Cost £9.50 parking for the 1hr 50min privilege and the £1 for the baggage trolley. When you park, rather than the 1st floor parking being for disabled customers, thery were for ""premium"" customers. So parked 3 floors above and no trolleys near where we parked and to find the trolley and take mum. Inconsiderate, don't think about customer experience and money grabbing.

Worst of all is the security staff who seem to very much enjoy the power they are given, you have to shuffle along stressfully taking shoes and belt off while pressurised from the queue to hurry, if you make one mistake you are treated like a criminal. Up in arrival there is always a very large queue and sometimes we are forced to use these  scanning machines were you are herded in like a sheep.

507,"I worked at Manchester Airport for 14 years and travelled from it since the 70s. Last year I booked a car parking space at T1 long Stay. On arrival I found it difficult to find a parking space and the shuttle bus driver seemed to be ignoring us, so we walked to the terminal. On return, It was difficult to manoeuvre my car out of the parking space because of vehicles parked behind me on the road, which obviously couldn't find a space either. This year I decided to take a taxi to the airport, as this proved marginally cheaper. The taxi driver was bemoaning the introduction this month of charges for dropping off travellers and informed us that M/A now charge for baggage trolleys which is not refundable. He further complained that the reconstruction of road network was confusing (and he is there almost every day). I confirmed with him that since I worked there from 1992 and it has been an on going project, but it only seems to get worse rather than better. If the chaos of the road system was bad, it was nothing compared to the chaos in the terminal. There is obviously insufficient security staff as testified by the long slow moving queues. I had purchased a plastic see through toiletries bag from Boots which contained miniature toiletries but I was asked to transfer them into another see through plastic bag, which helped to cause further delay to other travellers. Why is one clear bag different to another? On previous visits my wife has carried her hair straightener in her hand luggage but this time she was told in a condescending way that there are signs saying it should be removed from the case, and her case was taken out of view for further examination. As I was placing my belt etc in the tray for the x ray machine my passport and boarding card were grabbed out of my hand and placed in the tray. As I was being search by a security officer he was telling me how unhappy the staff were, due to altered shift patterns, nothing new for Manchester Airport. Once inside terminal 3 departures I was surprised at how many people were there. The place was really uncomfortably crowded with insufficient seating and difficulty moving around. This terminal was never designed to accommodate this volume of people. I don't know if I can blame M/R airport for this one or Ryanair but the flight was delayed and for about half an hour it was showing gate opening in five minutes. When the gate did open before we had got anywhere near the gate they were announcing final call for our flight which set my wife into panic mode. On arrival at the gate we were in a queue for about 15 minutes before any gate staff arrived, with inadequate seating at the gate. We were then ushered onto the stairwell and had to wait about ten minutes before boarding in very hot conditions. On our return journeey we passed through two airports and the clear toiletries bag we had purchased from Boots cleared security with no problem. When we arrived at T1 we were herded like cattle through a criss cross grid to the passport control. My experience of Manchester Airport is of a chaotic, money pinching, expensive nightmare.",1.0
508,I arrived at the security area and complied with the requests for all the checks. All except for not taking my handkerchief and credit card wallet from my trouser pockets. There upon the obnoxious security staff gave me the full treatment. I am 80 years old and I reckon that they owed me some respect. Nowhere on my travels have I witnessed such disgraceful behaviour. I will never be using this airport ever again.,1.0
509,"Many years ago this used to be a good airport, but then they discovered shops (full of stuff no-one needs) and filled the place with them, totally ignoring passenger gates, quiet areas etc. The accountants started to get a stranglehold over everything (chargeable, non-refundable trolleys for example, parking charges, and no doubt currently trying to work out how to make the loos a premium offer). So now it's the pits and a grubby pits at that. Security in Terminal 1 appears to be an exercise is how slow anyone can be while exhibiting the most passive-aggresive behaviours. Passport control on return to UK in T1 is designed to give you a taste of post Brexit hell. Interestingly the passport hall does contain the only water fountain I've ever seen in Manchester (I'm sure they're despised by the accountants because they're free and thus a reduction in the bottom line) However, all is not lost as far as they're concerned, because it's behind a security tape efficiently patrolled - apparently by a former member of the Stasi whose chief role is to keep you in the endless queue for the border. Luggage appears to come through quickly, mostly because your mind has overlooked the 30 - 40 mins you've spent in the queue for passport control. Meet & Greet (the confusing name for valet parking) works quite well but is in danger of becoming a victim of its own success. Never fear, the MAN accountants will soon fix that by pricing it out of the range of most normal people.",1.0
510,"Arrived in good time T1 for a 7.55 departure, 15th June. The T1 security queue was backed up out of security and snaked around various check in areas. It took 30 minutes of queuing just to get to the security entrance. Staff switched us to the ""fast lane"" however, even using the ""Fast Lane"" our security process took 50 minutes. Those in the normal queue 100 + minutes. It really is farcical at this airport. No way to prepare for a business trip. All the airside shops were empty as nobody had time to use them. The airport know how many flights there are, they know the passenger loadings and times but constantly fail to provide adequate facilities. The whole T1 experience is a dismal abysmal experience that is an embarrassment to the city. The place should be avoided until some action is taken. On return to MAN, only a few people had checked bags in, but these took over an hour to be delivered, in fact the aircraft had departed on the next sector before Manchester managed to deliver the bags. Under-resourced miserable place to travel to/from.",1.0

Then onto the waiting lounges which have rubbish on the floor, overfull bins and once again too many people. On my return back into Manchester, I am not greeted by a small line for passport control, such as other airports. But by a long, noisy wait, with no organisation at all. Please Manchester, just get new management.",1.0
513,"First of all arrival at the airport, I have German residency card with smartchip (EU) but with an Australian passport. I was not able to go through passport control with my German husband and he was so angry about it as the queue for non EU passports was about an hour long. If I can enter Germany with my chip card, why not the UK? It is still part of the EU last time I checked. I asked the controllers and the police at the desk, they all said I could not go through with my husband and he should have come with me to prove I was married to a German! Wait, what? Why? Then today on our return trip, we were directed to one security gateof disorganisation and extremely rude and cranky security people. Both my husband and I had to be patted down, he had to take his shoes off which last time we flew were fine. They were arguing with people and being condescending at a girl for putting a tub of lip balm through in her bag. It took over 45 minutes to get through which then magically closed in front of us. We were directed to a security place downstairs which was a total nightmare n there was literally no queue! Lucky our flight was delayed or we would have missed it for sure!

514,"Arriving back into Manchester from Corfu, I remembered why we don't like using Manchester Airport. Being herded by sheep springs to mind. The walk from the Easyjet gates is ridiculously long,with no moving walkways to assist those who find it difficult to walk far and prefer not to seek assistance. Then the queue to get through customs is also a lot of walking up and down the barrier areas before showing your passport, why can't there be more self scanners or staff to get you through quickly, the last thing you need after a long flight. Also why does it take so long to collect your baggage, again more staff would quicken this process. For a large international airport, why are there such delays, more people need to complain instead of putting up with the way things are run.",2.0

Airside it is still dire, crowded and unclean in the public areas. I was however using lounge access (Escape) so the overall experience was improved as I did not have to suffer the downstairs mess. However upon my return to T3 this morning it was a shambolic mess regarding passport control. Severely over crowded and cattle going to abbatoir would be better treated. Seriously 20+ minutes to get to passport control. Management need to address the comments on Skytrax unless of course they are aiming at the title of worst airport worldwide.",4.0
516,Arrived 1 hour and 40 minutes before a flight to Amsterdam. A huge queue at the security point. I was lucky to have a fast pass with my boarding card.

517,I have decided that no matter how cheap it is to fly from Manchester I'll never go here again. I've used all three terminals in the last year and thus time flew from Terminal 1.

No other airport in the UK or overseas is as bad. People need to vote with their feet to make this terrible airport change,1.0
518,"Now by far and away the worst airport experience anywhere. Disorganised, inefficient, unclean and badly maintained - as an international airport it is totally shambolic. Security is rude, arrogant and patronising and knowing someone personally who works in security at the airport the morale of the staff is rock bottom. Road access is now disrupted and delays are frequent. The car hire village is now best reached by foot (if hand luggage only) as the infrequent shuttle buses are stuck in the traffic chaos that has been created by a management decision seemingly to upgrade 3 terminals at once, and a new drop off charge is further fuelling anger. Train access is OK as long as this serves an onward journey but this is not an option for many. As a frequently (bi-weekly) traveller to/from Europe and Scandinavia I am now acutely embarrassed about Manchester Airport - it is a disgrace to the North West of the UK. Time that the relevant authority demand that a competent airport operator takes over and the current management is removed permanently.",1.0
519,"Absolutely disgusting! Check in process with most airlines out dated, too confined no queue management. Security a joke, so many bags rejected over silly things and then wait 40 mins for them to check that instant coffee is a security risk. The security staff have no idea of DFT & CAA guidelines, always asking a manager if its ok or not. Incredibly rude. Gates old and in poor condition, most of the airport now looks like a shed. Other travellers paying for long stay car park and then being put in staff car park which isn't fair. Asking you to pay for everything wouldn't be surprised if they ask you to pay to breathe next. Fast track is a joke, you wait around 20 mins just to get your liquids out. Unfortunately MAG you have managed to ruin what was once a nice airport. You have squeezed every passenger and airline for every penny they have! You have done minimal improvement to the airport apart from what your required to do by law. Your customer services staff don't even know what customer service is. You have made it less attractive for airlines and passengers to travel through your airport. Unfortunately you will never be a global gateway as all you want to do is make your shareholders profits happy and not improve the airport so that people will choose to fly from MAN. I personally would prefer to fly from another airport e.g AMS, MAD or even LHR. Well done Manchester!",1.0
520,"Flew to Rome on 4th June. Have used this place, albeit reluctantly for 30 years and it simply gets worse. I know that security has been hugely beefed up (for obvious reasons) over the last 10 years or so, but the chaos that ensues every time I come surely can be avoided. Other airports, i e N/Castle, Leeds/Brdfd, Glasgow and L/pool seem to cope ok! I consider my wife and me to be reasonably intelligent people but arriving in our car to park at Term 1/3 long stay was a nightmare. Large swathes of the area were under refurbishment/construction. Signage was sporadic or non-existent, in short, we spent ages trying to find the carpark which is fairly obvious normally, although, in fairness, we usually park elsewhere. Fearing I was developing dementia, I asked various staff members where to go? They said, they too get confused each day, as there is big construction work in progress. This was vindicated when we returned for our trip 11 days later to find the pavement leading to the carpark (which we had eventually found prior to our trip) had been shut off for re-surfacing. As we live over 2 hours drive from here, I shall endeavour to use an alternate airport in the future. Roll on Carlisle opening in September!",3.0

To get through security there was a massive queue that stretched the whole length of the terminal-without exaggeration, it was total mayhem. Luckily I had pre booked Fastpasses which gave us some head start but we waited an unacceptable length of time and just made it to the gate. I can honestly say that, as a frequent flyer, Manchester Airport has rapidly gone downhill with its service to customers, herding them around like cattle in queues that seem never ending. As a true, proud Mancunian I much prefer the short drive and to fly from Liverpool. On this occasion we did not have bags in the hold, thankfully, as baggage return times have increased significantly.",2.0
523,This has to be the worst airport I have ever travelled through. Every time I have departed from this airport I have had a bad experience. Today was no exception. The queue for security was an hour long and it snaked right through the checkin hall of Terminal 3 which is already cramped as it is. Our flight was then delayed by two hours. The information screen did not inform us of the delay and we relied on airport staff to update us. The train station is about half a mile from the Terminal itself which one must walk as there is no shuttle bus. Part of the walk incorporates an elevated covered gangway which is stifling hot. Everything about this airport is horrific. I'll be flying to Liverpool in future and getting the bus connection to Manchester.,1.0
524,"First of all we had to get to jetparks 3 to park our car but because of the road changes going on around the airport we were faced with a long traffic queue to get down to Style Road (this was about 12 mid day and our flight was at 3.15pm). Then we had to wait ages for a bus to come along because the buses were being held up by the same traffic chaos, and they were taking at least twice as long to make the round trip. When a bus eventually turned up there were too many people and some had to wait for the next bus. We flew from Terminal 1 with Jet2 and the signs to get to the check in desk were misleading. Having checked in the luggage we had to queue through security for almost an hour. The Terminal 1 layout is largely devoted to shops and eateries so you get funneled into quite a small sitting area which is totally inadequate - not everyone wants to eat / drink, but just to sit in comfort and peace, which is not possible in this unpleasant environment. We went to the smoking area and it was a disgrace - we are not animals and should not be treated like one. We are paying customers, just like anyone else and should be treated with respect and given a smoking area fit for purpose and pleasant to be in. We came out and had a drink at a nearby bar and the table was dirty and sticky. The eateries and shops are all over priced, presumably because of the rents charged by the airport - it is disgusting that customers are overcharged just because they have no where else to go and can not bring their own liquids.",1.0
525,"I travelled through terminal 1 on 1st June and it took over an hour to get through security. As mentioned in other reviews only about 50% of the available security gates were open. Once at security despite complying with all the hand luggage requirements my bag was pulled out to have a swab of the exterior. Unfortunately the swab machine wasn’t working so the staff were running over to another lane with several swabs in hand to test them. I’m not sure about the traceability of this process if something was found and legal proceedings were required. The woman next to me had her bag checked and swabbed because “it was full”. It seems that at least one person in every party gets stopped meaning no one gets through smoothly, and this level of scrutiny and security would be bearable if you hadn’t had to wait an hour. It is a thoroughly dismal and depressing process. I was travelling for business but there were many people going on holiday and it’s the worst start to their holidays. As others I had no time to get a drink, let alone shop, before heading to my flight. I returned from Berlin where there is a security lane at each gate and therefore only very short queues if at all. Manchester is my local airport and in recent years the excitement I used to feel about going to the airport has been replaced by dread and trepidation. I’m ashamed that this airport represents our area.",2.0

I did arrive early for check-in which is always advisable, there are good transport links to the airport though Rail link from Piccadilly or Metrolink, a little on the slow side. My first observation there were no self service machines for check-in as at many other airports including Gatwick, had to check in a desk which went very smoothly, the next stage was the difficult part, long queues at security moving at a snails pace and staff somewhat disorganised. In the confusion I left my liquids bag in my carry on luggage which was flagged for additional search, eventually got through and into the main airport area,fairly good choice of food and drink outlets. Flight slightly delayed due to technical problem but arrived at destination more or less on time.",4.0

528,"Manchester Airport desperately needs to raise its game. It's been getting worse now for a long time. Even with ""fast track"" security (an extra £5 if paid in advance), security times are generally dreadful. It seems that nobody in security has any sense of proportion - even with full body scanners, I get patted down every time. So many bags are rejected at x-ray that there seems almost no point trying to comply because your bag is going to end up in a 40 minute queue for unhurried staff to hand search it anyway. The airport is full of officious signs about no bags being allowed on escalators as well. Sorry, but it's an airport - that's what people do - work around it, just like every other airport in the world seems to. I travel through lots of airports very frequently for work and it seems to me that bags are rejected at Manchester security for very trivial reasons that seem more about point scoring than any real contribution to security (eg having forgotten to include a lipstick in a clear bag, not knowing that asthma inhalers at Manchester are considered to be liquids, a forgotten little sachet of ketchup). The bag rejection rate at Manchester consistently appears to be vastly higher than any other airport. I am a proud Mancunian and I want to feel proud of my local airport, but for quite some time, it's mostly made me feel ashamed. Its terrible service must be damaging the regional economy - the number of angry and bewildered foreign visitors I've seen there is very high. Some of them are bound to be making investment decisions. If senior managers at Manchester Airport want Tel Aviv levels of security, fair enough - the more secure in the air I am the happier I am, but they need to employ enough staff and equipment to make that possible without routine delays of 45 minutes or more. It seems like a very poorly managed business to me. Until it gets better, I shall continue to drive to Liverpool airport wherever I can and avoid Manchester.",1.0
529,"Experience similar to many already posted. T3 Security area chaotic. Waited 40mins with my 83 year old Dad to arrive at front of bag check queue. His bag was rejected, so we had to wait another 30 mins for the bag to crawl its way through the next screening process. Finally the bag was checked and we were told ""its not been photographed"", so back it went into the original queue. This time it exited without being rejected. During this process a set of house keys and belt were misplaced, so we then had to go to the lost luggage where both were eventually retrieved. Staff were polite and cordial, however procedure was hopeless, taking well over an hour to get through security. At one point thought medical assistance was going to be required for my Dad as he got more and more stressed as the flight departure time loomed large.

Then entry to the UK via a random walk past some bollards, a long walk through corridors, stopping at a barrier to have your photo taken, then on to the depressing central holding area (the hoovering of some of the dirt behind the terminals at Smith's while they were still being used a masterstroke I thought), then another walk to a corridor with not enough seats and the Manchester airport air of depressed dirt, scruffy signs on doors etc. Spent the entire time longing to get out of here.",1.0

Not all the lanes were open, instead the frustrated herded passengers were shouted at that it was in fact their fault for the queues (due to bags being rejected). Not one apology, not one smile, not one hint of good customer experience.

The management now forces people to use slow elevators having put barriers in front of escalators, and route to T3 forces to take elevators up and down several times.

We avoid it as much as possible. Terminal two is ok except for the security screening. Of all the airports i have visited, the security is the worst. I am of the opinion that queues are deliberately maintained to entice you to pay to fastrack. The fastrack queue is frequently slow so what's the point? There are ten lanes for screening and I have never seen more then six in use, even when busy. Of particular annoyance is the metal detector goes off randomly even if you have completely removed anything metal. This wastes everyone's time and could cause a cry wolf situation. Next time I'll wear sports trousers as it has no zipper to see what happens! There is a sign saying that if your bag is searched, you could be delayed by up to half an hour. Translation- If you miss your flight because your bag is stopped, too bad, and don't blame us. One occasion, after being delayed in traffic then by the disgraceful security queues, we had to sprint the slalom through the duty shop dodging shoppers idly perusing goods to get to the gate. Admittedly the airport in having a huge upgrade. Hopefully this will improve things and maybe get in the top 100. However I have seen in the artists images a sign saying ""Fastrack"" at the security entrance and the queue lines to concertina queues so I wonder if they wish to improve here. (My heart sinks.)

Very disappointed with layout of Departure Terminal - on passing through a very poor Security Checking Area (Staff rude and in no way smartly dressed or even professional looking). One Male Security Officer in Baggage Security - was overweight with trousers hanging down and shirt hanging out. We had to walk by this Officer and he clearly had a body odour problem. You are then made walk through a large Shopping floor area before reaching the Cafes and rest areas. This layout of Shops should be ideally approached from the other side of Cafes and rest areas.

549,"I lost my watch at security. I realised straight away. The security man helped me look for it but it wasn’t to be found. The man took my phone number and gave me a number to ring after 24 hours. I joked with him that at least my delay at going through security would give my friends a chance to get the drinks in. To cut a long story short, the wonderful security man found my watch and called me, when I didn’t answer my phone he came looking for me in the bar. So thank you and well udone to the Manchester terminal 3 security man. These staff have a difficult job of keeping us all safe. I for one appreciate what they do.",10.0

551,"It's a bit pointless repeating everything in all the previous reviews, so really there's only one thing you need to know about this place, if at all possible do not use Manchester Airport. Below is (breifly) my latest experience. We departed there Sunday the 13th of May. Poor signage to guide you to the underground concrete sweatbox that is now T1 security. It was packed with people queuing back up into the baggage drop off hall. We did everything properly, liquids in clear bag, belt off etc., etc., My bag was pulled for search due to tea bags inside (sailing holiday). Man asked ""what are these""? As it had already taken over an hour to get to this point, it took great willpower not to reply ""What do you think they are?"" Ironically, from a security point of view, if ever there was a place to create maximum carnage, then it is in this concrete bunker. Time from bag drop to being released into the shopping mall which doubles as Departure Lounge, 1 hour 35 minutes. Arriving back was a little better, but despite it being 20 past midnight, it was 25 minutes before the luggage carousel started.",1.0

554,Unfortunately I travel through this airport four or five times per year and it seems to get worse each time. The security on departure and scanning area are ridiculously crowded in oppressively hot conditions and with surly staff. The system on arrival of having to queue with hundreds of passengers is unacceptable. Surly staff and scanning machines not working as they should just add to the frustration. The impression is that the staff are not really in control of the situation and visitors to this country must think it is all a bit of a joke. The worst airport I have ever used.,1.0

556,"A miserable experience in corporate cheapness. Access to T1 departures from the railway station is chaotic - up and down in lifts with no clear signage about where to go. Check in was okay, but the cynicism started at security, which is a clear exercise in nickel-and-diming. All the signs point to the express (paid for) security lines, while the standard one is poorly signed (I was one of a dozen people who could not see where to go) down a rickety concrete staircase in a far corner of the hall. To call it third-world is a gross insult to developing-world airports. Standard security is in a tatty concrete undercroft - it looks suspiciously like a former staff car-park - herded along through cattle grids. Must say, the security staff were very good and helpful but at the far end there are more incomprehensible lifts, steps, ramps and locked doors to the main concourse. Then it's the march through the duty-free store, which is three times as big as it needs to be because everything is triplicated, in case you miss a chance to buy giant Toblerone. Everything feel designed to extract as much money as possible, as shoddily as possible. Manchester is a great city: its airport is a disgrace to it. One star, plus one for the nice staff.",2.0

Bus eventually left, at terminal building driver and colleague got out, looked around, seemingly confused, then eventually let us of the bus. Time from landing to getting in the terminal building 50 minutes. Passport control, in the process of using the scanners when all went blank, a member of staff called over to a colleague ""have you switched them off"". Then had to go through manual check, and the surly staff. This airport is a complete embarrassment to the people and city of Manchester. Until the Government forcibly removes the management and replaces them with those who have a concept of customer service nothing will ever change.",1.0
562,"Worst airport I have ever seen. At arrival, we had 1 hour queue to go through the passport control, hundred of people waiting. At the departure, there are no check in machines, so if you did not print your tickets or don't have a smartphone, you just have to queue with the people that have luggages and I can tell you the queue was not moving. Also, I have never seen a security system so bad. Almost every bag is taken aside for an extra check by personnel. So there is another queue of people waiting for their bag after security! We had to wait 20mins to have ours checked. Better come very very early! Afterwards you have to walk a very long distance, go down stairs, go up stairs, until you find your gate with very few seats. If you're old or with little children, too bad for you. It seems like everything is very old and outdated and too small for so many people. So be sure to be there at least 2 or 3 hours before your flight time and I would say at least 4 or 5 to go to the US (the queue was at least 500 meters yesterday). I can't imagine how it is must be in the summer! Well at least the staff are nice.",1.0
563,Worst security check system. I have never seen a security system work so inefficiently. Almost every single bag is taken aside for an extra check by personnel.

I came through customs today and was totally embarrassed to be British on an international arrival. The delays at customs cannot be just attributed to being careful as in other countries, this standard of service is not the normal. I mentioned my concerns to a member of staff and her response was “don’t come again”. Terrible experience Manchester and I’ve never ever before been compelled to write a review for anything.",1.0
569,I travel every week through Manchester Airport. I have been doing this on and off for the last 6 years. In this time I have noticed how pathetic the airport has become. I used to believe Charles De Gaulle was the was airport to transit through but Manchester easily surpasses it now. My comments relate particularly to Terminal 1 and 3. To start the road works around the airport cause you at least 1o minute delays just to get with site of the terminal. The new draconian enforcement of drop off / parking limitations can add another 20 minute just to get into the terminal. Manchester airport has decided to earn extra revenue by charging for drop off (planned for the very near future). Drop-off spaces is limited to approximately 20 cars for T3 and 15 for T1. This is woefully inadequate for an international airport of its size. Getting through security (T3) is a nightmare with queues often extending past the first barrier where you scan in your boarding pass. This is due to excessive bags / persons being stopped at the scanners. I do understand that many people do not separate their luggage as requested but many of the secondary checks (especially from the body scanners) reveal nothing. On occassion I have seen approximately every 2nd person being frisked with the wand. This can only mean that the machines are set on too sensitive a range. On arrival the ground staff are often late in getting the plane positioned at the stand with stairs to disembark. Last week we had to wait in the plane for 20 minutes while they towed a plane that was in the stand reserved for us. After that was done the ground crew did not remove the stairs that was blocking our stand causing an additional 10 minute delay. When returning through arrivals you can expect a long wait if more than 2 aircraft (let alone the A380 from Dubai) arrive at the same time. This can result in another 30 minute delay to get through security. I feel that the airport managment has cut costs to such an extent that the airport cannot offer the service a modern airport should give. Additionally they are penny pinching to try boost their profit margin. If only there was an viable alternative to flying through Manchester Airport (possibly the worst airport in Europe).,1.0

Then the fun starts when you enter the security area, you have to take off your jacket, belts, shoes, jewellery, then place laptop, plastic bag with liquids etc in 2 separate bins all in record time after being barked at by the staff!

574,"Although this subject has been aired at regular intervals it is apparent that the authorities at Manchester Airport, having little regard for the passengers that provide their income, remain oblivious. This is terminal 3 where, having undertaken the usual, unnecessary slalom through the tapes we encounter the first level of security. My wife’s cosmetics all in bottles of 50ml were correctly encased in a clear, re-sealable bag and in total were less than the legal capacity of one litre. We anticipated no cause for concern but sadly the bag in question was, asserted Mr Security, too big. My wife was therefore given the challenge of transferring the various items into the smaller bag he kindly provided. Since this proved impossible the excess had to be left behind at a loss of approximately £30. These could easily have transferred to her suitcase, an option not suggested by the staff, or indeed my own re-sealable bag but as I had already passed through the security gate this was naturally impossible. I was nevertheless now in the position where I could witness my backpack being pushed into the second level of security where after a wait of around 20 minutes the sole staff member triumphantly produced my medication (an inhaler and a small bottle) which although on open display in the tray should also have been encased in a bag. When I refused the offer of a bag since I already had one the surly operative told me to ‘Go and get it now.’ I refused to do so until he rephrased the request more politely in particular including the word ‘please’ at some point, a task he was able to rise to only with considerable effort. Technically the staff were correct on both counts. The transparent bag was bigger than the 20cm x 20cm they demand although (a) it caused no concern at the three other airports through which it travelled in recent weeks (b) these dimensions do not feature in EU rules (c) other airports are less rigid referring to an approximate size of 20 x 20. A 20 minute delay for failing to correctly baggage the medication which is of course not subject to the same restrictions? This is punishment, not a logical response to a security issue. Numerous others waited in line at this second level for a variety of trivial reasons. I have travelled through this terminal on numerous occasions and never once have I seen a significant intervention. How it is justified I cannot imagine. It appears to be a job creation scheme in need of urgent review and I would seriously request that the authorities initiate it without further delay.",6.0
575,"The airport is fine. They can always be better but as a facility I have no complaints worth recording, with the possible exception of some pretty long walks, still not a problem. Then we get to ""security"" and it goes wrong quickly. Not satisfied with the completely unnecessary 20-turn zigzag queue tapes that seems to be present only to wind customers up, the ""security"" staff at MAN are the most aggressive, abusive, arrogant and self-centered in the world that I have encountered in over 500 flights around the planet. They need reminding that the purpose of security is to keep passengers safe, not to provide an outlet for security staff members' control-freak tendencies. My partner was accused of carrying ""liquid"" that ultimately wasn't in that category at all (it was powder), and as a ""punishment"" they blatantly ignored and delayed her for over 20 minutes after the inspection.

This combined with continuous inconsistencies and surly staff makes Manchester probably the worst airport security experience I have come across in 40 years of flying.",1.0
577,I have been using terminal 3 for a long time at Manchester Airport and have grown to dread spending any time there. Normally on arrival we can get out quickly enough but this time there was a huge queue and we were stuck in it for at least 45 minutes. This led to us missing our train and having to buy a new one.

No bag drop for pre-checked in Finnair passengers, then told that soft sided bags can't go on conveyor! Another long queue to lift bags to waist height to go through antiquated scanner. No space for proper feed conveyor as in all other major airports in Europe. Abysmal security who insisted on unpacking virtually everything from bags and then berated me for taking up too much space with my three trays. Then insisted on re-scanning a clearly empty water bottle but overlooked two other tubes of ointment which should have been scanned. Just time to buy a bottle of water as no time to find water fountain if they have such a facility as plane boarding. Bitterly disappointed, reminded me of Heathrow 20 years ago.",2.0
580,My least favourite airport. Always get lost finding car hire returns and or petrol. No signs to either and then you find a petrol station and it's closed. You are then super late and stressed and security is an even worse experience and always an awful end to my trip. You are treated like cattle and herded through lanes of walk throughs I am sure just to delay the queue. You are yelled at and told to hurry up despite the lack of anywhere to go. Almost half the bags are funnelled off to one side. The elderly blonde lady on security seems very intent on ensuring your toiletries fit in the correct plastic bag and often need me to remove and leave an item. Whereas my boyfriend's toiletries didn't fit and were in the incorrect bag and this was ok with her. I guess Chanel body lotion and mac make-up is more of a security risk than men's hair gel. Carrying money in quantity also always seems to require the extra bag check and my bag often dissapears out of my sight for lengths of time. It always takes me about 40 mins to get through security and I have almost missed my flight several times and I always leave short of some cosmetic that got to Manchester through another airport security just fine. I purposely boycott Manchester airport for shopping so the inefficiency and rudeness of security staff at least means Manchester airport gets no more than the minimum money out of me. They should be ashamed.,1.0

As such they sell entrance to the bucket and spade travelers who drink as much as they can before they take their annual holiday. The Business traveler is excluded. This morning I was excluded, my card not acceptable at either T1 lounge. Not that they were full, quite the contrary. The staff just wanted a quiet life and to be as bloody minded as possible. It was not a case of making things happen, but of how to ensure that they didn't. My advise to the Business traveler is to avoid Manchester like the plague and where possible to use Liverpool where i have never been refused entry to their lounge",1.0
583,On returning a car to the rental village from the M56 motorway there only one sign directing you and this is after the exit ramp. If you do not know your way around the airport then this is a real problem. I can only assume the rental companies are making a little more money out of lost customers. Secondly we are at Giraffe in the food court of T1 and there was no air conditioning on the whole floor. This must be an infrastructure problem not the individual cafes so again Manchester Airport are at fault neglecting the comfort of their customers. To whom it may concern at Manchester Airport I would love to read your views on these topics.,3.0
584,"We arrived back at Manchester airport on Saturday 24th March on a Qatar Airways flight from Doha and experienced a number of issues. The first was the queue for immigration control - this was nothing short of shocking. We waited for over 30 minutes to access the passport checking facilities - we were herded like cattle and sadly the border control staff were abrupt and rude! Our flight time was over seven hours, the last thing we wanted was standing in a queue for over 30 minutes without water etc. A large number of the people in the queue were elderly and were clearly suffering! The main issue is the limited number of E Passport scanners. Given that airlines are now using aircraft capable of carrying more passengers, the airport needs to provide facilities to respond to this change. We have travelled through various airports in Asia and didn’t experience any delays like this - they provide appropriate numbers of passport checking stations (both manual and electronic) and the security and passport control staff were helpful and polite. The second issue was baggage collection. We waited for over 20 minutes to collect our suitcases! Following the time we waited at passport control, the last thing we wanted was a further protracted wait to collect our suitcases. We weren’t told why our suitcases were taking so long to arrive, clearly staffing levels for this activity are totally inadequate and this needs urgent attention by the airport. Linked to the previous issue, I have a real issue with having to pay for my baggage trolley. I appreciate its only £1 but throughout our travels this is the only airport that charged for the baggage trolley. What makes this worse, many of the travellers on our flight were not UK citizens and didn’t have a £1 coin available and hence had to move their bags manually. I’m sorry but charging for baggage trolleys is just a way of generating money for the airport! The third issue was at the arrival hall. We had to queue for nearly 5 minutes to leave as the exit was completely blocked by people waiting for travellers. The airport needs to provide adequate and controlled space for people to wait for travellers. The fourth issue is the charging for Pick Up and Drop Off parking. It states on the airport website that you can park for up to 30 mins in the Multi Storey car park for just £4.00 - taxi firms add this cost onto the fare the traveller pays. The issue is when it takes over 30 mins to complete the arrival process the cost of parking escalates - this is added burden to the traveller and is wrong! The best way to do pick-up and drop off parking is to have the first hour free and then pay for additional time. Sadly this also appears to be another way of generating money for the airport. Linked to this issue, we were told by our taxi driver that the whole collection process at Manchester Airport is a complete disaster - they experience excessive collection delays and this impacts on their scheduling processes. This is a totally unacceptable knock on effect of the delays in the arrival process. My final issue, Terminal 2 is really showing its age and looks shabby and dated in comparison to the other airports we travelled through in Asia - even small ones. It needs an urgent and radical upgrade to reflect changes in airline and traveller requirements",2.0
585,"Total chaos at security. First it wasn’t open, then an extra lane was open, queued for 30 mns, after putting trays through scanner we then had to walk back 3 scanners and queue up at another to go through body scanner, by this time our trays with valuables were stacking up, unwatched, when we walked back to retrieve our goods the lady barked at us to hurry up. I asked why the scanner that was with our tray security wasn’t open, as not our fault we could not collect trays and was told there was not enough staff. Manchester airport needs to do something about the shoddy experience for flyers, it’s bedlam and a real security risk. Anyone could have taken/stolen items from our trays as they were out of our sight due to having to go back 3 scanners for a body scan. Inside the terminal it's crowded, dingy and poor shops.

586,"It is inevitable in today’s Security climate to experience some inconvenience as part of the checking process. However I found the process more then inconvenient and very uncomfortable as you are processed through security like cattle. The whole ambience and security area is absolutely miserable (I have sympathy with the staff working in these dire conditions) you are directed downstairs into a basement area where the security process is handled and the then back up stairs into the airport, the whole area is crowded and feels confined my worst fear would be if a fire should occur. T1 is very tired building in much need of refurbishment and modernisation however that is no excuse for a lack of general cleanliness including the toilet washroom facilities, and action could be taken in the interim to improve the appearance to help make the area a more welcoming space. There is the promise of jam tomorrow but something needs to be done today to improve the whole passage experience. Our destination airport was Calgary airport and the difference was chalk and cheese. Calgary was so clean and spacious public facilities well maintained and a very welcoming space. The security process on our return through Calgary was far less stressful and this was mainly due to the ambience as the security process handling is identical. So come on Manchester get your act together. The UK airports are the first and last impressions for visitors to the UK.",4.0
587,"Used Manchester airport last week and the queues were shocking. The staff seem genuinely surprised at how many people are arriving/departing. May I suggest they take a look at the timetables and staff the security and passport control accordingly. I can just about accept queueing for security, but more desks should open when hundreds of people are queueing. Passport control on arrival into Manchester is nothing short of a joke. We waited over an hour and were herded like cattle into the pens. Non-EU passengers and passengers with identity cards were just waved through to the front without having to queue at all. Might it not be better for UK nationals to be dealt with first and after that deal with the non-EU and identity card passengers. This is the way it happens in the USA and also in Alicante airport. Spanish citizens are dealt with before any others. I will not choose another flight using Manchester airport if I can travel from another airport to the same place.

If we had really been cattle instead of substitutes the RSPCA would have closed it down. So extremely claustrophobic that I was tempted just to return without going on our much needed holiday. If there had been an emergency, security alert and a resulting panic how would we have coped? I'm sure many health and safety rules must be being breached daily in this area and I feel so sorry for regular business travellers who have no choice but to use it.

As I was early I decided to park in the arrival car park. There are no notices telling you how much the parking fee is so I was quite surprised when after 20 minutes I was charged £4.00. However I felt really bad for a driver who had parked for 2 hours and 5 minutes who had been charged £18.00 allegedly. This airport is a mess and I speak as someone who lives close by. There appears to be construction going on at all three terminals. Why don't they do it terminal by terminal. I'm not a big lover of Liverpool airport but I'll try and fly from there whenever possible until the chaos at Manchester is sorted.",1.0
594,"Just when I thought Manchester Airport couldn’t get any worse it goes and outdoes itself! Luckily I arrived 3.5 hrs early for my flight. I discovered the hall to be completely full of queues. Apparently they had shut one of the security halls due to staff shortages leaving everyone to snake around the hall. I decided to upgrade to club to ensure entrance to the priority queue only to discover that they sell priority queue entry and it was almost longer than the regular queue. So if your traveling business class folks expect to stand for hours behind a bunch of people who got free priority with their car parking. Ridiculous! So as usual this airport is the result of a business run by total amateurs. To be honest, the staff, who are usually pretty rude and unpleasant, seemed to be making the most of the total chaos and trying quite hard to make it work. In summary if you enjoy queues, get yourself over to Manchester airport, they have loads, even Starbucks managed to produce a nice long queue, starting outside of its area!",1.0
595,Manchester Airport T1 is the worst airport terminal in Europe. The check-in gates constantly move for my airline and the security process is a joke which seems to have different rules every week. The long stay car park bus runs when it feels like it and often can't be bothered doing the whole car park. The security queues are intolerable and badly managed taking an hour to get through where this only takes 10-15 mins at other european airports with the same bags and content. The queues are huge and they have to stop people getting into the queue regularly by shutting the boarding pass check gates as they can't cope with the volume of people. It cannot be hard to look at the volumes of planes and their passengers to forecast staffing and put process in place whereby people aren't hurded like cattle for an hour.,2.0
596,"I flew from Manchester T1 on Monday 12th March. I was flying with EasyJet to Copenhagen. This is the first time I have been sent to the downstairs (aka PIT) that is now the security / baggage checks if you have not paid extra for the fast pass. What can I say other than shambolic. The queue system is a joke. They randomly let people in as space comes available from anywhere in the line. The staff are obviously stressed and to be honest unfriendly. One of the conveyor belts broke causing more chaos. I fly at least once or twice a month and I have never seen anything this bad. I was expecting to be told to strip naked just to get through the scan. I am used to belts and watches sometimes being removed but cufflinks! When I flew home from Copenhagen I kept my watch, belt and cufflinks on! I realise the most important thing is security and safety and applaud any measures that improve this but why did it take me nearly 1 hour to clear this at Manchester and 10 mins in Copenhagen? The PIT is also dirty, hot and just a nasty place to be. I am a very proud Mancunian and it saddens me to see how far behind this airport is falling compared with others around the world. Finding a charging point is near impossible. The airport in general is dirty and its just not a good experience.",2.0
597,"Without a doubt the rudest security people I have ever met and I travel a lot. They treated a Spanish traveller who did not speak English as if he was a moron. He was getting late for his flight and could not explain his problem. I tried to help as I speak Spanish and now it was my turn to be treated like a moron. I then understood the Spanish guys dilemma, my bag was diverted for examination, after 30 min I still did not get my interview. Now I am running out of time, tried to draw the attention of what looked like supervisors. However, they were clearly well trained in how to ignore requests for assistance. I then started shouting and was eventually interviewed, not because of my shouting the supervisors kept ignoring me, but the police did not. Fortunately, the police did nothing and let me go about my business. My bag was examined, I was asked nothing and to this date, I do not know why my bag was diverted.",1.0
598,"Once again Security at Terminal 1 showed how not to treat people as valued customers Shouting, shoving, rude and hacked off staff, too hot, banging and bashing of trays, ages to get a simple bag rechecked.  After all that, are we any more safe? Double the staff and security lanes on at busy times, Manchester, and you would fix this. But of course that would mean less profit for your local authority shareholders, less bonuses for management and more concern to treat people as customers not cattle. And, as usual we missed the chance to enjoy the facilities. I’m now meeting people who take the hours trek to Liverpool, straight through security and no issues. You are a shambles.",1.0
599,"Truly the worst airport I have been in, after a late arrival because my first flight couldn't land I rushed to check in and go through departures with my son, the very unhelpful signage, lack of escalators and lack of customer service desks really hindered the search for my next check in desk which was hidden down one of the many bizarre areas behind other check in desks, hidden behind a wall. The airport has lots of pointless spaces that really don't make sense. With only 45 mins to get through and get to my gate, I was told I couldn't use the priority there was plenty of time, in good faith I joined the line, half the lines were in usage and the line was so slow, taking 20 mins, when I asked the lady who was directing us to each line, politely how long it normally takes to get to gates she replied not long with as much politeness as a toilet brush. This was clearly an untruth as it took myself and my son running at speed 15 mins. Lip balms delayed us yet again (my fault), when I said to inspection staff I was in a hurry they really had little regard and said I would have to speak to management. After a while they assisted, and after a slow inspection and my thanks said you might catch your flight. It seems to me that contrary to many other airports they actually enjoyed and hindered people catching their flights with little regard for peoples personal lives, we all have bad days, in the line we seemed like cattle and all the signage for rules was behind us therefore people naturally looked at the line ahead and not the rules which included no mobile phone usage, first time I have seen this rule especially as people are phoning ahead to loved ones or work to keep them in the loop about their journey. One man was very aggressive about a person using his mobile. I would really advise the staff at Manchester airport to take a little visit to Gatwick see how it is done and just to add for the shopping and eating outlets , you need people to get through to spend, I was hoping for a quick UK shop session before going home.",1.0

I totally understand the need for seriousness and security but their attitude stinks and it is in all of them, it’s either a culture of total arrogance or they are trained this way. Whatever it is it’s unnecessary, rude and makes everyone’s journey more stressful. Hate travelling through this awful airport for this reason.",1.0
601,The airport was filthy. It took one hour and twenty minutes to clear security. The security staff showed total disrespect to their customers. They were both rude and aggressive. Upon our return the escalator was broken down yet again. The hand drier in the arrivals hall was broken down yet again. The queue at Border Control was very long and slow moving and as usual the E Passport scanners created a lot of problems. The border control staff were abrupt and rude when the scanners failed to operate correctly. Altogether using Manchester Airport was a thoroughly bad experience. I am sure that most farmers treat their cattle better than Manchester Airport treats its customers.,1.0
602,"Manchester Airport, specifically Terminal 1 has got to be the worst, or one of the worst airports for a major city in Northern Europe. I'm a regular business traveler throughout Europe, and unfortunately Manchester is my ""home"" airport. The real horror is the security screening. There is clearly a total failure of management as well as the complete collapse in morale and culture among the staff who work there. The staff are rude, incompetent, and bullying. Passengers are herded around and shouted at like animals, and treated with open disdain by staff. It is nothing less than a absolute disgrace. Not only is it a really unpleasant experience, it is also bordering on being unsafe. Personally I find it amazing that the Airport supports this mess. The entire management team at Terminal 1 should be replaced.",1.0

One week a small e-reader doesn't need to be out of a bag, the next time it does. This week apparently all charger cables should have been taken out of hand luggage. And face powder (clues in the name) is a liquid. Best option is to tip your all hand luggage out into the trays probably. Terminal 3 is cramped. There is no room to manoeuvre around boots or WHSmith's. Not enough seating or places to eat.",3.0

Most of them are control freaks who obviously get their job satisfaction by bossing and bullying people around.,1.0
605,"Flying Easyjet to/from Amsterdam Feb 24/25th Feb. Outbound 1 hour to transit T1 security. Some queues feeding 8 or more channels, others only 3-5. Usual constant stream of shouting from human and mechanical sources. Situation normal. Return took 30 minutes from arrival to UK border. 10 minutes to provide stairs, then on entry to the terminal confronted by a locked door. The only way to communicate the problem was by hand signals to staff processing a departure from an adjacent gate, if this had been unmanned we would have been totally isolated. Despite said contact it took 20 minutes for a handling agent, Menzies, to open the door. By comparison, despite the late arrival / departure, the Easyjet handling agents perforrmance at Schiphol was faultless.",2.0
606,"Honestly I can’t believe Manchester has such bad reviews. I always have a pleasant time at Manchester. It’s got short queues, friendly staff, adequate bars/restaurants (thought depending on the terminal can get too busy). On this occasion I was in terminal 3 which is probably my least favourite - mostly because of the lack of a central area with bars and restaurants - the little area it does have is always overcrowded and you’re lucky to get a seat. It’s clean(ish), staff are helpful, well signed and generally security queues are reasonable and efficient. If you think it’s bad, try going to CDG - it’ll give you a new perspective!",7.0
607,"Worst security scanning system in the world. I use Manchester nearly every week as a very frequent business traveler. This parallel loading of trays is invariably a total lottery, particularly at peak times such as before 10am. Passengers need several trays, these trays get split up as there can be up to 4 people loading the conveyor. This result is people waiting at the end, thereby causing trays to back up. I know identical systems are used in Stansted, Heathrow etc but it does not work as well as the normal 'in series' system used by every other airport across the world. Look at airports such as Geneva or Hamburg for best in class. The Manchester system also adds additional stress and anxiety to infrequent flyers, and it's no wonder staff are correspondingly stressed, and sometimes terse to passengers. No doubt some very expensive time-in-motion consultants propsed it, maybe they and the airport management should use it to experience the pain.",3.0

One of four travelators working. A long way. Got there - no hot food (8pm). Went back to The Station - two out of six travelators working. Arrived back from Philly last Tuesday 13th and guess what? Four out of six travelators not working? Heavy bags, exhausting struggle back to The Station. No help offered or apparently available. Went thru PHL, CMH, ODR airports and guess what? All travelators working everywhere. Must do better - very disappointing and will be reluctant to use MAN again.",3.0

Surely the company that runs this place must look at other international airport hubs and are embarrassed.

610,"My departure was marred by incredibly rude security staff, in hindsight it was obvious I was singled out (perhaps because I had no check-in luggage for a long-haul flight?) as twice I got to the front of a queue and was then told to join another line. On reaching the front the third time I was pushed into the full body scanner, then taken out and frisked, followed by a going over with yet another machine. I felt violated and couldn't understand why a 70 year old retired UK professional engineer should be subject to this sort of treatment and given no explanation when a complaint was made at the time. It doesn't end there. On my return my wife came to collect me at Terminal 2 Arrivals and was met by a temporary barrier and a rude jobsworth (where do they find these morons?) and told she had to go in the multi-storey where it cost her £4 for a 6 minute stay.

Eventually found the right check-in and the automated barriers wouldn't work, took me 3 minutes before a member of staff helped me get through the barriers. The queues at security checks are fairly short (though we were travelling at 9am). There were very little seats and the airport was so crowded that there wasn’t any spare seats, so I had to stand for 1 hour. The only good thing of the airport is that there is a wide variety of duty-free stores at the airport. Will try to avoid them at all costs in the future.",2.0

The whole place reeks of neglect and under-investment, and it is frankly embarrassing when business customers have to use it.

They look at you like an alien and then tell you what to do rather than giving good advice in a pleasant and happy manner.

I understand security is vital but MAN T1 can learn so much more from other airports. Geneva for example has 13 scanners side by side staffed with happy smiley people.

621,"My husband was told in security that his insulin has to be emptied from the original company packinging. All medication packaging was removed and we were told that all insulin pens should be carried in clear bags.

Upon request they returned the boxes to us or otherwise the destation of the boxes were to be the bin. We were also told that he cannot carry the amount of insulin he has but the fact is he’s on a very high dose and the diabetes center has advised to carry all insulin on hand to avoid any inconvenience if luggage is lost. Also insulin pens need to be refrigerated which can be handed over to the airline crew for refrigeration. Due to all this happening my husband is now scared and stressed out to travel from Manchester Airport. He’s worrying that they don’t make an issue of his insulin and reject him from taking it.

Terminal 1 should be demolished forthwith as its not fit for purpose. Security is important and vital but profiling passengers is a better way and has better outcomes.

624,"I use Manchester airport once or twice a year and have done for over 20 years, firstly the airport is not as bad as some claim, it's a busy airport so there will be queues for both check in / bag drop and yes the dreaded security, but unless you own your own airport you will have to share this one with other people. Some people really do think they are the only person there. Last time I used T2 bag drop took 20 minutes, I had purchased a fast track pass and security took 10 minutes to clear even though I accidentally left fluids in my hand luggage and was treated to extra checks, I have always found the security staff relatively friendly and generally treat you as you treat them. Inside T2 isn't great but it's a transit area where you spend a couple of hours waiting, both the spinning jenny and cabin bar are awful, but there are other places to sit and get a drink, the escape lounge has improved vastly over the last couple of years and at 25 quid is a bargain. I arrived at my gate when the screen displayed boarding and encountered a very rude man (MIA staff) who asked why i was late, I pointed out that it was 40 minutes prior to departure and he continued to be rude, once at the plane door I asked the TUI cabin crew if I was late and she politely said I wasn't late, so no need to be rude. Overall a decent airport with queues certainly a lot less than JFK where it took 3 hours to clear. My tips for T2 and TUI would be to use the day before bag drop of you can, arrive early if you can't, buy a fast track pass for a fiver, and if you can book the escape lounge all this goes a long way to making the experience less stressful, oh, and finally treat MIA staff as you would like to be treated, they will generally do the same.",8.0

Obviously passengers are not the priority at this airport it’s shops. Outdated and looking like a load of porta cabins string together.

Almost every passengers baggage was diverted to secondary screening, resulting in no one being able to move forward, causing further backlog.

The queues for the bag searching were so long all of the scanners were held up and queues were not moving at all yet there were still 4 staff members per metal detector just standing around talking to each other. Perhaps you need more staff on the bag searching if that is the hold up. My hold up was becauset the solid mineral deodorants (not a paste/gel/liquid) must go in the liquid bags. Upon questioning why my lush face wash (a rough paste) did not have to go in the bag if this solid stick does I was informed ""it just doesn't"".

631,"Initially getting off the plane it's not the tidiest looking airport, but that's not the problem. I often fly through Birmingham and have been to Manchester airport less than a handful of times. I had a 3 hour wait between flights so I wanted to make my way to transfers and up to the departure lounge. Straight off the plane opposite me were signs, one directed me to the right for arrivals and one to the left for flight transfers. I headed left and entered through some doors signed flight transfers and didn't question why it didn't seem very busy as it wasn't a bustling terminal I entered from. I also didn't question it as a previous transfer flight I was on only had two transfer passengers on board, myself included, so I didn't expect a busy environment. There were two men at a desk, one who spoke to me and talked down to me like I was an idiot because I went into the wrong transfer office, it was the only one sign posted from the terminal I entered after my flight. After saying this still no staff member told me where to go, not even this man. I was still not being told anything helpful, only being told what he can't do for me. I am a young girl travelling alone and have flown many times, I wouldn't consider myself a novice flyer or an idiot. Luckily a young man came over and politely directed me to the transfer desk for my flight which eased my anxiety slightly. I am a frequent flyer and used the information I was given (the signs) and followed all instructions I was given correctly. I went through the transfers on the other side to the terminal, in departures I found a seat in Costa (at its last free table) for the duration of my wait but there is not much seating in the departure lounge generally unless you want to pay for drinks/food and sit in somewhere, it seems very overcrowded and no staff member seemed willingly helpful to anyone. More passengers were helping passengers and directing each other because we are more reliable than the employees. I have been very put off by the staff. This airport needs to tidy themselves up, maybe partake in some kind of hospitality training, they are in the service industry after all and they need to update their facilities and signs. This is not an anomaly as my last stop here also wasn't a pleasant experience due to overcrowding and rude staff in the lounge, I recommend (if you can, as I know sometimes the cheapest offer does not give you a choice) flying somewhere else if you want to be treated respectfully by polite staff and have somewhere to relax and sit comfortably.

Example - Priority boarding ticket was rejected by one member only to be accepted by another when I complained. Long security queues. The longest I have experienced in any international airport. Security scanning rules that seem to change daily and depending on which member of staff is doing them. Not enough seating in the terminals or gates.

It appears as if the airport wants to squeeze every penny from the travellers and cause them a lot of inconvenience. There are hardly any staff near the luggage carousels to help the travellers.

Security bag scans stopped my girlfriend for having lipstick and mascara in her hand luggage and made a big noise about it. Seems to be a lot of duplication of checkpoints, I think we had to have our tickets manually checked at 4 different points. On top of that the whole place looks like it needs a refurb. Drivng there for drop off is easy and well sign posted compared to BHX and some other airports, and I had a nice coffee from Costa but that was about it.",3.0

If the amount of customers is too big to stay polite, why not re-consider the politics of easy transfer? We had to check out and back in, even with only cabin luggage, because we had two airlines combined. The rude explanation was, that one of them is not paying their fees for this transfer - why give them a choice? It would make customers a little more happy to be able to use the fast tracks, especially as there are so many delays, that you hardly ever have time enough.

639,Security at Terminal 1 was horrendous! Never seen it so bad. It was in an overheated basement. The staff were very rude and people were treated like cattle. I understand security is very important but given the amount of money this airport makes there has to be a more efficient way of doing things. The airport is dirty and old fashioned. On arrival waiting for baggage took more than 40 minutes. The saving grace was the man in Boots who was so polite and friendly.,2.0
640,We are living on the Isle of Man and traveled to Hamburg Germany over the Christmas days. Unfortunately we choose Manchester Airport for transit. This was one of our worst experiences at an airport ever. The security people are the most impolite and rude persons that we ever met in our lives. One of the strangest things is that you can use the transit way from one terminal to an other only if you have booked your flights with a company that suits the airport. I think this behavior is unique. We have been shouted not to go there with our tickets of a budget airline. I hope that we never have to use this airport again.,1.0
641,"I just want to reiterate the comments of others about the chaotic security. I travel a lot. Manchester has the most inefficient bureaucratic security I have ever come across. Bags are rejected for trivial reasons, about 50% of bags are rejected to be searched, which causes an immense line to build up. Most of the time it is for a trivial reason, in this case my wife’s medication was not in a bag. Basically these guys need to see how security theatre is done elsewhere in the world and take some notes, because all they doing is driving traffic to other airports and will eventually do themselves out of jobs.",3.0

After huge queue to check in when turning up in excess of two hours in advance, we go through security, only for the bag to be sidelined for more checking. Half hour wait later and very stressed the bag gets towards the front of the line and a supervisor puts it back in the scanner and sends it to the back of the line. When I question him, he says he didn't do that despite me watching him. The attitude stinks. He says I've left liquid in it.

No order whatsover, luggage was picked randomly for security check, this was even worse than the security check in Israel.

647,Diabolical experience going through security today. Absolute chaos and very rude men shouting their heads off about removing items from the case. It felt like I was entering into a prison with the behaviour of the security staff. No one helpful and smiley just screaming at you and many cases were taken off for extra individual searches. So we had a line of around 30 bags at a time which took at least 30 minutes to be processed. Luckily I was not short of time but some people were panicking about missing flights due to the inefficient bag checks. No time to buy any food/drinks or shopping as stood waiting for case so further loss of revenue for the airport! I have never experienced this in any other airport and it was most unpleasant - I realise they have an important job to do but surely their attitude could be improved. Or maybe employ more staff?

Many people anxious about missing their flight, being a mental health professional I find this not acceptable.

There were quite a few other passengers waiting from other destinations. I was thoroughly disgusted with this service.

Arriving from overseas into Terminal 3 is a love hate affair. I have stood there for 45 minutes waiting in line to use the electronic passports checking system. There needs to be at least triple the amount of these machines, better still get rid of them and employ more Passpory Control Staff to check passports or better still bring back the IRIS System, brilliant system never understood why it was taken out of service.

657,"Simply awful and in some places disgusting and scary. And very, very, very tiresome. In the 'olden days' - i.e. the 1980's, 1990's, and 2000's, the old Manchester 'Ringway' airport was well known and loved by all who lived in the North West of the UK and used it regularly for holidays abroad. The Terminal 2 extension was welcome and it was a modern, comfortable, and functional addition to the existing airport. I cant put my finger on exactly when things started to change, but certainly over the last five years, at least, I have noticed a rapid and continual decline in almost every aspect of the airport experience. Without writing War and Peace I will set out the key problems with this airport [with reference to Terminal 1 upon departure]: 1) The road network access has become increasingly complicated to the point where it is almost inaccessible with any kind of ease. It seems that the airport doesn't like taxis, because the taxi drop-off facilities are so poor. I think the airport likes private cars and really just wants to provide car parking for these, which I presume it makes a lot of money from. 2) Baggage check-in is relatively uncomplicated unless you have a holdall-type bag, pushchair, or similar. The arrangements for getting these handed over for loading onto the plane are complicated, time-consuming, ill-signposted - you get the idea. Manchester Airport doesn't seem to like bags they think are difficult to process, and seems to feel entitled to make life difficult for the users of the airport in return. 3) Security screening is, quite simply, horrendous. Bedlam. Strip search territory. Airport staff with blank staring eyes barking orders at people. Children and old people looking bewildered and frightened by it all. Electronic body scanners. Scowling airport staff if people don't comply with their frenetic screeched commands instantly. If nothing else spoils your holiday [apart from arrival at the airport upon return - see later] then this will. 4) After you clear security screening Manchester Airport sends you through the yellow brick road of their ""duty free"" shops. There is no escape from this tour of things you don't want to buy because to get to the main lounge you have to go through the shops. You just have to keep plodding on like lemmings. 5) When you clear the yellow brick road of consumerism the first thing you see is the obligatory car gambling podium. There has been a 'luxury' car lottery-type thing going on at Manchester Airport for many years now. It is very, very, very tedious. 6) The main departure lounge at the airport is nothing to write home about. Over the years they have gradually reduced the seating to practically nothing, with the exception of seating in food outlets. Thus you are compelled to spend money consuming over-priced food/drink. 7) The toilets in the main departure lounge are grossly inadequate for the size of the facility. There are not enough toilets. The toilets are generally dirty, wet, and smelly. Just disgusting. Upon arrival back at the airport after a holiday, things do not get any better. Passport Control is a ridiculous affair. Endless zig-zag lines of people queueing. Airport or Customs staff barking orders and shouting at people. Scowling immigration officers. Ridiculous electronic passport machines that work badly. Luggage carousel delays. And of course, yet more filthy, dirty, and disgusting toilets. I am going to try Liverpool Airport.",3.0
658,"What an absolute dump and a disgrace for the city of Manchester. Had the chance to use both Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 recently, and these places are like something from the 1960's. Squashed, dark little passages everywhere, it feels like a local authority building built in 1960, and has less charm than a garden shed. In case you wonder what basis I comment, I visit on average about 50 airports worldwide each year, and this is worse than many in Africa. Terminal 1 arrivals is a mess, cramped and dirty - departures is even worse, overcrowded with rather cheap shopping area. Dirty is a polite description for the two sets of toilets I used. Security at 0730 in T1 was awful, and they need some serious advice from airports even like Heathrow that are so much better. I feel sorry for the people of Manchester and nearby to be stuck with such an awful, awful airport, and the company managing this place should be fired.",1.0
659,"I have traveled extensively and have a list of the worst airports I have encountered, Manchester Airport managed to raise itself to the very top of that list. Departure: Arrive a good 6 hours ahead of flight (arriving in Manchester by train). Signage is very poor from the train to the terminal building, but - managed. Found the terminal - found the Emirates counter, had a long wait 3 hours before flight - counter opened, and was processed fairly quickly. Had a cloth based bag - was told it had to go in ""special handling"" 15 minute wait for special handling - bag was thrown onto conveyor. 45 minute wait to enter security, 38 minute wait to place items on security conveyor belt. 22 minutes wait for items to come out of the security conveyor belt. Warnings of additional 40+ minute wait if your bag is pulled for screening. Contact yelling and abuse by staff to empty all toiletries etc. Express passes for idiots: If you do not plan ahead tell security and get brought straight to the front of the line and really annoy the people who were smart, arrived early, and waited patiently. Was physically moved from the conveyor belt, my items removed, to allow a couple who ""arrived late because of traffic"". No warning, no please or thank you - I mumbled complaint and was told ""you better remain quiet"". So; for those doing the math - I arrive 6 hours early for my flight, and I am now left with 1 hour before the flight leaves - and the departure board is still not showing a gate. Decided to have a beer. Stood patiently waiting for bar tender to finish taking the order in front of me, when they paid and left, so did the bar tender. All 7 remaining bar staff were helping clients further along the counter and refused to acknowledge me. I left. Saw two Emirates crew members walking to the gate. Followed them, tried to enter the seating area, and was rudely told to take a seat as they were not ready to begin processing people. Sat patiently, was finally allowed to enter the seating area. Waited patiently, was finally (5 minutes to departure time) allowed to enter the gangway. Assisted another passenger carry her bags as she was left holding baby and all bags - and no staff offered to help. Flight crew finally came to the gangway and saw us all patiently waiting behind the ribbon and allowed us to enter. Overall - the worst airport I have ever traveled through. Never again. All staff were rude, airport is dirty and old feeling, passenger flow management is terrible, signage is awful - and - its all the passengers fault (according to all staff I met).",1.0
660,"Reminiscent of a 1950s bus station but without the charm. Arrival and departure from Manchester Airport was a truly grim experience, and for an arriving passenger (especially a Brit coming back from abroad) a shock. Firstly in international arrivals a toilet cubicle not just with no toilet paper but with no receptacle for toilet paper (seemed to have been torn off the wall and disappeared) and no soap in the basin cleaner. Then an information counter whose staff, when asked for my connecting airline just said ""never heard of it"" (after I insisted, her younger colleague then bothered to look it up and direct us to it). Incredibly long walk between terminals - the information said ""you could take a taxi"". The domestic terminal had a mass scene of huge numbers of Ryanair passengers having their bags measured but we got through this to our own airline. Because of a delayed flight (not the airport's fault, of course) we were referred to an interline booking counter where over an hours wait involved standing the whole time as there was no seating anywhere. Indeed apart from the cafes the departures terminal seemed just to have no seats. This wait included their attempt to contact the airport hotel and getting no reply, and a lengthy negotiation to get us a £10 meal voucher, although meal options were surprisingly limited. The crowds milling round the terminal generally seemed grumpy and we were not surprised. To think that Manchester once bid to host the Olympics! Pathetic. It is a wonderful city and a wonderful community and deserves a lot better than this. Finally when we left Manchester on our domestic UK flight we had more intrusive and aggressive security than we have ever experienced. Nobody should mind airport security these days but rude men insisting on every item of a handbag being removed in public and individually inspected with aggressive remarks - underwear, cosmetics, everything - is something different.",1.0
661,"Arrived Manchester Airport to find three trolley signs showing 'Out of Order'. Fourth one had a few trolleys but not working. Spoke to airport staff to say it was a very bad image for passengers arriving at airport. He indicated which two trolley sites were in operation so finally got a trolley. Also I don't understand why passengers are expected to pay for a trolley? It's not the type of equipment that people want to keep or run away with and it's an extra task after long flight and perhaps no sterling currency. (I do wonder whether the change machines might also have been out of order?) Next problem was, as it appears to be quite common from previous flights, some of the walkway conveyor belts weren't operating. Rather embarrassing. We need to project a welcome and efficiency at the gateway to our country.",3.0
662,"Manchester Airport is without doubt the single worst airport I have travelled through in recent years. It's hard for me to put into words how much I hate this airport. I travel once a month minimum for work and this is my local airport. I am always struck by how every airport I encounter on the return journey - whether it be USA, China or elsewhere in Europe - shows Manchester up to be terrible. Security here is the crux of it. The staff are rude to the point of aggressiveness. Staff turnover is extremely high, hence the constant recruitment drives you see adverts for when you pass through, and I think that is reflected in the service delivered. Manchester is also the only airport I have ever passed through ever that counts such things as a push-on deodorant stick as liquid ""because it is spreadable at room temperature"" - literally anything is spreadable at room temperature, it is merely a question of how much pressure is applied. Bags are pulled for re-scanning for the most spurious of reasons. You will never see more bags pulled at any other airport. I suspect they are working to quota. Literally no other airport anywhere ever, have I seen the kind of chaos nonsense I see at Manchester on a regular basis. Today was my 15th or 16th trip through there this year. Today was another level again. First a guy who seemed to be in the middle of a panic attack, as if he was organizing the evacuation of Dunkirk, demanding in urgent panicked fashion that every little thing be put in a separate tray, so that usually what takes me three trays - I carry the same things for business all the time - today took six. Then on the other side, his counterpart, a guy who seemed to be working his first day on the front line and was as pumped up and gung-ho as a guy doing his first day in the vietnam jungle. Move! Move! Don't stand there! Keep moving, he's shouting at people, which again, I have never seen at this airport or any other. He's also yanking trays the second anyone takes their stuff out of them. I said to him, calm down, is this your first day or what? He got verbally aggressive in response; at the same time, he's still pulling trays left right and center and feeding them back into the machine, so his mate at the front can have a steady supply of empty trays for his ""every pencil needs a separate tray!"" regime. I got hassled out of there and then went to board and only when I got on the plane did I realize that he had stacked an empty tray onto a tray of mine which contained a kindle and a portable hard drive. Manchester Airport direct you to a third-party lost-luggage company if you leave anything in their airport security, or elsewhere. So I had to spend an hour on hold to speak to a woman based somewhere in the south of England who told me that there was no record of anything being left at T3, matching my description. If you at all have the chance to travel from Liverpool or any other airport other than Manchester, take it. The security procedure is a joke and for sure they will ruin your day / trip.",2.0

664,"Usually a traveller through Manchester Airports Groups sister airport of East Midlands but due to the time of year the destination we were traveling to was only available through Manchester. Surely a major airport though would be a wonderful experience in comparison, with on the ball security, pleasant well trained staff, a wide choice of restaurants, organised boarding and on our return, well ordered border control. Oh how wrong can you be! Manchester airport from start to finish is a disgrace. Upon arrival at the T1 long stay car park all appeared ok although the parking space was a little tight. We got the transfer bus easily enough but we made our first encounter with the driver whom obviously didn't want to be there, grumpy and barking orders re our luggage. On arrival at T1 I was shocked at how dated the facade was but hoped it would improve inside. It didn't. The entrance was confusing with poor signage and there appeared to be a number of homeless rough sleepers in the area. Eventually we stumbled on security (we were taking hand luggage only) and we had had the foresight to pay for fast track so walked to the front of the queue. Like others have said the staff there seamed sullen and enjoyed barking out their orders. Handily I have worked in security at EMA so knew the drill and placed all by belongings in several trays and proceeded through the scanner and onto retrieve the same. Two trays had however been pulled for inspection. The two members of staff that dealt with me were both rude, sullen and divoid of any customer care. My crime was that I hade left asthma inhalers in my jacket pocket and a couple in my case. How is it that two different MAG airports have different rules re inhalers. EMA do not consider inhalers as a 'liquid' yet seamingly Manchester do. The staff member proceeded to put them in a plastic bag, not sealed it as they should and do a sniff test on them! Anyway once these were deemed safe to travel we made it through to the departure lounge, what a dump! Forced through the duty free area we eventually found such a poor selection of restaurants we could barely find anything worthy of eating. When we did it was the typical over inflated prices for poor quality. We had got there early which was just as well as despite it being off season the terminal fillled quickly with obviously insufficient seating so many just stood around. When our gate was called it was a bit of a hike made worse by having to try and push through groups of people whom were waiting at their gates with no obvious organisation. The whole experience leaving via Manchester left such a poor impression but finally we were on our way, albeit somewhat stressed. Unfortunately our return did nothing to improve our view of the place. On leaving the aircraft we were ushered through a tight warren of back stairs and cramped corridors. For anyone with mobility issues this would have been a nightmare. We eventually got to border control - oh dear! The queues were large and despite being a couple were directed into the family lane. This queue did not move. It was manned by three officers manually checking passports when there were several unmanned booths. It took from leaving the place to stepping out of the airport over 70 minutes. When we did we met the same cheerless bus driver after a furthe 15 minutes. It's not too strong to say I hate this airport. Poorly staffed by unhappy people, a company only driven by profit and not the customer experience.",1.0

It cost £150 and not only had our car been damaged but despite it being cleaned the day of arrival, the condition of the car was shocking. You would think it had been in a Car rally thick of dust. No attendants on hand to ask about the damage, one did spot us but he vanished quickly when realising we were actually looking for someone to give advice. We have used the multi storey parking at Manchester for years and can honestly say this is the worst experience ever.

Restaurant prices were stupid and bathrooms were small and few and far between. Curiously, every single staff person we dealt with was courteous and helpful.

668,"The UK's ""3rd World"" Airport! MAN is dull, dated and dreary. Disembarked from EasyJet flight from MUN on 29 Sept in T1 to find a long slow moving queue for immigration. No signs to indicate that this was for EU or non-EU passports until entering the immigration hall so my wife and I spent as long getting to the immigration hall as we spent getting processed as non-EU arrivals. From disembarkation to leaving airport in pre-booked hire car took 1hr 45mins with well over 1hr spent in immigration - by comparison the trips through customs and immigration at Singapore and Brisbane too 30mins! Check in for departure on Etihad EY16 on 10 Oct at T1 was slow due to many passengers having excess baggage and the need to check 90% of cabin baggage to see that it ""complied"". Security check a shambles - why does my passport and boarding pass have to be X-rayed? After clearing security and the ""slow crawl"" through duty free you get to a food area more reminiscent of a shopping centre food court. For those of you returning a hire car to MAN be warned that there are no longer any petrol stations at MAN so you need to ""fill up"" before getting to the airport. Car hire ""village"" is actually well signposted and the shuttle buses operate frequently. Would I recommend MAN?

669,"As someone who much prefers Liverpool Airport as a departure point, I was not looking forward to flying from Manchester, especially after reading the many critical reviews here. In fact, everything turned out to be much better than expected. Arriving just after 04.00, my wife and I found Terminal 3 not to be too busy and, with hand luggage only, we went straight to security. Inevitably the security area was more congested and less easy to negotiate than its counterpart at Liverpool, but the staff we encountered were both friendly and helpful. We were through in less than half an hour. We circumvented both the duty free and bar areas and easily found seats in our gate area. The loos nearby were in perfectly reasonable condition. The only negative feature on our outward transit was the queues in both WHSmith and Boots, so we managed without a newspaper or bottle of water. Returning a week later was also relatively painless. There were queues at passport control, but all the e-passport gates were working and the two officials manning the queues were not unsympathetic to anyone experiencing difficulties. (The e-passport gates still seem slower than showing your passport to a real person, though). Having no hold luggage to collect, we were out of the terminal about half an hour after landing. It did then take us at least another 30 minutes on the transfer bus back to Jet Park 3, partly because of the road / building works going on around the airport. We were finally en route home at least an hour after touchdown and for us this is the big drawback of Manchester compared with Liverpool: we would have been nearly home by then had we arrived in Liverpool, even though we live equidistant from either airport. So, despite our experience of Manchester being surprisingly good on this occasion, we will still opt for Liverpool in the future whenever possible.",7.0

However because of the size of the seating area there is never anywhere to sit, that's if your willing to sit among the hen and stag parties drinking and partying at 5am, and the organisation is terrible. There is a small very overpriced breakfast counter behind this, if you can push through the overflow from the seating area. Worst terminal I think I've ever used. It needs more options and organisation for the amount of passengers passing through.",1.0
672,"This airport always manages to ruin the first day of my holiday. I absolutely dread heading for security. The way the staff there treat passengers is diabolical. Everyone knows they have an important job to do but why do they have to be so rude, nasty and aggressive to people? The queues are horrendous with staff barking orders. Then when you finally get to the point where your trays are checked they speak to you like naughty children. God forbid if you forget to remove your belt or watch. it's a wonder they don't put you in front of a firing squad. I'm a little hard of hearing so don't always catch what they say in such a mad chaotic environment which means I'm often singled out for a bit of extra humiliation because I don't always obey their commands immediately. This time I was made to take out my hearing aids, undo my jeans button for the inside of the waistband to be checked, then body frisked. Unfortunately I had a screwed up tissue in my back pocket, so was even made to turn out all my pockets. Don't think I've ever felt guilty about the need to wipe my nose before. By this time my tray of belongings had gone through the scanners ages before, where it was left at the end of the rollers. Anyone could have walked away with my bag, passport etc. Not very security conscious then are they? Do they take great delight in acting this way knowing if you complain you'll be subjected to more torture. We flew back from Faro where it was just as busy because of the Monarch fiasco but there it was so different. (They actually smiled.) Then there's Manchester passport control to face when arriving home. Yet another nightmare with surly rude staff and long queues. Thank goodness we had to return to Gatwick this time because we'd booked with Monarch. I can't write much about the rest of Manchester airport as I get too wound up to notice but we will be flying from Leeds/Bradford from now on if possible.",2.0
673,"We flew Air Canada rouge from Terminal 2 in Premium rouge. We parked in T2 Meet & Greet which we had no problem with at all. We got into the terminal to find that our airline was checking in on the bottom floor instead of with the other carriers. Given we were in Premium we got to go to the premier check-in line, which was quite convenient as the main check-in line was extremely long and the speed of the main check-in was slow as passengers travelling onwards to Orlando were being asked if they would like to volunteer to instead travel direct on VS. The premier service continued when we reached security and we were permitted to use the Priority Lane. The standard queue had an extremely long length. The departures lounge has a good range of shops and restaurants, but the wifi in the terminal is quite bad therefore we used our own mobile data. The terminal was unclean and there weren't plenty seats at the boarding gate. The washrooms were disgusting and I chose against using them. By the time our flight was called, although priority passengers were the only ones allowed to board first, everyone crowded around the boarding door, which I have noticed to form a trend in my recent travel experiences through Manchester, and on flights to Manchester. It was hard to get through to the gate. Would prefer to avoid Manchester, but would fly from if unable to fly elsewhere.",5.0
674,"Rude, just rude. Imagine your first trip abroad, you get to the airport security, you've heard it's strict but you are certainly prepared. No belt, liquid in a suitable bag, baggage allowance spot on, boots off. This requires little amount of time and is absolutely not an Olympic sport - it's definitely not necessary to have someone standing barking at you from the side line. ""No way, you must be joking, absolutely not, this is a joke"" - as you place your hairdryer on the same tray as your boots. ""No, no, no, no, no, no, no"" - as the see-through plastic bag, was not the prescribed, ""Hand me the appropriate see-through bag"" he yells to the other side of the room, causing all kinds of commotion - increasing my level of airport anxiety almost to the point of meltdown. After 9 individual trays, with one of my possessions in each. I think finally, it's over. I'll walk through safe and sound, find myself sipping a nice cold one after all the drama. I start to walk toward the body scanner. ""Erm, where do you think you're going"", I turn around, only to be faced by the same staff member ""Are you joking? Hat off now"", his final bark before he moves onto his next victim. Now a jibbering wreck, I step foot in the scanner - auditory sensation depleated due to the stress that the barker had put me through. I fail to hear the instructions of the operater to pass through the scanner and stand for an embarrassing 5 seconds longer with my arms in the air, traumatised to say the least. I leave the body scanner, and stand watching all of my 9 trays causing quite the congestion on the conveyer. Still shaken, I stand there trying to work out a gathering strategy - overwhelmed by this task I had to summon the assistance of my travelling companion, who obviously had breezed through the experience and waited impatiently for to come out the other side. So thank you, for ruining what should have been a great start to my holiday and beware, don't let this staff member upset you. Be prepared to spend an extorianate amount on booze at the airport bar to calm your fraid nerves and have one for me and this memory.",1.0
675,"Manchester to Jamaica and back. As other's have said on here the airport is more than ready for a redevelopment and the sooner the better. Arriving at the airport check in with Thomson was very easy but arriving upstairs to the security line was horrific, the staff were so rude and pushy, the line wasn't that long but it was very hot in there. I was pulled aside for a check by security, the man was very rough in the way he did this and his attitude was very poor. Arriving airside and I must say its gone downhill a lot, a number of gates are now not being used due to the redevelopment, this area of the terminal they have simply forgotten about as the lights were turned off with rubbish everywhere. The toilets are a total disgrace as mentioned many times on here, the gents toilets were terrible, locks missing off the doors, urinals over flowing, no toilet paper in the cubicles' and no cleaning staff to be seen. Gate 300 - we looked on the departure board and to our horror we had to use gate 300, I hate this gate with a passion, why you ask? Well being crammed into a small gate area with 300 + people isn't bad enough there was also a Singapore Airlines flight leaving at the same time meaning another 300 + people. It was hot and cramped and badly organised. The staff boarded premium passengers and elderly passengers first, they then said we will board by rows! Utter lies they shouted for everybody to come forward, 250+ people are pushing is a total joke. We then boarded a bus to the remote stand, they kept pushing more and more people on to the bus until they couldn't shut the doors, it was a very hot day already and then having to wait on the tarmac to board the aircraft people were starting to feel ill. Arriving back into Manchester at least this time we had a jet bridge to make things easier, security was very slow and there was only our flight, seems like the passport gates had more broken than working, baggage was extremely slow arriving we stood about nearly 30 mins waiting for it. They then decided to only allow use of 1 exit door while a dog sniffed you resulting in a long delay leaving the airport.",5.0

Manchester might have the delusion of an international airport but falls very short. As a Mancunian very sorry to post this,1.0
677,"Four of us had breakfast at The Cabin on 25th September. Filthy tables, overpriced and disgusting food. In addition, people were consuming large amounts of alcohol (it was 5am). On return, (Sept 29th) we visited the toilets before our journey home. There was a lock missing off the door in one of the ladies toilets, but my husband was horrified by the sight which greeted him in the gents. Two urinals were overflowing and four out of six soap dispensers had no soap. Not only is this not good enough, it is also a health hazard. Will think very carefully before using Manchester again.",3.0
678,"Parked car at off airport site and caught shuttle to T2. Unfortunately all roads around the airport were gridlocked, possibly due to road works being carried out in several different sites. Eventually got to check in for Qatar which was quick and efficient and got a fast track pass for security. The room where the security checks are carried out is like a cave, dimly lit, poorly ventilated and an absolute disgrace. It was completely chaotic with the staff seemingly unable to decide between themselves what was and was not allowed to be carried on board. Even with fast track it took 20 minutes to get through the security checks. The toilets in the terminal were disgraceful, they were smelly and looked as if they had not been cleaned in ages. This also applied to the toilets in the premier lounge area. On return to Manchester on a Sunday lunchtime, we were met with long queues for passport control and it seemed that half the automatic passport machine readers were not working correctly. Eventually we got through and went to baggage collection. AS always at Manchester, priority baggage tags mean nothing and despite being clearly labelled as PRIORITY, our bags came off the carousel way down the list. Please could the directors of Manchester airport get their act together and make improvements to the airport and its systems? It is a disgrace and I dread using this airport.",2.0
679,Lack of common sense and common courtesy astounding! The airport is dirty and staff untrained as far as I can tell. The queue for security was fair and manned by dozens of unsmiling staff but the rollers were completely blocked at the other end by empty trays. Not one of them had the sense to move. This as you can imagine caused a considerable pile up of people who's trays were still on the other side. Toilets stink and were littered with overflowing mop buckets. Hand dryer placed in the doorway to the ladies so anyone drying their hands blocked the entrance and exit. Just an awful experience.,1.0
680,"Shameful customer experience. Travelling right now through Manchester Airport, once again the security experience is disgraceful. Terminal 1 passengers without priority boarding are denied entry to normal security, this is now for paying fast track passengers only and shuffled off down to the basement where only 2 of 4 lanes are open and you have to join a long line. Staff don't like it when you complain and single you out for extra security checks. Nil points for customer service. Overall Manchester Airport is a shadow of its former self, shabby, cramped and crowded. Avoid if you can book via other airports where the owners care about people. Shame on Manchester combined authorities for allowing this at an airport that we the North West taxpayers own.",2.0

I was instructed to walk up the ramp by a lady in uniform (yellow tabard). On finding a wheelchair at the top of the ramp I was asked to wait while someone to push was found. A member of my party took over at that point as no-one seemed available. I was pushed to the Meet and Greet reception to pick up my car. This involved crossing what appeared to be a newly laid ramp over a road behind the car park. This ramp was made of cobble stones - highly unsuitable for wheelchairs. Also, when passing through Customs, my passport was removed from its case and not put back - this did not happen on any other occasion on my trip. The Customs Officer seemed more intent on having a humorous conversation with a colleague.",1.0
684,"On arrival at the airport the departure procedure appeared chaotic with little in the way of organisation resulting in queues everywhere and harassed staff clearly not in control. Mother in law aged 69 activated scanner due to a metal implant in her hip but was subject to a body search and had to remove her shoes in full view of other passengers. Not a dignified arrival for her despite clearly having mobility issues and walking with a stick. Staff appeared uncaring and unsympathetic showing no respect for her and failing to maintain her dignity. On returning from holiday our arrival was little better than our departure a week earlier. Returning passengers becoming bottle-nosed in queues which led to backlogging of escalators and people unable to move due to stationary lines of travellers. A degree of panic ensued due to people being unable to alight the escalator. Very much a health and safety issue this is an accident waiting to happen. Very long meandering queue at passport control luckily we were ushered quickly through a separate channel due to mother in laws poor mobility. In conclusion, poor organisation, poor management and an inability to cope safely with the traffic of people using this facility. Unless you want your holiday experience tainted then I seriously suggest flying from elsewhere.

The whole set up needs a shake up, staff and facilities alike. Any good news? Yes. The T3 meet and greet was staffed by very efficient and courteous people, seemed like another planet. Thankfully their pleasant efficient service meant I could leave the whole turgid place without any further delay. Will I travel from MIA again?, only drugged in a packing case.

This area was chaotic with 100's of people coming from several directions and was a shambles. It took 50 minutes to get through meanwhile our taxi was waiting for us. Having finally got through we went to collect our bags. We had an expensive matching set and 1 case had a 12 inch gash in it and was ruined. We went to baggage complaints and were treated almost rudely by 2 people who were more interested in their future shifts than helping us. It took almost as long to get through Manchester Airport as it did to fly from Spain. The airport caused a 30 minute delay on our departure. I think the airport management should read these reviews and do something to deal with these problems.,3.0

Arrived to the longest queue to border control I have ever experienced in all my international travel at any airport. To top it all the delays resulted in my wife having to pay £6.50 for parking.

Very few restaurants in the departure area with the exception of a new KFC, which at 10am in the morning is not what I would expect. Toilets were dirty (not like Terminal 1). The waiting area at departure gates could be better and appears outdated. Wifi was poor and did not work. Could not even access mobile data on my 4G enabled smart phone!

First, the member of staff directing people into passport lanes did not give consistent or clear instructions and reacted angrily and aburptly when people experienced technical issues. Second, the members of staff stood around doing nothing behind passport control where extremely rude when people were confused. For example, one member of staff told an individual to go to the exit infront of them rather than an alternative exit stating ""go to the exit it's obvious it says exit on it"". Third, there were 5 members of staff sat doing completely nothing behind the digital passport control service when systems instructed people encountering difficulties to seek assistance. No-one took the initiative to help people or speed-up the overall waiting time. These members of staff were just sat around watching some people struggle.

There was a long walk from the plane to baggage reclaim but it was a very short distance from baggage reclaim to the bus stop to get back to the long stay car park. Manchester Airport has undoubtedly been our best UK airport experience!",8.0
717,Manchester is the worst airport in the world I have visited. Airport management require a review of their process and staff both arriving and departing. Never ecountered such poor customer service - in fact there is none. I was delayed and nearly missed my flight because of smalll solid lipstick??,1.0
718,"Chaos and very stressful! Having flown from Manchester airport on a large number of occasions, I am appalled at the shambolic and ridiculous manner in which myself and my partner were treated at Terminal 1. From the moment of stepping out of the car and being told by airport staff that the company parking our car were horrendous and that our vehicle would be returned damaged, to shoes being damaged by airport security staff. Overall, it was a horrific start to the holiday we have been so looking forward to. The lack of any kind of customer service was appalling and not what I expected. I will never fly from this unorganised, disgraceful, dirty and extremely stressful airport. No customer should have to experience this absolute shambles, it is horrific.",1.0
719,"The worst airport experience I have had in the last 10 years. Used the meet & greet car parking at terminal 1. This was fully acceptable and was the only good part of my experience at the airport. Arrived just before 6am (had stayed locally and had no tea/coffee/breakfast at this point). Queued 35 minutes for baggage drop and another 30 minutes at security. The queues and methodology at security prevented me keeping an eye on my hand luggage/money/wallet/keys for several minutes. Very obviously there was not enough space for these functions. Then had to walk a considerable distance though wasted space (i.e. the duty free shop with no customers in it), before being able to get coffee and a bite to eat. Café was filthy both with uncleared/dirty tables and litter and food crumbs littering the floor. On return, huge queues for immigration. Was separated my wife and I were directed to separate e-passport checking booths. Wife got through easily and was then told to wait outside, and out of view. My passport was rejected (along with many others who had passports issued within the last few months) so was directed to a new queue for manual checking. Eventually met up again though wife was worried about being kept apart for so long. Overall, a most distressing experience. I will certainly fly from a different airport in future.",2.0
720,"Having just gone through security at terminal 1, I visited the toilets immediately after, opposite Starbucks and found them to be absolutely squalid. There was no loo roll, there were sanitary products overflowing from the bins, excrement on the outside of the toilet and the most disgusting smell! This is not the condition I expect to find the toilets in. They have been completely overlooked by cleaning staff and left to get into that state. Goodness only knows the last time they were cleaned.",2.0
721,"Can only echo the comments of others on here. Departing T1, arrived at airport a full 3 hours before departure. Queued 1 hour at Easyjet ""FAST bag drop"", where you actually had to print off your own luggage labels. Some machines were broken, and no one available to show confused passengers how to work them. Once through that chaos, you arrive at the shambles that is security. They were queueing just to get into the security area. Cramped and overcrowded and hot. The lines did not move, we waited for near 2 hours and was still only half way. The only way we got through was when someone called your flight number and for those passengers to come to the front. So with a differnet flight being called every 5 mins, you just moved until your flight was called. This left 10 mins to get to the plane, no time to shop, drink or anything. Uncomfortable and stressful is and understatement. I would love to get the CEO shadow me through a typical journey, he would be ashamed.",2.0
722,"The recent years I've been travelling on quite a regular basis from this airport. It is second to none when it comes to customer dissatisfaction. Being overcrowded and dirty is a minor flaw compared to the treatment of the customers. There are long queues to the security checks, I guess it is too complicated for them to count the available seats on departing aircrafts and staff accordingly. The staff have their own set of rules that only applies at that airport. Those rules are enforced in a rude and bullying manner. This airport should be used in management training as an example of how not to run an operation.",1.0
723,"As with review sites, the majority are always negative. Travelled through MAN on the 30th July through T2, couldn't fault anything. Check in took 5 minutes as there were plenty of desks open and I timed the queue for security (from Check in to the security scanners - 3 minutes and this was at 12.00). Airport was busy once through to the lounge however there are plenty of seats at the various gates, most people sit at gate 210 as it is the closest to Duty free then moan that there are not enough seats - just use your intelligence and walk to the next gate. Security - The majority of the people that moan about security queues are not prepared for security and once at the front will spend five minutes unpacking their bags and taking belts off etc. As long as people are prepared for security then there should be no delay. An unsually large amount of bags seem to get rejected at MAN (1 in 3) however there were plenty of polite (despite the other reviews) staff waiting to further search bags. Just because a couple of staff that you meet may not be polite doesn't mean that everybody is horrible. Arrival - Parked on stand 213 which is undergoing construction though there are covered walkways to the from the aircraft to the terminal. Passport control was empty (just after midnight) and the first bags were on the conveyor belt within around 10 minutes of leaving the aircraft. Though only half of the bags came through before a ten minute hiatus. The process of collecting bags was slowed by the scrum of people pushing as close to the conveyor as possible rather than standing behind the yellow line. All in all, 30 minutes from touchdown to arrivals. Can't complain. There are things that have been pointed out by others that have been improved. Tips 1) Be prepared for security - have your boarding pass ready to go through the barrier (one family was totally blocking the gates as the searched for their boarding cards). Also have all electronic devices within easy reach and take belts off prior to getting to the front of the queue. 2) Don't sit near gate 210 - you probably won't get a seat anyway. Gates 212-215 have plenty of seats. 3) Don't stop in the middle of the walkway through duty free and clog it up. Stand at the side. 4) On the return have passports out and ready for inspection (or face down onto the automatic scanners). 5). Stand behind the yellow line at baggage reclaim to prevent a scrum, it is quicker if everybody can see the bags and step forward when they are close.",9.0
724,"I am passing on this review from my parents who were apprehensive of their visit due to negative reviews. They had nothing but good things to say. Very quick and easy parking at T1 M&G. Next was the easy to find check in where typically they had packed over their weight limit, but upon hearing that they were going on holiday due to their 30th wedding anniversary, the lovely person at the check in desk waived the £12 charge! A wonderful gesture. Next came security - they were straight to the front of the queue, despite it being peak holiday season! My mother had her bag searched as she forgot that she left her hair straighteners in her hand luggage, she was expecting an annoyed security officer as she accepted she was daft to forget despite loads of signage, but nope, very understanding and polite. Finally, lots of shopping options, and an on time departure. What's not to like? Please bear in mind, these bad experiences are rare.",10.0
725,Manchester is the airport that once claimed it would 'never' facilitate budget airlines. Until they got greedy and decided to poach the latter from other local airports such as Blackpool and Liverpool. Resulting in closure of Blackpool and many routes transferred from Liverpool meaning much less choice. As a result. MAN has become overcrowded to the point of being a shambles. Toilets are dirty and seating is negligible. Queuing for security is a nightmare. Easyjet now have pax weighing and placing tickets on their own suitcase hold luggage. I only wish I didn't have to visit this place as often as I am forced to because of lack of choice for routes from Liverpool. Especially to Tenerife South which is only served by Ryanair and they are not a choice of mine.,4.0
726,"Manchester airport is all about profit. They do not care about their customers at all. Yes a new terminal in 2023 may be the answer to all the problems but as traffic increases year on year will it? It's dirty, toilets a disgrace, security and passport controls lack enough staff to cope at peak times. And even paying for fastrack is no better with a 40 minute wait. And now they are charging for fastrack through passport control. How will this work when the lines back up to the gates! I have no real option other than to fly from here. They have embraced new routes all the extra flights and arrivals but have not addressed or spent the extra funds needed to reduce the endless lines and filth. You are a disgrace.",2.0

Staff have never been rude to me because I am always polite to them. Maybe if more people were prepared when they arrive in security the delays would be less, I am tired of getting to the security lane and waiting whilst someone spends 5 minutes emptying their pockets, taking off their belts, looking for things in their bag. As for missing flights, whilst I was last there (and I fly from Manchester several times a year) they were calling people forward for flights that were due to depart.",8.0
729,"Absolutely the worst experience at this sad excuse of an airport. Arrived 4 hrs prior to take off as wanted to do some duty free shopping and grab breakfast. Queued for just over hour and half to drop bags off at Ryanair desk. Just 1 person checking everyone in. (3.30am). Finally got to security and it was like a scene from an army training camp. Staff yelling at people. Treating passengers like children. Shouting orders like they were running a boot camp. They had no idea what they were doing. Just kept yelling if you miss your flight it's our own fault? Guess this is a new script to pass the blame from the shambles over to passengers. Don't get me wrong I'm 101% behind security measures. But Manchester airport. You fail on customer service! I fly monthly and was prepared with my liquids in a clear bag ready for the search. No electricals on me. I even had my belt off ready! I politely said excuse me to your security officer who obviously has anger issues and advised her my plane was in the process of boarding, she cut me off mid sentance by yelling at me that I need to take my liquids out my bag and if I missed my flight it's my fault! Not sure why it would be my fault when I arrived in good time and was ready to pass through security hours before my flight? Maybe if the other guy on security hadn't shouted ""if it's got a plug on it take it out your bag"" is this a new security measure? Naturally this made things worse as people were taking hairdryers etc out their bags! I managed to get my flight. I work in the travel trade industry, I have to say if I was a foreign tourist visiting Manchester and my last experience of the UK was being yelled at and belittled by a jumped up woman with anger issues, I'd not hurry back. Manchester airport. You can't blame people for the delays. Other airports around the world manage and don't feel the need to belittle people. This experience will make me think twice about travelling through your airport. Liverpool/Leeds Bradford is not that far away. I'm sure the retailers who rent premises from you must not be impressed. While you are failing to get people through you're also removing time for people to shop and purchase Food and beverages. Great you're building a new terminal. But I'd spend some of that cash on investing in people and training.",1.0
730,Terrible. We nearly missed our flight due to taking nearly 3 hours to get through security. There appears to be only 5 of the security streams in use. Staff appeared to not care that we were going to miss our flight till the last minute. Had to run with no shoes on to get the flight. The duty free shops were empty (they must be happy). On the way back the queues to get through passport control were lengthy too. Not a good experience for visitors to the UK. Everything is shoddy. No hope of getting on the WIFI. We had rebooked our train tickets - thank goodness because guess what - yes an enormous wait for them too. What I don't understand is that the airport knows how many flights are leaving and how many passengers are expected and so could manage their staffing levels to ensure a smooth journey through the system. Not rocket science.,1.0
731,"Do not use this airport. The queues for the security are beyond a joke, I missed a flight because of this, and yes I arrived in plenty of time.

Told that the baggage was ready but no onr to load onto belt. Signs to car park even levels not visible from passenger exit. 3 lifts crammed full. Overall a dirty, shambolic, overcrowded, experience, one that I don't want to repeat. Feel sorry for Manchester folk having this monstrosity to represent their fine city.",2.0
733,"Avoid Manchester Airport at all costs. 12 x golfers arrival from Guernsey into a cramped and poorly laid out arrivals area wasn't too bad but expected as that hasn't changed in years. 4 Days later arriving at 17.25 (delayed due to traffic issues in and around the airport) for a 19.15 departure home the scene at departures was chaos. Fought our way to check in with airline (Aurigny) OK and as usual had to take clubs to oversized baggage station. On arrival confronted with queue of over 100 and after hanging around with no progress whatsoever for 15 minutes were advised that the scanner operator had been told to turn the machine off, he didn't know why or how the ever growing queue was going to be dealt with. Observations re the oversized baggage system. 1) No attempt to order the queue by priority i.e. who was travelling earlier than others. 2) Why is there only one oversized baggage scanner in departures, I understand there is another on a different floor but one of our party went to find this and it was not being manned. 3) As far as we can tell not all of those in the queue had oversized baggage, some of the items clearly were marginal at best? 4) Customer service were hiding to take cover from the mess unfolding before them presumably. After eventually winning the game of hide and seek and finding customer service staff and advising them that our party were now highly likely to miss our flight we were bought forward to the front on the queue much to annoyance of the ever growing hoards remaining behind. Next problem is the shambolic arrangements in security. A single queue snaking its way to a cramped checking area. This took an age and even when eventually dealt with there is no space to sort yourself out after the checks are completed. Exit security and loads of space to snake your way through endless samples of perfume and the like. Try treating your customers better early on the in the process and they may be inclined to spend money in your prison (sorry shopping area). Finally through to the gate and we can see our flight has arrived (on time) with the captain sat in the cockpit but despite the time now being nearly 7 the luggage has not yet been removed. We watch until eventually boarding at 7.45 to be advised by the captain that the reason for the delay was there was no one qualified to open the hold doors was available on arrival or for 20 minutes thereafter, you can't make this up! I suggest that the owners of Manchester airport take a look at security at Gatwick which from recent recollection is much better organised. We won't be back.",2.0

It was too hot with too many people crammed in to the security area. The security staff are also exceptionally rude, and impersonal. It is best described as mass confusion.

The very rude chap shouting at people didn't help, our trays ending up at different stations and being shunted from one section to the other was very unprofessional especially when on asking a question to staff they all seemed more interested in carrying on their own private conversations. The tall chap in the white shirt seemed to get a kick out putting peoples trays to the back of the line when they/us were panicking that we would miss flights.

There are so many issues, from lack of signage for rental cars to sluggish processing of non-UK citizens but the absolute worst experience for anyone travelling through here must be the departure security screening. Yes, it has to be done but how can so many other airports manage to make it a smooth process while Manchester fails so dismally? I departed on 17th June arriving 2 hrs 30 mins beforehand but found myself stuck in the queue for security screening for a full 2 hours! How can 3 workers (who were doing their best to keep up) be expected to process the hundreds of passengers from numerous flights? What a waste of money those 10 other unused screening positions were. Our flight eventually left over an hour late with the airline staff making apologies on behalf of the airport!

739,"I have lived all over the world, I've been in airports in countries such as Malaysia, Australia and Singapore but never in my life have I experienced a trip through any airport as I have many times at Manchester. I am from Manchester so I have nothing against the airport. But I am absolutely embarrassed to call this airport the airport representing my city. It is probably the most hectic and stressful airport I've ever been through in my entire life. As soon as you enter the airport you will understand what I mean. It is complete bedlam. Insanely long queues for basically anything you can think of. It is insane that every single time that I've been through this airport that I have been waiting in line and seen about 6 desks but only 1 person serving people, it is so incredibly frustrating. But probably the worst part of Manchester Airport is the security, I've known people who have missed flights because of it. They heard you like cattle and yell at you. It's constant yelling like a fish market. They are always aggressive and always cause it to take ages for you to get through. It is ridiculous. Word of warning to anyone flying into Manchester Airport. Don't put any luggage under the plane, only have a carry on for your own sanity. Every single time without failure at Manchester Airport no matter where you have flown from, whether it's nearest as Liverpool or as far away as Dubai or Australia. You will without a doubt have a long long long wait for your bags on the carousel. Because there simply aren't enough people working back there to get your bags to you on time. One time I waited along with my family after a long flight for almost 2 hours for our suitcases. But it wasn't just us. No suitcases came out at all during this time! So trust me when I say take a carry on and just stroll past the people who are stupid enough to put their precious bags in the hands of the workers (or lack of) at Manchester Airport. Also if your bag does go missing good luck getting it back. Customer service is terrible and they always say ""I don't know"". So to sum it all up, if you would like to be treated like cattle, yelled at, possibly miss your flight, wait for hours for bags, get your bags lost or stolen then by any means take a trip through Manchester Airport. But I am positive that unless completely necessary I will be avoiding this airport more than boyfriends avoid their crazy ex-girlfriends.",1.0

Joined a huge queue just to get in, it took us until 6.15am (1 hour 45 minutes) to pass through security, there were only three security lanes open out of 16 with hundreds of passengers all trying to make their way through, it was absolute chaos. When I spoke to a member of staff to say we had to board in five minutes he just laughed at me and said ""not to worry"". All the while staff seemed to be everywhere laughing and chatting in groups on aisles that were not even open! Bags were being fed down a different aisles to people so luggage/trays came out in a different order and place to where expected which just slowed down the process even more. We were then told by a Manager our flight had been delayed due to the amount of people stuck in security and when they came through to grab them and run! Our bags finally appeared but I was still waiting for a second tray containing all of my cosmetics and toiletries and expensive hair straighteners. We had to make a choice to wait for it and miss our flight or leave it and hopefully make it, we chose the latter. I am now on Honeymoon missing lots of my luggage. Other passengers on different flights missed their flights. Never have I seen such a disorganised mess, how can any airport screen that amount of passengers with only three lanes open! Do not fly from Manchester unless this issue is sorted as you run a very hight chance of missing you flight even if you arrive in plenty of time.",1.0

I was at the airport 3 hrs before the departure time with the intention of getting something to eat - had not eaten all day and ended up with no time.

What was irritating was to find at least four of the scanning machines sitting idle. Surely Manchester Airport have got the know how to bring all their facilities into use when customer numbers demand? The other interesting aspect of this queuing is that passengers have little or no time to spend time and money in the shops and restaurants in the terminal. I wonder if those clients of the airport,who doubtless pay hefty zone A rents for their shops and restaurants realise this and ever complain? The terminal needs a thoroughly good going over to improve this dreadful but necessary aspect of flying! Flying with Jet2.com was marginally quicker on another recent flight but the labryinthine route from ground to the main departure area was to say the least ludicrous! Returning was also marginally better once the eternal queue through passport control was negotiated.",3.0

745,"Arrival at Terminal 1 was utterly depressing. The pier was shabby and dated with shoddy signage, low ceilings, and not particularly clean. Worse was to come at immigration with its confusing layout and far too many people being funnelled into an inadequate, stuffy space. Departing from Terminal 1 was just as bad but this time the longest queues were at security followed by entry into an overheated, noisy, scruffy departure lounge with inadequate seating. When I was at university in Manchester in the 1970s I had a summer job as a baggage handler/porter at Manchester airport and it is sad to see that Terminal 1 has remained much as it was 40 years ago with little effort having been made to improve passengers' experience apart from the obvious desire of management to maximise profits through cramming in as much retail activity as possible.

750,"My wife and I arrived at Manchester Airport T1 on Friday 16th June 2017 at approximately 6.00pm, and were immediately struck by the masses of people queuing to enter the building. We put this down to it being a busy Friday evening and thought no more of it. We went to the Aer Lingus desk and checked in our luggage, and within a couple of minutes approached the security screening area. We were horrified to see the massive crowds of people queuing to enter security. Thankfully, we had access to the Fast Track security and we entered and joined a queue. This queue moved incredibly slowly and it took almost 90 minutes to finally clear security. This was Fast Track, and we heard passengers in the other queue saying that they had waited over two and a half hours. During this time, there were numerous announcements advising passengers to remove devices, etc from bags so as to speed up the security process. What a joke! At no time was there any announcement to explain this delay. We were confined inside a very hot area with no cool air, no offer of drinks of water (this was especially shameful as there were many elderly and pregnant passengers in this very uncomfortable area. When we finally reached the screening area, I was met by a very friendly operative whom I asked the reason for this delay. He explained that it was due to the airport being very busy. This is totally unacceptable: Airport management have information on the precise number of passengers due to check in at any given time. That such a large crowd was allowed to congregate in the departures area was a serious health hazard. Being confined in a very warm airless area with no access to water, and being denied the most basic information is a dreadful way to treat paying customers. In all my time travelling through airports (including the USA post 9/11) I have never had such a terrible experience. The management of Manchester Airport should hang their heads in shame at this debacle. My wife and I both love visiting the UK.

752,"For those who crave disappointment Manchester Airport is for you. For charter flights it's the airport equivalent of toothache where the passenger has the dubious privilege of paying for appalling standards. What other sphere of activity is it OK to charge for a knowingly poor service? The reviews over months are mostly pretty bad, common issues coming up again and again. Note to the airport: why not use some of the trumpeted £2 billion spend to sort out the easy-to-remedy stuff first? Do something about smelly toilets, empty soap dispensers, slow baggage, access staircases that work, are easy to position and ready for an on-time flight. We've used the airport many occasions over the years and our opinions of the place has lowered each time. Repeated mentions about clunky check-ins, unexplained queues, tortuous security control, upstairs / downstairs / round-the-houses walks, unavoidable travel through the 'duty free' perfume arcade on way to departure. Manchester Airport bills itself 'global gateway for the North of England' we arrived on-time Bilbao last Tues [20 Jun] and had to wait 10 mins for the steps to be wheeled in [it took 2 goes]. This was better than experience a week before on a flight from Nice where passengers were kept waiting 20 mins. We were ushered through a narrow litter-strewn passageway through a sliding door that opened and closed sporadically splitting up families. This little insight says it all. One of the first things you see on the Manchester Airport website is an invitation to pay £6 to fast-track book in. Not only is the airport aware that check-in is slow but rather than sort it out no – it's opportunity to further milk the punters! I'm sure the internal debate went along the lines: how much can charge for a service that other airports of a similar size do as standard for nothing? Others like Stansted [same group] charge £7 and Gatwick [a mere £5] both advertise the same service although not quite as rapaciously. The 3rd largest airport in the country is a disgrace.",1.0

Do something about smelly toilets, empty soap dispensers, slow baggage, access staircases that work are easy to position and ready for an on-time flight. We've used MA many occasions over the years and our opinions of the place has lowered each time. Repeated mentions about clunky check-ins, unexplained queues [lots], tortuous security control, upstairs/downstairs/round-the-houses walks, unavoidable travel through the 'duty free' perfume arcade on way to departure. Manchester Airport bills itself 'global gateway for the North of England' we arrived on-time Bilbao last Tues [20 Jun] and had to wait 10 mins for the steps to be wheeled in [it took 2 goes]. This was better than experience a week before on a flight from Nice where passengers were kept waiting 20 mins. We were ushered through a narrow litter-strewn passageway through a sliding door that opened and closed sporadically splitting up families. This little insight says it all. One of the first things you see on the Manchester Airport website is an invitation to pay £6 to fast-track book in. Not only is the airport aware that check-in is slow but rather than sort it out no – it's opportunity to further milk the punters! I'm sure the internal debate went along the lines: how much can charge for a service that other airports of a similar size do as standard for nothing? Others like Stansted [same group] charge £7 and Gatwick [a mere £5] both advertise the same service although not quite as blatantly. The 3rd largest airport in the country is a disgrace.",1.0
754,"I was about give this airport a very bad review, but having read previous reviews it is obviously famous as one of the worst if not the worst airports in the UK and therefore the world. It is an utter disgrace without adequate public seating no public telephones and dirty I arrive from Bangkok and Dubai airports, both of which are world standard. I suggest the people of Manchester rise up in fury to be disgraced by this shambles which is so bad it makes Heathrow look adequate.",1.0
755,Horrendous queues for security at Manchester Airport. Only electronic gates for boarding pass scanning and they kept closing them down as there were too many passengers! Queues for over 1.5 hours just to get to the security desks. Then stood for 19 mins in a queue to order breakfast to be told there would be a 30 min wait for food. Ended up queuing for 20 mins at Costa Coffee and then to be told we couldn't take the drinks onto the plane and the gate was now closing. Will seriously consider advising folk to travel from alternate airports (Leeds/Bradford and Liverpool much easier.),2.0
756,"I travel out of Manchester Airport T3 a lot and every time it gets worse. The check in process through customs is borderline aggressive and the staff snap at you. Most people at an airport are going on holiday and this just makes it start off on a bad note. Then the main area and the lounges, most of the time the air conditioning does not work so having spent up to an hour waiting to get through customs in hideous heat, you then move into even more unpleasant heat. The Escape lounge charge £27 for entry which is fine until you the find out they have no aircon and you sit there getting hotter and hotter. If you use the main area you can wait up to an hour for a table for food or 45 mins just to get a drink at the bar. The place clearly cannot cope with the volume and that should be addresses. I think the worst part for me is the customs area where the staff are rude, aggressive and totally unhelpful. I watched a man try and explain to someone that his wallet had not come through the scanner to be told - then to a desk and log it - then totally ignored. I have travelled in third world places where the experience is far greater than at Manchester T3. The place is often very dirty also, the toilets usually with no loo paper and no soap.",1.0

758,I never look forward to travelling through Manchester Airport because going through their security is such an unpleasant experience. I appreciate that security is vital for all our safety but the manner which the staff process the passengers is inefficient and verging on aggressive. Is it necessary for passengers to feel intimated and threatened by the a simple search. I would advise passengers to go via Liverpool or avoid terminal one at all costs. I have travelled to / from Belfast at the height of the troubles and have never experienced such intense scrutiny where the staff duplicate the searches. Are the surely staff trying to ensure that they have continued employment? In the summer their procedures lead to massive queues of over 3 hours. During the summer I arrive close to departure time because they always allow you to jump the queue. The businesses in the airport must hate security because passengers have less time to shop. EasyJet has moved many domestic flights to terminal 1 could I please beg them to return to terminal 3. Arrival at terminal 1 on a domestic flight requires the passengers to be bussed to the exit. This can take over 15 mins. Why in this day and age does it take so long. easyJet go back to terminal 3. Terminal 1 has a very limited number of seats instead of sitting on the floor go to Liverpool.,2.0
759,"On the day when Manchester airport has featured in the news as one of the worst in the world, I feel that I should review it, and capture the good and the bad. We travelled to and from Manchester in March (Berlin short break) and to and from Croatia (Dubrovnik for 1 week) in May. We're travelling again to Greece in August. Absolutely no issues with departure either time on our recent jaunts. Good bag drop and check in when we needed it. There is a difference between T1 and T2 on departure (bigger international flights leave from T2), and perhaps we were fortunate to have travelled early morning on both occasions. Yes, it took a while to clear security both times, and on the Berlin trip I was taken aside for a while for a completely justified reason, but no dramas. Both terminals are OK for us. The main bar in T2 has been re-fitted, and we thought it was a massive improvement. Yes, the food is expensive, but most of us aren't here for long. Decent screen updates in both terminals on departure, and boarding was fine. The problem when using this airport is invariably the return. Coming back from Berlin not too bad, but returning to T2 in May was embarrassing. All of the EU residents queued at the biometric scanners with constant shouting about where to stand/which lane to use. All this whilst watching a handful of non EU folk having a pleasant chat with immigration at an adjacent desk and largely being waved through. This says a fair bit about our country right now. Appreciate that immigration is a Border Agency issue, but several in our queue commented about feeling like 2nd class citizens, and having to wait 45 to 50 minutes to clear immigration. (When we live here). On a personal note, we had plans to get to Old Trafford for the match, and only just made it. Had we arrived on a middle east / Asian flight, we would probably have had considerably more time to get onto the Metrolink. Maybe will get worse, or maybe actually better when we Brexit as something will have to speed up, or the airport will grind to a halt. Departure no worse than many places. This airport has to look at what people see on arrival as it does not show our city in a great light.

760,"I agree with most of the recent reviews. Baggage Drop is chaotic, security on return is ludicrous, huge qeues and not enough scanners for everyone with the latest passport chips, doors that close to cut off families and filthy approaches to the terminal doors, in terminal one at least. I have landed there twice in 2 weeks and on both cases the steps did not work properly so we were stuck on the plane. Baggage reclaim has been the worst in the country for years. Toilets were filthy and soap dispensers and driers did not work. It has just been ranked the 3rd worst airport in the world, how can Gatwick and Kuwait possibly be worse. Heads should roll!",1.0
761,"My wife and I arrived at Manchester Airport T1 on Friday 16th June 2017 at approximately 6.00pm, and were immediately struck by the masses of people queuing to enter the building. We put this down to it being a busy Friday evening and thought no more of it. We went to the Aer Lingus desk and checked in our luggage, and within a couple of minutes approached the security screening area. We were horrified to see the massive crowds of people queuing to enter security. Thankfully, we had access to the Fast Track security and we entered and joined a queue. This queue moved incredibly slowly and it took almost 90 minutes to finally clear security. This was Fast Track, and we heard passengers in the other queue saying that they had waited over two and a half hours. During this time, there were numerous announcements advising passengers to remove devices, etc from bags so as to speed up the security process. What a joke! At no time was there any announcement to explain this delay. We were confined inside a very hot area with no cool air, no offer of drinks of water (this was especially shameful as there were many elderly and pregnant passengers in this very uncomfortable area. When we finally reached the screening area, I was met by a very friendly operative whom I asked the reason for this delay. He explained that it was due to the airport being very busy. This is totally unacceptable: Airport management have information on the precise number of passengers due to check in at any given time. That such a large crowd was allowed to congregate in the departures area was a serious health hazard. Being confined in a very warm airless area with no access to water, and being denied the most basic information is a dreadful way to treat paying customers. The management of Manchester Airport should hang their heads in shame at this debacle. My wife and I both love visiting the UK. On foot of our experience today, we will certainly think twice about flying out of Manchester.",1.0

To check in there is one particularly irksom practice where if you have a ""soft"" or ""small"" bag you get to wait in a separate line after checking to drop off your bag. If you happen to wait in line at the same time as the flight crew you will be rudely moved to the back of the line. Similar treatment is received at the very limited selection of restaurants. If you are picking up or dropping off a rental car be prepared to spend more time waiting on infrequent busses to the ""rental car village"" where by and large you will be treated poorly as described above. You do not want to be at this airport if you are in a hurry. As far as the airport itself it is old, dirty, and noisy. To get to the gates you will need to walk through a rather tasteless mall area smelling of all varieties of perfume and alcohol. I would suggest avoiding this airport if possible.",1.0

768,Simply the worst airport I have ever had the misfortune to use worldwide and I am a regular traveller. Security at T2 was a complete and utter shambles with full body searches of bona-fide travellers and baggage searches that would embarrass even the most vigilent customs rummage crew. Two complete bag searches which completely destroyed my packing only to find absolutely nothing except what they thought was a lip balm but was actually a solid and not subject to the rules. These nonsensical searches added at least 40 minutes to my transit time even after passing through the scanner. This is nothing to do with actual security but a charade to make it look that they are doing something. Then to have to run the gaunlet of so called duty free to reach departures is another joke in itself. Airside is no better with nothing more than junk food outlets and a downmarket bar.,1.0

Flew through passport control as there were only 3 people in the queue in front of us. Friendly border force staff, greeted with a smile. Great experience all round.

Also had to remove a tag heuer watch and put it in the tray. Handy for someone to steal as I'm waiting on the other side of security as it goes through scanner. I had to wait 30 minutes for my bag to be searched while holding my liquids, jacket, hairdryer and kindle. Manchester really needs to sort this out. My watch never beeps in airports.

774,"I use this airport regularly as I return home to visit family, but have never bothered reviewing as I didn't want to post something negative in the hope that it might improve in due course. Sadly, this has not happened for around 8 years now and most recent reviews are right on the money - while check-in staff aren't too bad, the mess begins at security with horrific queuing (even with babies or small children, although if you bother to ask for yourself you may be allowed into a quicker line despite initially being channelled in with the masses) and a distinct lack of clarity of understanding between staff overseeing the lines. And this is before the screening procedure even begins, at that point, you will be ""greeted"" by rude, pretentious, patronising and poorly trained staff who bark at passengers (and sometimes to each other) as if we are schoolchildren. How some of these guys are allowed to work anywhere at all is a wonder to me. During busy times, only around half of the scanning ""desks"" seemed to be open (why?), leading to a fair bit of chaos if any items (and there seemed to be a lot) have to be rescanned for one reason or other. With this mess you would expect there to be at least a competent surveillance system in place. Seemingly not. Due to a screaming toddler - thanks to the moronic staff for making matters significantly worse on that front by ignoring advice and trying to interact with said toddler, despite repeated requests not to - I left 3 items in one of the trays there. This tray was not to be seen with my other items and so I left it as an oversight (my fault admittedly). It contained a laptop and two cameras. The laptop and one camera were recovered via LuggagePoint. The second (and larger) camera that was in the same tray, somehow disappeared. How did the other items make it to lost property? Surely CCTV should pick this up or at least give us some indication? Apparently not, as the images weren't clear enough to see. It really is that easy to walk off with someone else's property at the security screening despite there being multiple CCTV cameras in the vicinity. Unbelievable. Once you've finally escaped and made your way through to the shopping/refreshment areas things don't get much better. Eating options are sadly limited (not a massive issue for short flights which typically depart terminal 3) and there aren't screens in convenient areas showing you your gate number - you shouldn't have to go right through to a bar area to see one of these! Oh and good luck trying to find a clean toilet/baby change facility before your flight. Seating at the gate seemed to be ample though. So it's not all doom and gloom. Departing the city of my birth used to be a slightly sad experience, but the idiocy of the airport staff ensure this is no longer the case. Such a shame that they do not represent the people of Manchester as a whole. I live in hope that someone sees sense and completely overhauls the airport and its practices, but I don't expect it to happen at any time soon.

The toilet facilities are hopelessly inadequate - too few, too small and too smelly. Every inch of available floor space is given over to retail outlets, with traveller comfort coming a long way down the list of priorities. On departure, the baggage check/security arrangements are a shambles and a nightmare, overcrowding, staff inefficiency and staff hostility all contribute to an painfully slow process and a genuinely unpleasant experience. On arrival, the queue at passport control was enormous and moved at a glacial pace. To top it all, there's even a charge for baggage trolleys. What kind of a cheapskate operation is this?

First I acknowledge the toilet refurb in T1. I have IBS. I'm middle aged. I'm tall and over weight. If you can accommodate me then 99% of people are covered. Arrivals, after security the toilets, the seats and cubicals are too small. I can't actually use them. The disabled one was locked. I then went to the other side to luggage 6 area toilets and used the disabled one. I don't use airplanes toilets only in dire circumstances. The sinks are great. Hand driers you inserts your hands in are never clean looking 6 months down the line. I prefer paper towel. It's hygienic. I noticed in Departures the toilets were not being cleaned. Many were dirty and the room smelt. You could smell it in the hallway. These toilet cubicals were good size. Toilets were small but with room in the cubical it makes it easier to use them. Going to and from gates. The stairs kill me. They are steep, uneven, the floors are uneven. There is no room to walk around people. Toilets in these areas are too small. Gate 22 example. Staircases are narrow. Security departures. I get scared when I have to wait there with so many people for a long period of time before x-ray. I hope you change it to several security areas. I get searched almost everytime because of my bra. I understand why but I feel singled out because of my weight. After you get through it's madness. People have no room to get belongings together. Arrival passport control is a huge cattle gate. You get dizzy going through. Its narrow. I always catch my suitcase on the barriers. The last 3 rows are fixed. Why? Machines are getting better but you need more. Departures shopping concourse. Again you feel like cattle. Aisles are narrow. poor artifical lighting. Low ceilings and claustrophobic. Liverpool airport is much nicer layout. Again think of the Trafford centre. It's a shopping area, make it feel like one. Wifi is very poor. Worst I've experienced. Zurich, Helsinki or Vienna airports are good examples of what it should be like. You want to encourage people to use their phones but if they can't pull up their travel documents it won't work. Customer Service is rarely manned. Where is it? Unless you look for it you wouldn't know. Departure boards. Need to be larger print. Think Euston Station. That is easy to read from any angle. The boards outside the shops are good. I would like to see some healthy food options too. Smoothies, salads, soups for example. Also why not wok to go, subway or Nandos if it has to be a chain? In front of Arrivals and departures. Inside, its claustrophobic and dark and congested. People go through to get to departures. People queue directly across the path of the door for parking. People are everywhere standing like statues you need to navigate around to get to the lifts. Very badly laid out. It was the cleanest I've ever seen it before last time I was there. It's not pretty and functionally it's a mess. Outside isn't any better. Smokers congregate in front of the doors. There are conrete blocks to trip over. A huge hut blocking access to the ramp. Stairs. Why? Everyone has luggage. Move the smokers away from the main doors. Move the taxis further on. The hut in the middle blocks the path to the car park and buses. It also blocks natural light.

So of course, people are suddenly criss-crossing each other at the end of the run in chaotic fashion. Then you must work your way through metal barriers rather like sheep do until you finally emerge, hungry and tired. Luckily, you are met with a fantastic array of restaurants – Greggs Bakery and Joe’s Kitchen which serves a few croissants. But don’t worry both can seat about 50 people (combined)! What sort of impression does this give an international traveler, especially one with a few kids in tow? Apart from the instinct to get back on the plane, it is probably a mixture of bewilderment and a sense you have arrived at one of the UK’s train stations, not an international airport. As I write this, I am sat in Greggs waiting for my delayed flight. The place is a pigsty with no litter bins in sight. Therefore coffee cups and discarded paper bags are left strewn around. What is disappointing most about this is the missed opportunities Manchester faces. Many companies would be queuing up to house a restaurant in the airport, with millions of potential customers who have little choice but to use the eateries on offer. Is this the best the UK can serve up?",1.0
791,"Never again will I book a trip through Manchester airport. I thought Paris was bad but Manchester is a disaster. The security check takes forever, I walked miles through the zig zag lines. You don't have to remove your shoes but forget to remove a tablet from your carry on and you can stand there forever to get searched. If your renting a car and it's raining you will get soaked getting to the shuttle bus to the car rental village. Once at the car rental village with paper work done you get wet again getting to the car. I flew from Las Vegas to Manchester and back with Thomas Cook and the experience in Manchester airport spoiled the whole trip. The staff hated their jobs and seemed determined to make life miserable for everyone.",3.0
792,"I never write reviews but Manchester Airport warrants a review. My pregnant wife requested a pat-down instead of going through x-ray machine (had a letter from the doctor). They punished her by forcing her to go through a metal detector, into a backroom where they used a wand on all parts of her body with special focus on her stomach. This was in a room filled with lockers (tons of metal) for over 20 minutes. The wand couldn't handle all the metal, but the woman scanning my wife insisted anyway. They then double checked her passport and boarding pass even though that had already been done at the check-in and at the initial part of the security line. Many passed through the metal detector instead of the x-ray machine (myself included), but my wife was ""special"" because she refused the x-ray machine so she received an extra wand ""treatment"" in addition to going through the metal detector. We flew via this airport a couple of years ago as well. They singled me out because I had baby food with me for my baby (which I was holding). I had to go through their scanners, get a pat down and speak with a manager. I tried asking if I could just leave the food because I would lose my flight. They insisted because of ""protocol."" Meanwhile, my wife went to the gate to wait for me. Security was so slow that we lost our plane. They use protocols as their excuses for making your life difficult. Everything gets flagged on the conveyor belt and so you have to wait extra long in the line through security. Count on at least an hour to go through security for a tiny airport. Terrible layout, confusion everywhere. Boy did we make a mistake by thinking that ""a couple of years"" would make a difference.",1.0

I was told to follow signs for Terminal 3, when you are in a hurry and very short of time this kind of stress is something I could have done without, absolutely unbelievable.

The security line was so long and as other revies have mentioned full of staff shouting at passengers like they were naughty children. This airport is a disgrace, and the staff we encountered were rude and unprofessional, all the other airports we encountered face the same issues with security and seem to manage much better.

798,"Since December 2016 and the introduction at Terminal 2 of body scanners as part of security this process has become more arduous and intrusive than ever. I accept the need for proper security measures but the intrusive way in which they are now carried out is an infringement of personal liberty. On two occasions since then my wife and I have passed through this terminal and the body scanners and then for unexplained reasons been searched in such a way that it amounts to intrusion. If the body scanners are working properly there should be no need for a further full body search and certainly without a basic level of courtesy. The body scanners are clearly causing chaos and long queues which then results in large numbers of passengers being diverted through the original scanners which rather defeats the object. What would be far more sensible is if passengers went through the basic scanner first and then if anything was detected be asked to use the body scanner. Unfortunately, like professionalism, common sense seems to have deserted the staff and management at this airport. Even when you complain there and then or to the head office the response is always negative and one is made to feel as if you have no rights and no justification for complaining. Indeed when complaining to the CEO you are lucky if you get an acknowledgement without having to send at least one reminder - there is no point going to customer services since they never respond. The staff on duty at security are often rude and I have observed on many occasions that they behave unprofessionally. Little wonder that this is carried over to the attitude to passengers. Moreover the managers on duty are generally standing about by the desk at the end of the conveyor system where baggage is scanned taking no interest in what is happening at the entry point of security or how the staff are behaving. One last point, don't bother purchasing the fast-track vouchers. The access is often combined with Priority queue in which passengers with children are automatically herded and it can take longer to transit than just going trough the normal channels. In short this airport is a disgrace and without doubt the worst we have ever used. Avoid it if you can.",1.0

In the beginning I thought it might improve since there has been construction work going on for a while now, but it definitely does not improve, it gets worse. I don't know how a person who has trouble walking would ever be able to fly from this airport since there is always at least one flight of steep stairs involved where ever you go. I always struggle with just my little hand luggage suitcase to get up and down those stairs. Security mostly takes at least 45 minutes, because there will only be 2 or 3 security lanes open for all flights leaving the terminal.

Just a shameful experience, the folks on the continent or in the USA do it all so much more efficiently and dare I say pleasantly. The entry back into the UK (our own country) was shambolic, with long, long lines at passport control. Only 3 desks being manned by bored, listless border control officers who looked like they were dead from the neck up. Eventually more desks were open, but it took far too long to get through this mind numbing process. They simply have to do better!

When I said no, he lied and said no customs officer was available at the manned desks. After saying I would wait, he immediately opened a lane and I walked to the desk were a customs officer had been waiting all the time.

With only a small carry on rucksack, this should have been plenty of time to enjoy a pre-flight drink and some relaxed airport shopping. Not a chance. The queue seemed to meander endlessly around the security area. We finally passed through the x-ray machines 55 minutes after joining. Not a pleasant experience and made worse by the fact that the staff are constantly shouting instructions as if addressing children in a playground. This does not happen at other UK airports or any other European ones. Very strange. Then there is the issue of staffing levels. I don't claim to know how to run an airport but I would guess that a Friday afternoon is one of the busiest times with worker returning home and weekenders flying off for a break. It is therefore difficult for a lay person to comprehend why, when there are 12 security stations with x-ray machines, only 4 are open and staffed. If it is lack of trained staff then employ more. Or is it that passenger comfort is unimportant. It is not a pleasant experience and not a great start to a holiday.

809,"My family and I had an appalling experience at Manchester T3 security. We ended up missing not one, but two flights. By far it was the worst airport experience of my life. In general security at MAN appears to focus on punishment rather than proactively helping a family that is running things a bit tight. I complained and got a reply which stated that ""we were processed in a timely manner"" according to their data. Either I was lying, or the data was incorrect. You can make your own mind up. Here's what happened: Things started off well. The line was quite short (~10 people) and we passed through the scanner OK. However, it then immediately became clear that we had a problem. Our bags were stuck getting through the scanner. This was because the scanner was blocked as the “side channel” for bags requiring inspection was backed up. In fact it had overflowed onto about four trolleys. I’d estimate there were about 12 trays requiring inspection, and about 12 trays stuck trying to get through the scanner. We were becoming mildly stressed but waited patiently since we still appeared to have plenty of time. Also, I knew that our gate was very close. Surely the staff had a process for dealing with the backlog/spreading the load across multiple security lanes? The answer turned out to be no and we missed our flight. At no point did anyone check with the passengers if anybody was on an immediate flight. This is standard procedure at many airports I have flown from. At no point did the staff appear to raise the situation to their managers. At no point was it suggested we try a different line. In any case our bags were stuck in the scanner. We mentioned to the staff several times that we were going to miss the flight. Their replies ranged from ""sorry love, nothing we can do"" to blank stares. A manager did not appear until another passenger went to the control booth where 3 managers/officers were chatting. No attempt was made by that manager to assess the situation and investigate if any passengers were in danger of missing their flight. Finally we got through and raced to our gate to no avail. The gate had closed and we got yelled at my an incredibly rude member of Manchester airport staff. Anyway, we needed to re-check-in and that is when things started to get surreal. A member of BA staff was assigned to guide us to get our bags from ""carousel 3"". Unfortunately he messed up and took us to international baggage reclaim where there was no ""carousel 3"". We were stuck. Of course, there was no access from international / domestic and we couldn't go back through immigration. It took 30+ minutes to resolve the issue and we missed the next flight too. To top it all, as we waited for the 3rd flight, we took our kid to the children's play area which turned out to be disgracefully dirty. It was covered in food spills, crumbs, and litter. I’m a proud Mancunian, now living in San Francisco, and I want to sell my home city as somewhere that my friends should visit. I would love them to be able to fly directly to the North of England to visit the Lake District and North Yorkshire without dealing with a change in London. However, based on our experiences, I’m wary of doing that. The airport is an embarrassment.",1.0

Thaings started badly as the Skylink moving walkway from our hotel was out of action (It was still not working on our return four weeks later). Getting through a seriously understaffed security check took over two hours and finding our way to departures involved being forced through a circuitous route through duty free. What is that all about? This really got my back up and ended up with me shouting at one of the assistants ""Just tell me where the planes are?"" When will UK airports realise that we use airports to travel on planes, not to shop. Instead of breakfast we only had time for a quick coffee in a hot, over crowded and far too small cafe, before the long walk to the gate. Manchester Airport further sought to annoy us on our return by charging a non-refundable fee for the use of a luggage trolley. To get my own back for this money grabbing initiative I left the trolley in an awkward area out of site on the railway platform - serves you right Manchester bean counters. By contrast the other airports used on our trip (Tokyo, Narita, Abu Dhabi and Singapore) were exceptionally clean, well staffed, efficient and provided (free) services that Manchester probably has never dreamed of. Neither did any of these airports insist of liquids being separately shown, iPads/phone being out of luggage, shoes being removed, belts being taken off, water bottles being left behind.

Fifty minutes later I with my flight 10 minutes from take off they got to my equipment. The lady looked for the reason my shoes and belt had been targeted for an extra check, no not my bag which had got through just my suspicious looking shoes and belt. The lady couldn't find the reason, looked slightly embarrassed and said it had been pulled by mistake and to her credit apologised. I then mentioned this to the supervisor that it was their error I'd missed my flight but was met the comment ""we don't make mistakes"". An apology would have been reasonable.

This seems to be the driving force behind the OOT security, winning awards, not helping the general public get through security with as little hassle as possible. An unfortunate gentleman in front of me had a small custom made in wallet bottle opener which had been a gift from his daughter, not sharp, not a deadly weapon but the security took it and he was obviously upset as he had travelled through many airports previously without a problem with it.

However the voice continued to get louder and more aggressive. Finally we arrived at the machines. As nobody was giving instructions here people were walking slowly past. Then we were told to enter the booths and put our passports photo down. Some people had walked past the first machines by then and had to double back causing confusion. This seemed to irritate the member of staff who reprimanded us and was very patronising in his instructions, all the time reminding us of the impeding 2000 people. Several people needed help and were given verbal instructions by a different staff member on how to place the passport, remove glasses and hats etc. There was a lot of repetition and progress was slow. I couldn't understand why there were no signs up telling people how to use the machines. It was obvious that most of the people had not used them before and needed to be supported not insulted or belittled. As we left I looked back at the staff member who was so concerned about how he would cope with the imminent 2000 only to find him with his arms folded chatting.

I flew out on early afternoon Sunday 27th November, it should have been a relatively quiet time to pass through security but given the complete incompetence of the staff and management in the security hall they manage to turn what should be a 15 minute experience into a 45 minute nightmare.

There are countless reviews condemning the management of the facility, do they listen - no, it just seems to get worse and worse. My bag was pulled out for a hand search - 1½ staff members seemed to be dealing with our x-ray machine, it took 30 minutes to search a bag and all they wanted to do was swab it! The supervisor was arrogant and content to blame the passengers for all the problems! Didn’t seem to think that the lack of staff or the lack of open x-ray machines had anything to do with it. Where do they find these people? If you have the misfortune to have to travel through T3 make sure that you allow at least an hour to get through security.

I have seen the flat walking escalator deposit people into the back of an existing queue with people piling up on top of each other. The escalator was stopped by a passenger pressing the emergency stop. No apology for injuries no representative there? The border control staff they really need to consider other employment because they are most miserable group of people I have ever met. You would think that they controlling a border on foot in the cold and rain not sitting at a nice warm desk.

After clearing the control I see my bag coming out and the tray with my seperated liquids beeing put on the line for the extra checks. I was nervous, since it was 40 minutes to departure (I had waited one hour in line already). After 10 minutes and the staff chatting with a passenger who seemed to have lots of time I asked if I could have my tray checked, since i'm afraid to miss my plane. Of course thats not possible, one by one. 15 more minutes later my tray gets picked up and I report to the lady that will check it. Apparently the hood of my jacket fell over the seperated bag of liquids I had in the tray, and that seems to be a big no no in MAN. No one told me I shouldn't put anything above the liquids. This has never happened at any other airport, staff working very slowly and chatting the whole time. The airport itself is fine, but the situation at security is really unberable.

We're talking about bags and content which had already passed several security checks via other airports - without any problems - Well not in MAN it seems. So if you can't avoid this place completely then at least get there early and know in advance that you will be herded like cattle and will feel like a criminal as staff go through your bags in great detail and perform swab test your hands, clothes etc. It might be worth paying for checked in luggage to avoid this excuse for service. In many years of traveling airports worldwide I've never seen anything quite this bad.",2.0
830,"Majority of staff at Manchester Airport are absolutely awful. If there was another choice of airport locally this airport would close within 6 months. Most of the staff are rude, uninterested and are not embarrassed about showing their contempt and disrespect to travellers. I believe a new terminal is to be built, what a waste of money. A better plan would be to retrain or replace the staff first then look at the buildings. Manchester airport is lucky it hasn't any local competition and should never expand till it's root problems are solved.",1.0
831,Check in with Jet2 and security was a breeze at Manchester Airport. We had paid extra for the Escape lounge only to find that it wasn't as advertised and the better quality food was chargeable. Complete waste of money. On return from our untroubled holiday with Jet2 we then had to wait for over an hour for our luggage to come off the plane. There was no rep around to let us know what the delay was and we were just expected to wait by the carousel. Manchester airport is terrible for baggage delivery - it takes forever every time I come through. If I could use a different airport I would. A massive dampener on the end of your hard earned holiday.,1.0
832,"Truly awful experience. Having entered security on 3/11/16 at 07.00, I placed my possessions in the plastic trays for X-Ray processing as required, went through the body scanner and emerged to find my travel documents had disappeared in the 30 seconds since I'd last seen them. Upon querying this with the nonplussed security officials I was met with disinterest and disbelief. They thought I had lost them and initially refused to lift a finger to assist me. Obviously without these documents (passport and boarding pass) I was going nowhere. I was extremely worried. A search was made of the X-ray scanner equipment to see if they'd somehow dropped out, and the plastic trays were searched, but given the chaotic scenes it was difficult to get anything done. I was further searched to see if my documents were about my person, despite insisting that I'd put them through the scanner. My brand new RFID tag (metal) passport wasn't visible on the recorded X-ray machine images (why not?) - and this further led them to believe that I had simply ""lost"" them. I was searched (again) and two beach bats were confiscated from my hand baggage - just to add insult to injury. How many times do you need to be searched at Manchester? They'd already been cleared by X-ray. Eventually they deigned to examine the CCTV footage and this took some time. I persuaded my partner to leave for departures in the meantime in the belief that he would have to leave alone if my documents weren't found in time - this was particularly distressing. After around 40 minutes, and with only around 10 minutes before final boarding, the security officials declared that they believed the passenger in front of me had taken them, probably in error. They ran to departures and got Ryan air to hold the flight. They located the passenger with my documents - his own being in his hand baggage - and yes, benefit of doubt, he had probably picked them up in error in the confusion that is evident around this appalling, cattle market of a security area. I was repatriated with them with seconds to spare before the departure gates closed. A truly awful start to the holiday and it should never have happened. It shouldn't be possible that this can occur in this high security area and to confiscate my personal goods after I was searched really grieved me. I honestly thought the experience was a disgrace. However my thanks to security official Paul Schofield who did his level best to assist and I have to thank him for interrogating the CCTV and establishing the actual circumstances, then locating the errant passenger with my documents. Well done Paul, but my view of Manchester airport is forever sullied.",1.0
833,"This airport continues to be the worst I have experienced in the UK for customs control queues, the response is always ""there has been a higher number of planes landing than expected at this time"". However I find it hard to believe on six occasions the same thing happens - maybe I'm just unlucky. Recently (midnight on a Sunday night) 3 planes land and 5 e-passport stations open results in queuing in excess of 45 mins, and no disability or small children lanes is unacceptable.",1.0
834,"I can tolerate the arrogance of those who need to check everybody's passpost or ID when entering the country at Manchester Airport - which I find extremely annoying, but still, it's not the employees' choice. What I cannot tolerate is the horrible experience during departures - particularly the security checks. My sister's hand luggage was rejected, along with at least 50 other bags. Around 1 out of 2 bags gets rejected and, OK, a lot of travellers don't pay attention to liquids at all, but most of the bags were totally fine except for items which are normally accepted in every other airport. The most frustrating thing is waiting for your rejected luggage to be examined. The staff cannot respect the order at all, so you end up waiting for half an hour while people who were behind you in the queue manage to get through. In the end my sister's bag contained a scented candle, which apparently cannot be carried into the suitcase. Nobody showed a bit of respect for us or more unlucky people who were only 10 minutes away from missing their flight. Absolutely terrible experience, I would avoid this airport altogether if Leeds was better linked to Italy.",1.0
835,"Manchester airport is generally a decent airport. I've never been overly delayed whilst boarding a flight and there's always stuff to do to keep you occupied, however terminal 3 is basically a cattle market, even on a Thursday morning in November it was just chaotic. People everywhere, drunk, immense amounts of stag do's and hen do's - yuck. Also when arriving back to Manchester airport you have to pass UK border control as you do in every country. This is the worst passport control I have seen in any airport. It's not just once it's been the worst experience. I waited over an hour last night to get through the queue. There must have been over 1000 people queuing to get through and they were using just 5 e-passport machines, foreign people couldn't understand the electronic system a lot of the time and one women was flapping around for ages with her passport in the machine with no success. I've flown back to Manchester airport at least 6 times this year and every time has been the same! Horrific passport control with hardly any staff. Every other airport you walk straight through. Manchester seriously needs to sort this out.",3.0
836,"T1 - dirty, cluttered, confusing and generally abysmal, as usual. I booked wheelchair assistance with the airline for one of our group as they have heart problems and can't walk very far. Arrived at check in desk and enquired about the pre-booked wheelchair (airline advised on the phone that the wheelchair would be available at the check in desk), to be told we had to walk all the way down to the other end of check in area to the assistance office and ask in there. Went to assistance office to be met by rude, surly, couldn't care less staff who pointed to a wheelchair and told us to push it ourselves. So no 'assistance' then. Service was equally bad on our return, with several passengers requiring wheelchairs but not enough staff provided to push them, so family/friends were left to do it instead. I can't imagine what impression visitors to the UK must get after landing at Manchester, it's an over-priced and disorganised dump. It's time they invested some money in the place and sorted themselves out - they could afford it from all the £1 coins they collect for using the luggage trolleys. The only highlight of the experience was the Aspire lounge which we used on departure, where it was clean and comfortable with decent food.",1.0
837,"The security check in was a shambles, with little passage of information my wife spend 10 minutes waiting to reclaim her bag as it sat on the belt after being scanned. Staff not clear telling people what to do when second scan done on bag. On arrival back into the UK at passport control or should I say lack of control. Massive queue at the micro chip passport control while 6 lanes not in use. One border control staff sat playing with her hair looking bored while 200 people go through 1 gate. Then the machine to check passports did not work for half the people it checked. So you get sent to a human, who had a face like a wet weekend not friendly or welcoming. Meanwhile foreign nationals sail through passport control. Bad staff not friendly a shambles. Customs stood like a bunch of thugs leaning against walls in a group of 15 plus. I will never fly from Manchester airport again On a plus note the car park company were very good and professional I recommend APH.",2.0
838,"A miserable experience. I travelled to New Zealand, Australia and Singapore. Manchester was the only one that was filthy. It is just such a dreadful airport to travel through. It feels worn out and dirty, the queue to get through passport control took half an hour for 4 automatic passport readers (the 5th one was out of order) to process the queue. They charge for everything. It was by far the worst airport I have visited and makes me embarrassed to be British. A terrible first sight of the UK for tourists.",1.0
839,"I have never experienced such rude staff in an airport and I've been in quite a few in my time. I was changing to a connecting flight from Paris (which had been delayed) on to another to go to Edinburgh. Going through security was a nightmare. The staff were rude and searching bags after they went through the scanner literally for the sake of it. I had a friend with me who had all her toiletries and liquids in a clear plastic bag as told. The woman said it was the wrong one (fair enough - but she said it so rudely) and then continued to go through her things saying that lipstick was a liquid. I've never heard such rubbish in my life (all 4 of mine got through without being questioned). When I confronted her she said it had been that way for 10 years at Manchester airport. Now I understand if the staff are stressed with their lack of staff but there's really no need to speak to people the way they did, everything was an inconvenience for them yet they were the ones choosing to make it harder for themselves. really disappointed - not even Paris is like that considering everything going on right now.",2.0
840,"I am disgusted with Manchester Airport. I travel a lot and have never had to deal with staff that are so rude and discourteous. Firstly, check in-beyond ridiculous. No humans to do this for you just a free for all, no order and had to tag the bags and drop them off myself. Secondly, the rude, inconsiderate  security - they really should be taught that if you inconvenience people and empty and maul their personal possessions they should at least have the decency to put them back in the bag they came from. When bringing this to a member of managements attention, I was just given a puzzled look and asked if I thought they had time? More so than myself, who had purchased queue jump for security and still had to wait. Upon our return, we had to wait for over an hour to get through passport control as there were only 2 members off staff on the EU passport line, while the international passport queue was empty yet fully staffed. There was then a further 40 minute wait for our bags. Poor and to be avoided if at all possible.",1.0

When it was our turn we were made to empty all our bags and these were also swabbed. Asked why all the bags were being checked and told this was a random check. I am all for security but this was over the top it seemed every person was having there bags checked hence the 15 minute wait. Toilets are reasonably clean but the drains did smell. Waiting area, consists of very uncomfortable seats which have seen better days, there are lots with tares, and are very stained. Overall not a pleasant experience to the start of the holiday.",3.0
842,"Manchester airport never ceases to amaze me with its disorganisation. The layout, the staff and facilities are in such disarray, the staff seem to spend more time talking to each other about their nights out than actually doing what they are paid for. Security is a joke, whilst I fully accept the need for it there seems to be total chaos at unlike any other airport with queues and bags being carted from one belt to another by staff when rejected and people are lost picking up bag. The only place they have spent money is the duty free shops so it's a shame that for most flights you can't really buy anything, unless you want to get ripped off buying something like a newspaper where the shop and not the customer claim back the tax. I dread coming here and it's the only negative of moving to Lancashire, I use liverpool given the chance and even Heathrow for holidays but Heathrow is a 4 hour drive for me.",1.0

All the staff at the two Middle East airports were smartly presented and courteous when asked a question. On arriving back at Manchester you are met my a dark depressing environment with staff with suits that look three sizes too big for them and ties that they do not know how to tie correctly and not even straight. Dubai and Doha leave Manchester standing as they have bright and airy terminals that are spotlessly clean and are so quiet and relaxing compared to Manchester. Yes they have invested heavily in these two airports but they also take pride in their environment. It almost like you are arriving in a communist county at Manchester when you compare it to the two airports mentioned.

Immense queues to get through passport control, slow electronic checking with lots of disgruntled passengers. Baggage collection was quite efficient on this occasion - but that has not always been my experience at MAN. We emerged outside for our pickup well over an hour after landing. Outside, in the immediate vicinity of the pickup and drop off point, the picture was absolutely ridiculous. There are only eight possible parking places for cars and taxis. Road signage is poor. People are employed to bellow at lingering motorists in a vain attempt to keep the traffic flowing. All traffic - including large buses - uses the same single lane of road to service thousands of passengers. It does not work and it seems obvious that at some point a pedestrian will be seriously injured. So we waited outside for a further 30 minutes for our lift - as the traffic built up so far back. Overall a shabby and inefficient experience which I will try to avoid during future travel.",4.0

Took around 40 minutes in total, including 10 minutes finding it - signage not clear. If I hadn't bought Fast Track through security we would have missed our flights as the queues were so huge. The scanner staff were appallingly rude - wait until you're told to pick up a tray - you can't do that - take that off - just whom do they think they are? Can't really review any more of the airport as we didn't get to see it, the flight was boarding by the time we had cleared security. This was despite arriving at the airport almost two hours before the flight and paying for Meet and Greet, Fast Track through security, having already checked in online, and only taking hand luggage.

849,We arrived in Manchester at 1.30am to what at first appeared to be a ghost town. Imagine our surprise as we approached passport control to find a queue of several hundred yards long. It was an utter joke and took over an hour and a quarter to get to the control area were there were just two operatives checking passports and a third directing people through the new automatic (robot?) checking booths. The automatic booths seemed to be failing to recognise around 75% of users and were just generally holding the whole queue up. This kind of unnecessary delay is exactly what one does not need after a long day and a long flight.,2.0
850,Have recently traveled via airports in Africa and the Middle East which were far superior in every respect to this appalling airport. Agree with all the adverse comments that are made about Manchester airport. Do the people in charge ever read these comments? Security staff are arrogant and rude and treated me with total disrespect. Toilet facilities are hopelessly inadequate and the whole airport needs urgent attention. Avoid at all costs.,1.0
851,Have been using Manchester airport for over 20 years and I have to say it is getting progessively worse as the years go on. Most people these days check in online so only have to drop off the bags but the queues are so bad. Often waiting over 30 minutes. However once you've dropped off your bags worse is yet to come at security. There are usually hundreds of people and not enough airport staff to deal with them and the queues seem to go on forever. We all appreciate that in this day and age security is paramount but why not open all the desks when you are busy. We arrived at the airport over 2 hours before our flight was due to go out but because of all the queues we ending up getting to our gate just as it was closing. We had no time for a drink something to eat or a look around duty free. The airport must be losing a fortune on lost revenue due to all the time it takes to get through check in and security. Coming back into the country isn't much better with huge queues trying to get through passport control and even if you have an up to date passport the alternative queues to scan your passport yourself are just as busy and don't always work. Manchester Airport really do need to look at staffing levels and stop trying to cut corners.,2.0
852,First time I have been to terminal 2 at Manchester airport - what a joke. Thomson queues for check-in were bad enough 1.5 hours to get through - only 3 desks open out of 10 plus. Worse was to come - at security there must have been nearly 1000 people trying to get through. Out of 10 lanes only 2 were open - it was an absolute joke. Worse I have ever seen at any airport - it needs improving or they should move flights to other airports.,2.0

Then major delays with the baggage delivery and the children's buggies having to wait until last - 1 hour 30 mins after landing.

856,"At Manchester to catch a flight to Skiathos nearly 3 hours the flight. Met with a queue at the car meet and greet, 30 minutes wait, luckily had priority boarding and security. Check-in went fine, then onto security, again despite having fast track another long wait, not enough staff and the ones they have in no hurry. We had booked a Lounge there was no time to use it by this stage, that's the second time out of the last three visits this has happened and it's a waste of time and money. Talking to others on the plane we are not alone. The shops airside must be losing a fortune due to lack of time to shop and eat as everybody rushes through. For arrival, surprised to find they had extra machines in passport control, and they worked rather well and a definite improvement on previous visits but we were the only plane in at the time. For baggage delivery, again, a surprise, nearly right away was one of our suitcases. Then nothing. Surely as the only flight it wouldn't be long but nothing else came for 45 minutes. Nobody to get any info from or complain to. This was a bit better than our last visit which was an hour and a half wait. Manchester has gone from being a very good and professional place to a shambles. I have used various airports in Spain, Greece, Portugal the last few years and all including Liverpool are miles better as a passenger experience. Only using Manchester as a last resort from now on, next year it's Liverpool for me. I don't care if it's even more expensive, I can't put up with the stress and unprofessional performance on offer these days, park and greet, priority check-in, security, lounge, it still didn't mean I got a good beginning and end to a holiday.",2.0
857,"What an awful airport. It is ill-equipped to deal with the volume of passengers from start to finish. I have never before had to queue on a car parking bus just to get dropped off at departures, the drop off zone is small and narrow which resulted in a queue back to the roundabout. The entrance to the airport is dark, depressing and claustrophobic. Security was very slow with long queues - this is the fourth time I have had to fly from Manchester and on all four occasions security was slow with long queues. My bag was pulled and inspected (fine, not a problem) and when I asked the reason I was advised 'we have newly trained staff who are pulling everything and anything which is slowing things down. An experienced member of staff wouldn't pull half of these'. The departures lounge (T3) is small with limited facilities. It was very overcrowded. On our return to Manchester we were greeted off the plane and in to the airport by a really happy and friendly member of staff - he was the only highlight! We then went through passport control where some of the staff were extremely rude. My passport could not be read by the biometric reader so I was separated from my partner and guided to a desk. My partner waited for me and was literally barked at by the Scottish lady 'you can't wait here, if you wanted to come through together you should have stayed together'. Her whole manner was aggressive and unfriendly. A simple 'I'm afraid you can't wait here. Please go through the doors' in a friendly tone would have sufficed. I do anything I can to avoid flying from Manchester airport and think it is a poor first impression for visitors to the area. Someone please sort it.",1.0

This time the officer who did the search was polite, unlike last year where the officer was rude, aggressive and abrub and just snarled orders. When through the security you are then subjected to an IKEA type walk through the shops who have goods on display stacked on the walkway. One was tempted to ""bump"" a large stack of goods to make the whole lot tumble over. It was resisted but I really hate being forced to go through a shop rather than just past it. Next we arrived at the gate only to find there was hardly any seating or even a place to wait. The whole flight was forced to stand in the corridor and obstruct other passengers who were trying to walk to their gate further down the walkway.

864,"We departed Manchester Airport Terminal 2 on the 21 August 2016 for our annual holiday and would describe ourselves as infrequent flyers. Prior to arriving at the hand luggage security check there are no signs indicating if travel documentation is required to be produced or not, so numerous travelers including ourselves arrived with boarding cards and passports in our hands, only to be to be then told (as if we should have known better) that we should have nothing in our hands and quickly place our hand luggage into the trays provided with no clear instruction as to where we should place our documentation, ie in our pockets if we had them or into our hand baggage. The female operative and her superiors issuing these instructions clearly did not realize that if she had been positioned 10 meters before the security check area and visual displays had been in-place with clear instructions the process would have been far smoother than the organized confusion which we walked into. Hand luggage which was then identified as requiring a visual search took a long time to be reunited with its owner due to the small area that the operatives were working in and the small number of operatives on duty, who were by the way very polite and patient. We returned on the 1 September 2016 to Terminal 2 on a mid-day flight to then queue for 45 mins at passport control, only to discover that there were only 5 passport scanning machines, and that once you actually got to the machine 1 in 8 passengers were unable to be scanned which was very time consuming for all involved. Families with children under 18 were sent direct to manual passport inspection prior to joining the queue, however there were a large number of passengers in the queue who were 65 yrs plus who clearly did not enjoy the experience of shuffling along in a queue for 45 mins! Having spoken to other passengers in the queue it would appear that a 45 mins wait is a regular occurrence and that having your passport rejected by the scanners is also as frequent.",3.0

Then when we return to Manchester following a 7 hr flight we are made to queue again for well over an hour to get through passport control into the country we live in.

Incredibly, nearly all bags were selected for secondary screening. That process proved excruciatingly slow with passengers becoming increasingly irritated. I had to wait an hour to get my bag back. The departure area is clearly too small to accommodate the volume of travellers, with too many shops and not enough waiting areas - people were even sitting on the floor and stairs.

870,Awful airport. Security takes forever they pretty much check every bag. Mine was checked after x-ray as they thought I'd left a liquid in it. I hadn't. It took about an hour to get through security. Then to walk to the gates you've to wait while other flights are disembarking as the corridor is too narrow or something. Toilets were dirty and not pleasant. No seats at gates really. Have travelled extensively and this is definitely the worst airport I've been at.,1.0

872,"MAN is a convenient hub for travel to the northern part of the UK and has direct flights from a number of US hubs on the eastern seaboard. Independent of LHR's BAA affiliation it has a large number of carriers from its 3 terminals. Though convenient to access [road congestion low, rental car facilities near and parking sufficient] I typically encounter the worst check in delays of any major airport I use. The check in area is cramped and woefully under staffed on most airlines, so expect 1h+ wait for any long haul check in. Security lines are equally slow, with 45 min-1 h common. Accordingly, unless airline allows online check in, you are wise to hold a 3h buffer for arrival at airport for an on time departure. Facilities are adequate, but given delays in check in /security the chances are you will be heading straight to the gate anyway.",6.0
873,"My flight from Stockholm went smoothly until I arrived at Manchester Airport. The first problem was that there were no stairs available to get off the aircraft and we had an uncomfortable 15-20 wait. Secondly, there were two sets of stairs with no lift or escalators to get into the terminal building. Once in the terminal I had to negotiate a number of escalators and travelators that were not working (could they all have been broken or were they switched off). It's some way to the station and non-functioning escalators etc doesn't help.

One of the questions was 'Where are you staying in the UK?' and the next question was 'How long are you staying in the UK?'. As I was not staying in the UK, I didn't fill that out. The woman at the desk told me to enter where I would be staying in Ireland and for how long. I was tired, frustrated and worried I would miss my connection and I cursed to myself as I walked away. This offended the woman at the desk. When I got back in line, she verbally, and loudly, chastised me and appeared to be waiting for me to react (I did not). She then made me get out of line to help the next people in line. She then demanded that I sit down and when I said I had been sitting on a plane for 9 hours and would like to remain standing, she demanded again that I sit down. She made me wait until the line was cleared and when I stepped up to the desk, she took my passport and papers then turned away to do other tasks while I stood at her desk. Then she proceeded to have a casual conversation with a coworker. When she finally cleared me to leave, she told me in a very nasty tone, ""Next time keep your comments to yourself!""

They searched the bag, telling us it was our own fault they were being searched because we had liquids (most of us didn't). We were waiting over half an hour just for this to occur. Then they re-xrayed the bags, returning them to the long queue we'd waited in the first time. Those of us with 2 pieces of hand baggage had our bags put on 2 separate trolleys and had to wait for 2 different staff to search them. There were 100's of people stood around while this happened.

All was very straightforward and the staff delivered a very professional and courteous service on the outward leg. However, on my return 2 weeks later, they were nowhere to be seen. I disembarked from the aircraft at around 8.30am on a Wednesday morning and looked around for someone to help but no one. No wheelchairs to be seen, no airport staff, nothing. Thankfully, I can walk a bit, but slowly, and finally made it to the passport lines where a 'marshall' saw my predicament and told me to go over to the fast track line. Thankfully, that queue was much shorter and I was through in about 5 minutes. So, a bit of a mixed bag from Manchester Airport this time. They illustrated on the outward leg that they can do things right for those not so able so I'll put it down to just an oversight. Maybe they were busy elsewhere as our flight arrived early?",4.0
881,The whole experience was dreadful. Firstly there was one check in agent on our Monarch flight for non priority. However it was security when things became abysmal. It was July and one of the peak months but took over an hour to get through. To make matters worse they tried to blame passengers for having non allowed items. The explanation was rubbish as it was the fact that they had 2 units only open for mainstream passengers with 2 lanes on each with lanes 1-6 all shut and unmanned. Talking to staff on the side they admitted understaffing was an on going problem. We had to go straight from security to our gate. If I was one of the retail outlets paying high rents I would be objecting to passengers being denied time to visit due to their understaffing. Compare and contrast with Alicante which was very busy on our return. They had about 8 rows with 2 lines each and we were processed efficiently in under 10 minutes.

All the Manchester Staff could say was ""use the telephone number on the machines - it has nothing to do with the airport"".

The eating facilities are on the ground floor and the departures mostly on floor 5 so there is very often a long queue to get the lift up to that floor with many people trying to get out of the lift and crossing the queue waiting. Generally there doesn't seem to be any planning with regard to anything and people are left to their own devices in where to go and how to queue properly, which, as most psychologists will tell you, is a 100% way in which to infuriate people.

Luckily one of the very friendly ladies at Security allowed me to get back to the general hall so I could find my way to Check-in (which was quite swift as it was very quiet). Went through Security, and ended up in the departure lounge which was absolutely packed with people. It's definitely too small to deal with the number of lights in the summer. People, noise, litter everywhere, quite hot, no place to sit, bars and restaurant packed so it was hard to grab a bite before getting on the plane.

Such greed and being taken for mugs extremely annoying. Shame on you Manchester Airport.",4.0
915,"I haven't flown out of Manchester airport in years and I can honestly say it is the worst airport I have ever flown out of. Their security is ridiculous even with priority boarding it took an hour and a half. At security you have to remove electric toothbrush, hair straighteners, mobile phone cables and if your bag is rejected you have to wait upto an hour. And they can check your bag put it thru security and it gets pulled again for no reason and you have to wait another again. Avoid Manchester Terminal 3. I have never seen regular travellers so fearful that their bag will get pulled in security as they know if this happens they will miss their flight.",1.0
916,Manchester is the worst airport I have ever arrived at in all my years of travelling around the world. After hours of travelling we are faced by this new passport face scanning system which takes twice as long as the manual checks. After 50 minutes getting through the passport control you guessed it - no bags. When they did arrive after a further 20 minutes - the handlers had left the bags on the trolley outside in the pouring rain and wet had gone into the bags. You must now allow a minimum of 1h15m from touch down to getting to the car at Manchester and expect your pick up driver to pay £9 car park charges for the privilege. If I could get to another airport at reasonable costs I would never fly from Manchester again.,2.0
917,"It takes a great deal for me to actually put the effort in to complain about something. In this day and age I have become resigned to inferior service, poor quality of goods and poor support. However Manchester airport terminal 1 was so terrible. I would mention that I am a frequent flyer. In the past 12 months I have flown to Chicago, Madrid, Frankfurt, Heathrow, Gatwick, Prague and more, not one of them caused the consternation or rage that Manchester did. I arrived at the airport 1h20m prior to my flight. Having already checked in online with no hold bags. After queuing for 45m+ I managed to attract the attention of a very officious young lady who grudgingly allowed me to jump to the front of the queue. Once I made my way to the bag check area I was met by, a very pleasant young lady who was helpful and friendly (I would suggest that every other person working on security at terminal one should take lessons on how to deal with people). After 10 minutes or so of waiting I saw my bag move slowly (almost reluctantly) through the system, unsurprisingly it was then pulled out for a bag check. At this point my gate was due to close shortly. I politely asked one member of staff to check my bag as I feared I would miss my flight. I was met with annoyance and waved away. I persisted and was met with the same look of annoyance and told that I would be dealt with as soon as possible. During this I noticed two members of the security staff stood behind the same desk chatting about their plans for Sunday. The lady I had spoken to then walked off without advising anyone of my situation. I asked one gentlemen (whom seemed to be more concerned with watching other members of staff work) if it would be possible to check my bag as I did not want to miss my flight. He waved his hands in front of my face and walked off. At this point I lost my temper and firmly asked him again whether it would be possible to have my bag checked. He assured me someone would be with me soon. 10m later a very obnoxious lady pulled my bags apart and found a cigarette lighter. I apologised for this realising that it was my error and asked if I could take my bag. She insisted it go through security again (despite me saying I was quite happy for her to throw the lighter as I was in a rush.) I was then admonished for not removing the lighter (implying I was wasting her time.) The bag was then taken back to the machines. Despite my protestations about the time involved the bag was placed at back of the queue and I had to wait nearly 15m for the bag to return. Once there I grabbed my bag ran through the awful duty free maze and got to gate ten minutes after it was due to be closed. Thankfully my flight was delayed. I have family in Manchester so I will have to use this travesty of an airport again. The service was appalling, the staff rude and the general atmosphere showed a complete lack of care or empathy for those forced to use this joke of an establishment. I am looking at alternate routes for future travel.",1.0
918,"Awful, worst airport I've used. Massive queues for security going out (1 hour 10 mins) and passport control on return (1 hour 20 minutes). Departures is a huge shopping mall with more and more shops being added all the time. Horrible, avoid this airport.",1.0
919,"The security check system in Manchester Airport is indeed hellish - queued for a very long time, then had my bag held back after it had been x-rayed (one of a very large number and far more than I have ever witnessed in any other airport). There did not appear to be any system for examining bags so I joined a scrum to wait for mine to be selected (seemingly at random). I was then asked to remove my hair straighteners, whereupon the bag was re x-rayed and apparently that was all that was required. The staff were extremely brusque, but were also clearly overstretched. While we all appreciate the need for security, if such standards are to be maintained, staff and resources must expand accordingly. On the other side of security there was no improvement. There is insufficient seating, not enough bars or cafes, overall a truly dire experience. Why not re-open Blackpool airport to try to meet the demand?",1.0
920,"The security at this airport has gone downhill very fast. On our way out of the country, we arrived at terminal 1 at the airport 2 hours and 40 minutes before our departure. We checked in quickly and joined the back of the long security queue 2 hours 20 mins before take off time. While waiting in the queue we read several signs that stated our ipad minis did not have to be taken out of our bags. After an hour and 15 minutes we arrived at the scanners, we left our ipad mini in our bag and then our bag was pulled aside, along with several other traveller's bags. We then had to wait behind these travellers for another 25 minutes until it was time for our bag to be manually checked. The problem? Our ipad mini. When I pointed out the signs that I had read, I was told ""That is just general advice by the government, Manchester airport's rules require ipad mini's to be taken out"". I suggested that they put another notice to that effect or that we be told before putting cases through, as this would help. I was told quite rudely ""You should know our ipad rules, as it hasn't changed in years"". By the time we left security they were putting a final call out for our flight, and calling our names by the time we got to the gate. On our return, we landed at 15.15 hrs. We got to the back of the security queue at 15.40 hrs. The queue was due to the new automatic security checks. We were in the queue for 35 minutes, before being told families with children under 12 need to have manual checks, so we had to join another queue. By 16.35 hrs we got through security, only to find that because of travellers without kids were still delayed, the luggage carousel was full of cases that weren't being collected. Only 1 of our cases was there, and because the carousel was full we had to wait. We eventually got out of the airport at 17:45 hrs. To add to all the delays, the traffic on the M56 was terrible. it took us another 2 hours to drive home (which would normally take 30 minutes).",2.0
921,"Using this airport has become a tedious, miserable experience. In particular, the bag security check area now resembles the seventh circle of hell, with many unhappy customers circling while curt and unfriendly staff chide them rudely for minor packing misdemeanours. Among the items we've been stopped for are face wipes and hair straighteners (deemed acceptable by some inspections, not by others). On our most recent trip, last weekend, we were in there for an hour. In what way do they regard this as acceptable? The state of repair of the airport is extremely poor. We were held on board a flight arriving from Rome as the jet bridge did not work. This took 45 minutes to resolve, while we all stood waiting. When we did disembark there was a huge queue for the E-gates which worked poorly. Even the automatic exit doors from the customs area weren't working. Finally, why do they force all passengers to walk through the shopping area en-route to the gates? Does everything in this country have to be run by marketing people?",1.0
922,"Unfortunately I have the displeasure of travelling in and out of Manchester on a weekly basis. T3 is probably the best experience. This does not mean it is good, it's just marginally better than the appalling experience of T1 and T2. For me T2 is the pinnacle of of everything wrong with how to run an airport. I have particular non affection for the security staff. Customers are constantly reminded that staff will not tolerate any kind of aggression, which is basically is a blue print for poor quality and a terrible service. The experience of arriving at MAN is actually worse. 3 out of the 5 chip readers were not working. It took me longer to get through passport control than it did to fly in from Palma by which time my local taxi company had given up and gone home - we had to take a black cab approx 3 times the cost. I regularly fly through Amsterdam Schiphol which is a slick operation. Minimal queuing. Staff who actually know how to smile and reasonable value in bars etc. MAN on the other hand is a shambles and expensive.",1.0
923,What a shambles. On arriving at Passport control the queue was the worst I'd ever seen there. If you were entering from an EEC country you had to use the biometric passport reader. You were not allowed to go to a human being as we were told by using machines it kept costs down. You go straight to a border guard if you were from outside the EEC and you were through in no time. Forty five minutes to get through. Ridiculous.,2.0
924,"I use this airport several times a year and have travelled through all three terminals. Very easy to get to either by road or using either the train or tram. The terminals are fairly far apart as is the train station. Make sure you know which terminal you are travelling from to save a lot of backtracking and wasted time. Check in areas are large, how well or quick it works depends on individual airlines. Because it is a major airport with most airlines having several flights, I would advise arriving extra early just in case your check-in is busy. Security can have long waits in peak season, even if every scanner is open, people still take time getting through. The airport sells a queue jump ticket for the security. It can only be bought in advance and costs £4. To me it's a no brainer, if security is busy you have just avoided a long wait and all the stress so you get to relax in departures sooner. If security is quiet then you are only out £4 which compared to the cost of most flights is nothing. After security, it is just like every other large airport. The same stores and a few eateries. Food and Drinks are overpriced compared to the real world but about normal compared to other UK airports. Often the eateries have money off vouchers available on the airport website so it's worth a check out. The gates could be 2 minutes walk from the shops or 20 minutes so don't leave it to the last minute before going to the gate. On arrival you will almost certainly have a long walk down dull corridors to reach security often without travelators, so if you have issues walking be aware. Security in arrivals always gets me through before my luggage arrives despite the queues. Overall the airport is always clean, the only real downsides is that the air con leaves the air really dry and that if you are on a late flight many of the shops will shut before you board.",10.0
925,It seems we are now being forced down the e-passport lane on arrival. This despite fewer people queuing at the traditional desks.

Wi-fi slow and restricted by time - a mile behind other European airports.,2.0
926,"As a regular user of Manchester airport, I can safely say that their usual standards are slipping horrendously. Flew on a day return to Dublin with Ryanair - security staff were quite snappy to say the least but nowhere near as bad as the staff at Swissport. Outbound flight delayed by half an hour at least (I knew this due to looking at FlightRadar24) when I asked them about this I was told that the flight was on time. Boarding commenced (or in other words, got in the queues) before the aircraft (kudos to Ryanair, a week old 737-800) had actually left Dublin. When I showed them the FR24 data I was told ""well, we thought it was on time"". Flight arrived into Dublin 25 mins late. The flight back arrived early (despite leaving Dublin 30 mins late), however missed 2 trains due to the inconvenience of the airport and Swissport who bussed us 200 yards which took a grand total of 20 minutes. Disgraceful. I will use the airport due to convenience - however Leeds Bradford will be my first port of call from now.",4.0

None of the staff would give any explanation. Fellow travellers were speculating that there were only 1 or 2 control officers on site or e-visa IT problems again. The staff refused to give any explanation. When we got within sight of the control desks we saw over a dozen armed police in attendance, so it was obviously a security alert. People would have been far more patient if more information had been available. Someone did say that a number of planes had landed close together, and one of these, from Antalya, had been delayed. As it takes over 4 hours to fly from Antalya this should have been plenty of time for a contingency plan to be implemented.",2.0
928,"Manchester Airport is truly dystopian. Worst experience in an airport to date. Security was disorganized, slow, rechecked bags, and uses a standard for carry on items different from most other airports. Don't fly through. The queue itself was long without any ability to judge wait time.",1.0
929,"Most of the time I fly from Manchester with Lufthansa and the check-in process is straightforward. Then through to security - here staff seem to be self appointed judges of other people's time as they seem to make up the rules as they go along. Judging by their attitude and behaviour, not even the most basic form of human interaction is in place, a simple please or thank you for example. Now the security ordeal is completed one has to manage an enforced hurdle run through a duty free area with no clear signage how to get out of there. Gates are only announced just before departure resulting in constant last calls for passengers and threats of gate closure. One has to hang around and look from where the flight is to leave, with no option to maybe spend time in one of the substandard ""catering outlets"" or to sit down somewhere. If one thought departure is a nightmare, wait for your arrival - passengers are guided through a maze of narrow corridors with steps going up and down for no obvious reason, with no help or assistance to older passengers or families with children. At passport control the E-machines are most of the time not working - if they are don't bother with them because they are slow and after passing they want to see the passport anyway. The staffed desks for passport control seem to have taken part in the same ""customer service"" training as security staff. As if this is not enough, after having spend up to an hour waiting to get through to baggage belts, here one has to wait an other 45 minutes to get the luggage, so in short - it often takes longer to get through this airport as the time it took to travel to this place. The management should go to places like Zurich, Munich or any other airport in the world to see how an ""International"" airport is organised and run.",1.0

In fact I would go as far as saying if you make any comment you just get your bag stopped for a second time - they seem to think that is a fun thing to do. And the car park booking - don't even bother trying to phone to amend a booking. The phone seems to be permanently busy during working hours of 9 until 6 - but then they don't seem to work all those hours anyway and you get the answerphone saying that the office is closed just 6 pm - even if the time is only 5.30 pm. You could try the customer contact centre if you can afford the 1 hour await to get through to an operator who then puts you through to an non existent number that just rings out for hours.

There was total chaos in the whole security area. Once you are in the departure 'lounge' it is completely packed with people, there is very little seating so most people are standing. It feels more like being on a packed commuter train than in an airport. This airport is a total disgrace and an utter embarrassment to the UK. Would I fly from Manchester again? Absolutely not.",1.0

One reason was 'too many cables', the second was 'unbagged liquid' - a 5ml bottle of ear drops. No problem with these items in Dubai or when coming from Australia.

I think we all know that by now, remove your liquids and your bag is removed for a further search, rude security staff happy to chat to each other with no sense of urgency.

Then when the machines did not work, as they didn't for many, they were quite aggressively ordered to get out of the queue and join the other long queue for the normal desks. The lady did not even give people another chance to try the machine, stating 'people are waiting'.

Travellers suffered with over-tired children who were hot and very bothered with nowhere to sit, stuffy hot conditions in a crowded space under a low ceiling. When we finally arrived at the scanning lanes (16 of them but only 4 operating) some staff were sitting at empty lanes simply staring at monitors while we stewed in the heat. Whilst passengers were becoming more irate after 1.5 hours in the queue, the ultimate horror was a staff member instructing us to be patient - What an insult.

It eventually came out on carousel 2 but never showed our flight details. This is not the first time we have had trouble with cases coming out late. We travel about twice a year and Manchester has got to be the worst airport for baggage handling. Every time we arrive in Manchester we always have to wait ages for our baggage to come through.

Then when you put your passport into the machine it doesn't register and gives no feedback so you stand there again wondering what is wrong. The staff then say ""turn your passport around, photo in first"" which then works so you are now staring at a screen with 5 circles that fill up like a progress meter only they repeat this cycle about 10 times so you are again wonder if anything is really happening.

953,"On two of our last three visits, we have found Manchester Airport a stressful and unpleasant experience. On the latest occasion, even though we checked our bags in at the required two hours before our flight, the Airport seemed utterly overwhelmed by the volume of passengers it needed to screen through security. Given that the numbers were obviously predictable, this was inexplicable. We stood for an hour in a long snaking line, with officials raising the tension still further by informing already stressed passengers that people making mistakes with electronics/liquids etc would ""have to wait an hour to get their bags checked"" and ""people are missing their flights."" By the time we got through, we were exhausted, anxious and ran to our gate. We were supposed to be starting our much-needed and hard-earned holiday. Staff at Manchester seem to be nearly uniformly unfriendly and unhelpful, with no concept that passengers are paying customers. It left us wondering about the leadership culture which produces this approach; moreover, the management of predictable flows of passengers seems wholly inadequate. If we have a viable alternative choice in future we will avoid Manchester.",1.0

Every 6 months they put the price of car parking up by about 20 pence, that might not seem a lot but think about how many millions of people use this on a daily basis.

955,"Security in T3 is dreadful. Woefully understaffed in a cramped undersized area. Fast track means nothing (unlike other airports where it is separate) - don't waste your money. Spent 45 mins waiting for my bag (random check) observing the staff - one good efficient member of staff, two painfully slow (and don't mean with the search part - you can't rush that, it's too important) and one extremely rude to many customers. I shall try not to fly from Manchester T3 from at all possible in the future. Shameful treatment of customers.",1.0
956,The automated passport machines at Manchester are useless. I arrived from Iceland where everything just works - the technology at Keflavik is brilliant so it's a total embarrassment arriving back home to useless technology. The airport is scruffy and I'll try to avoid it in future.,3.0
957,"Totally shambolic and inadequate facility. Terminal 3 departure lounge is full of staircases to negotiate and far too small for the crowds. Baggage desk area becomes log-jammed if three people walk abreast. Parking is shockingly expensive. On departure, you're made to queue in the stairwells to the apron while passangers alight your plane. On arrival, you're immediately met by stairwells to negotiate, often more than one flight, once you enter the terminal building. Passport control is understaffed, with biometric scanners so dysfunctional, they require as many border security staff as the standard control desks. Staff speak to users as though it's their fault they don't work. Staff then start shepherding the growing queues and bark at people. Staff on passport control are rude and frown a lot. The whole Manchester Airport City £800 million investment completely misses the point and ignores the fact that the terminal three building is an utter failure and unfit for use.",1.0
958,"In common with so many other passengers we had a poor experience with the e-passport machines at Manchester Airport. I know how to use these machines (which way to insert the passport, where to stand even though this means I can't see the instructions on the screen when I remove my glasses like you're required to do etc) and despite this I had to try twice and then have my passport checked by a border force officer after waiting in another queue. Why do the machines at Schiphol work so well and why are the ones at Manchester so ineffective?",6.0

960,"Having travelled from Manchester Airport in February and April of 2016, I really do not wish to do it again. I understand the need for the increased security, but on both occasions of my return, the scene at the passport scanning machines was chaotic. With (by my calculation) around 10% having a 'refusal' by the machine, and having to join another queue for manual checking. The staff at these machines are unhelpful to say the least, and shout at people unashamedly. They should be told that such arrogance will only antagonise passengers more than the machine is doing. It is obvious that these machines are not fit for their intended purpose, and the sooner they are scrapped the better. Also, prior to departure from this airport in February, on collecting the tray containing my belongings after the security scan, I noticed my coat was covered in a grey dust like material which contained what appeared to be cobwebs. After trying to remove the dust, I went to join my wife who was, as usual, having her myriad packets of tablets tested with the 'probe'. It was then that I noticed that a small phial of electronic cigarette liquid which I had originally placed in my tray, had at some stage been removed and placed in my wifes tray and was also being probed. I did not transfer it, and neither did my wife. Maybe I have watched too many Border Control programmes on TV, but firstly, if my jacket picked up so much dust from a tray, then it is obvious that cross contamination is not just possible, but highly likely. And secondly, if staff are moving items from one tray to another without the owners consent, then it puts them in a very serious position indeed.",2.0
961,"An organisation in meltdown. Had the misfortune to depart from this airport with my family. A disaster from the start, 50 minutes to queue at the bag drop. Security awful, directed to the overflow T1 lanes as an hour wait at the normal lines, boarding pass reader did not work and the staff member could not be bothered to help - just rude. My bag was screened 4 times and pulled apart, seemingly an asthma inhaler is a novel item here. All the staff were rude, my son was shouted at for having a ""bum bag"", it was an orthopaedic sling for a dislocated shoulder. Out of the dozen or so airports I've used in the last quarter, this is the worst by a mile. Rude staff and chaotic organisation are the consequence of a business who think they have a captive customer base. Manchester should take a look at Munich, Zurich, Dusseldorf, all a mile better.",1.0

Queues for security moved swiftly, despite the best efforts of some travellers who still don't understand the need to be prepared to have their laptops, liquids, coats off and pockets empty.

Like most airports now the airside experience winds you through an array of duty free options before you get to the main departure and seating area. On return bags were slow getting onto the line, however we were through immigration in only five minutes from leaving the plane so some latitude should be afforded baggage handlers here.",9.0
963,"Manchester has to be the worst airport I have had the misfortune to use, and for so many reasons. 1) I am forced to walk through ""Duty Free"" despite being allergic to perfumes. I then spend several hours with my nose streaming and in extreme discomfort. 2) Too many of the airport staff are rude and unhelpful to the point of being churlish. 3) Security inspection - so what do you have to do to avoid having your bags taken to pieces by officious operators on a power trip? We always separate electricals and our fluids and if we carry anything unusual we always ask - and we have never got through Manchester's baggage check without having at least one, and usually both bags literally taken to pieces. 4) Passport and immigration - why have we been having to queue for an unacceptable amount of time just so we can be herded by an irritable immigration ""officer"" into machines which are slow, inaccurate and only work (if at all) after several attempts? The delay was in excess of an hour three weeks ago. 5) Late flights and unacceptable delays - it comes to something when hire car operators in Faro tell you that Manchester flights are always late - and they are not wrong. In over 18 months of traveling regularly (every other week normally) to and from Faro every Manchester flight has been delayed. 6) Vehicular access at Terminal 2, two roads (one in and one from a car park) terminate at the same roundabout and all the traffic is channeled down into one lane to arrivals and departures. The time from the roundabout to the rank is enormous despite being less than 100 yards.",2.0
964,"Security is the worst part of the airport.

No place to wait, no offer of water nothing. No offers of help with luggage even if you have toddler in tow. You stop to carry luggage at the drop off and shepherd your toddler across the traffic lines, do you think you might get any understanding? No of course not instead the staff comes after you threatening to tow your car. We travel through Bangkok and Beijing a lot both are infinitely more welcoming than Manchester.

The guy did not know where he had picked me up from so it meant that when I eventually found my tray it had been left unattended for about 10 minutes. On arrival back everybody on the flight (Tenerife) had to pass through automatic passport control. Lots of failures, lots of apologies and told to complain to Border Control. Luckily we were near the front of the queue but I suspect those near the rear would probably have had to wait over half an hour.",1.0

The reality is customer service is sacrificed in the interests of costs in my view. Very poor, avoid at all costs.",2.0
971,"Manchester Airport is terrible. Especially Terminal 3. Everything is uncoordinated. Check-in lines were a myth. Unless you have checked in online, expect to be lined up with the rest of the flight. Check-in staff were friendly though. We went through Security, fortunately we had pre-paid for Priority. If you hadn't, however, the line was long and not organised whatsoever. It was a rushed process with unhelpful staff. After security, we went along a hallway to the main area. We were greeted by the typical airport shops, Dixons, WHSmith, etc. Manchester Airport food quality is shocking. You can go to Costa, or one of those Cafes that only seem to exist in small Airports. Breakfast choice is typical of sandwiches. It's very greasy and doesn't taste nice. The lines are long and the seating area is dirty and small. After breakfast, we went to the gate area. Not many seats for a large international flight. It was very dirty. It filled up quickly and suddenly became very cramped. Our flight was delayed due to a delayed arrival. The announcements made by the airport staff were bland, unhelpful and hard to hear. When it was time, it was in Boarding Zones. Manchester Airport is not skilled in dealing with Boarding Zones. You had Boarding Zone 4 people stood around during Boarding Zone 1's time. There were no proper lines and it was a slow process. The staff couldn't scan boarding passes very quickly and so it took a while. I do not recommend this airport.",3.0

Then oh joy, the relief to get back home and be faced with one of the wonders of modern science - the automatic passport scanner, which are next to useless and the ensuing scrum of humanity wondering why there are empty manned desks that we are not permitted to use by staff shouting at people to move along.

The return to Manchester and the usual rubbish service, 4 auto passport lanes and 4 screening staff at passport patrol, yet we saw around 500 passengers to be processed. Never enough staff to cope. Luggage hall and no announcement of baggage carousel. Then the luggage about 10 bags per minute arrive, takes 20 minutes.

Not so at Manchester where the lack of customer service and uncaring attitude caused much anxiety and fear of missing the flight. We were left waiting at the OCS desk for almost 1 hour. For most of that time the desk was unmanned - telephone assistance unhelpful and boarderline rude and not an acceptable level of service, particularly in the context of providing assistance to the old, infirm and vulnerable. We arrived in good time and were at the desk at 8.20pm for a flight scheduled to depart at 10.00pm (gate closing at 9.30). The receptionist was polite, but left for a 'short break' not long after we arrived, leaving a 'back in 5 mins' sign and saying her colleague would be along in 10 mins max. We waited patiently but started to get anxious as time passed and nobody came. At 8.45pm we called the contact number on the notice and were told someone was coming shorthly. At 9.00pm still nobody, again we called, again we were fobbed off with, 'he's on the way'. At this point we were getting very concerned that any delays we would be late for boarding or even miss the flight. Also a little unnerving was the fact that the airport was shutting down for the night and we were the only passenger left, check-in was closing, as were all the other desks and concessions around us. It was just us and the cleaners at this point. The experience would have been a lot less stressful if the receptionist had been there to reassure us or if the person who answered the phone had given the impression of caring even just a little. Only after I sought out the airline desk manager and he made a strongly worded call to OCS did they turn up at 9.10. We were delayed at the security check and just about made it to the boarding gate. The employee who did arrive eventually was very polite, helpful and apologetic, he was clearly overworked and I got the impression that he was the only staff member on duty over all 3 terminals. This is not an acceptable level of service.",2.0

We couldn't manage cases and chair at reclaim and he was dealing with a woman who walked on to the plane. She then got out of the chair got her case and pushed it out while we waited for help.

My turn eventually arrived, my 'spot' indicated by a 'surly female', I was confronted at the conveyer belt with the problem of having to feed three trays through the x-ray machine, which with my issues takes a little time. The female staff member was shouting about how I needed to be quicker, as others were waiting and refusing to assist me by perhaps pulling the trays towards the moving belt.

Many passengers found it difficult to operate (especially the elderly). There weren't enough staff to offer guidance and support. Ironically, two passport officers sat with nothing to do as the queue got longer. I saw one frustrated passenger simply give up on the machine and walk around. No one challenged him.

999,Transiting from T3 to T1 having to collect bags and recheck in T1. Easy arrival waiting area for bags in T3 rather cramped. Easy signage and short walk to T1. Check in very quick and smooth. Good signage to security which is spacious and no lines at all - early afternoon - understand it is busier in the mornings. This was a Friday afternoon. Very helpful and pleasant staff. Second time I have used this airport in October and find it a very convenient and preferable alternative to Heathrow. Waiting area for flights at the gate less good - flight was delayed and had to walk to plane. Little space for seating and rather dark and cramped being the only downside.,8.0
1000,"Tried the New York to Manchester to Doha route on the way to Sri Lanka just to check out this alternative to the madness of Heathrow. The airport was much quieter than LHR in the early morning - a plus - but the buses, the elevators (going just two floors back and forth) and the staff were generally so slow that despite having gauged for a couple of hours in between flights, we ended up arriving just in time for our next flight. Most annoying was the security guy who insisted on discarding my TSA compliant eye drops which had passed inspection. (In plastic bag) at Heathrow and all over Europe. I just did not have the time or patience to show him my prescription and from his attitude I doubt it would have worked. He glibly suggested that I could buy them in the terminal but of course there were no such pharmacies on my way to the plane so I ended up having to travel long hours uncomfortably. There seems to be no consistency in Britain regarding what is acceptable. In fact travel through Europe is becoming just a terrible hassle because of variable procedures. I was happy to arrive in the East where no one shouts about shoes and belts and liquids. I doubt that I will travel through Manchester again.",3.0
1001,"After surprising my girlfriend with a trip to Paris and turning up 2 hours early to ensure we could get food in the terminal before the flight, I was disgusted at the complete lack of customer service at Terminal 3. Specifically the security where we were held for an hour and a half whilst the over zealous security staff pulled my girlfriends bag aside because her hair straighteners were in the bag (never happened anywhere else in the world I have travelled.) The bag was swabbed first time round came back clean. Went through the process again, straight to the back of the queue, found it utterly ridiculous that the bags that had already been searched weren't prioritised. This time the problem was a dry deodorant which is not a liquid last time I checked. She had to throw it away, lipstick was the next problem. The third time it went through they picked up trace amounts of nitrates (from mud in my car). We were then held for another 20 mins whilst they processed the findings. Most ridiculous bit was the fact that they didn't even ask to see a boarding pass or passport. So much for safety!! I found it so frustrating that I went to complain about the poor process to the supervisor who proceeded to tell me that he was ensuring the safety of all the passengers. I mentioned the fact that they were also providing a service and that the process just needed to be looked at with regards to searching the whole bag before putting it back through to check. To add fuel to the fire my girlfriend had flown in from Dublin that morning with no problems. When I posed the question does that mean Dublin, Birmingham, Brisbane, US don't care about our safety I was told that they weren't adhering to protocol. When I suggested that the bag check process was stupid and that they should prioritise bags that had already been searched he laughed in my face. We went from being two hours early to running for the flight. Somebody seriously needs to sort this out as I will not be flying from Manchester ever again after this experience. To top it off after an hour and a half in security we then proceeded towards the gates and were stopped because there was a flight disembarking. There is a gate that is in between security and the other gates and they stop you if a plane has just landed. I couldn't have made it up. When we said we were late for the flight we were told to just wait. As I said earlier never again. If I could have given 0/10 I would have done",1.0

Security was courteous and although my bag was chosen for additional screening, they said it had a lot of wires in it - who doesn't these days, we were airside in a few minutes. Good array of shops. Returning lunchtime on an October Sunday the airport was quiet with low queues at immigration and automated gates all in operation so we were into the baggage hall within ten minutes of disembarking, mostly taken up with the very long walk from the jetty.

1004,"This is an awful airport, almost as bad for old people as Heathrow. I have knee replacements and one of my traveling companions has a hip replacement. We were pulled out of line and wanded and patted for what seemed like forever. Every other airport just waved us through. A wheelchair had been requested for me, and none showed up, and nobody could tell me what chaotic line I had to stand in to get one. A woman my age who was traveling in my group was given an extra bag for her liquid and cream cosmetics, while mine were abruptly confiscated from my cosmetics bag, even though it was all tiny sizes. Because I had seeds that were attached to a magazine I bought in their own duty-free shop, I had to go through an extra search even though I admitted that I had them as the customs form said. I wasn't certain that two tiny packets of strawberry and basil seeds were dangerous. The desk had a sign that didn't mention seeds at all, just that one couldn't take away plants, yet the seeds were confiscated without any explanation. Why sell them at duty-free if you can't take them with you? It was an awful experience, chaotic and bullying. The worst part is that the plastic bin with my purse with passport and money and my laptop zipped through the conveyor scrutinizer and sat on the end for a good five minutes while I was being pointlessly frisked. It would have been very easy for a thief to walk away with both. Not a good place for elderly travelers.",1.0

Arrivals is confusing if you don't know the lay out. From baggage reclaim you have to navigate through a ridiculously small shop selling perfume and booze, why its there I have no idea. Never see anyone buying. T2 is probably the best, good layout easy to navigate. Like any airport Manchester works best when it is fully staffed, but it just cannot manage peak periods.",5.0
1007,"OK I am a frequent flyer, but this was my first time using Manchester airport. After landing, the wait for luggage was 35 minutes. Then, try as hard as I might - I could not find my way out of Terminal 1. In every airport, there are huge signs that say ""EXIT - taxis, buses this way"" etc. Not in this terminal. After wandering around backwards and forwards, an assistant pointed me to a goods lift, which led down to a car park, from where I had to walk around the building, before reaching what was actually the main entrance. But I was out at least. On my way back, I managed to find the same entrance - but then the whole business of check-in A and check-in B was a bit confusing. The signs don't explain which you should go to. An assistant noticed I was baffled - she asked which airline I was flying with. I said TAP Portugal. She asked me twice more, but did not seem to understand. In the end she said I know you're going to Portugal, but which airline? I said T-A-P Portugal is the airline. She said she hadn't heard of it. She works there every day. Regarding wifi - there are options, but the free one is only free for one hour. The others either don't connect, or else are too weak to sustain. I had higher hopes for Manchester - thinking that being the 3rd busiest airport in the UK, it would be sharp and well organised. But the fact that I got lost plus the assistant had never heard of a moderately well know (old) airline makes me a bit hesitant to recommend this airport for the business traveller who wants things to be smooth and self-explanatory. Queues however were well handled and the staff were generally friendly. Departures lounge was nice and clean. Main check-in hall a bit dim and dusty. There's the usual WH Smth and Boots outlets as far as shopping is concerned.",3.0
1008,"Security at terminal 3 on Sunday 4 Oct 2015 was a disgrace. So many people delayed because of an excessive number of bags held for recheck. I almost missed my flight, but there is no priority given to the rechecks if your flight is imminent. The woman who rechecked my bag just made a judgement about me because I was late to the airport. Apart from fact she knew nothing about me nor why I was delayed getting to the airport she thought she had the right to comment. While I was waiting (not having my bag rechecked or dealing with security, my phone rang (a concerned friend). I quickly told them I was stuck in security. This same woman then told me I was not allowed to use my phone. There is no sign in that area to say that I could not use my phone. Why was my bag rechecked? Because I had a hard wax hair application. Have travelled with this not in a clear plastic bag through at least 7 airports in the UK and only Manchester said it needed to be in the clear plastic bag.

1009,My family and I have just returned home to via Manchester Airport on the 1st Oct after a 2 week holiday in Cyprus. After a 4.5 hour flight arriving in M/C at approx 3 am we and 350+ passengers were extremely tired and just wanted to be processed by customs etc as quickly as possible. Unfortunately for us this did not happen. We had to queue for well over 30 minutes to at passport control because you only had 4 positions manned. We could not use the alternative Automatic E Passport route because it was taped off. What concerns me most is the fact that my daughter has a 2 year old son who she had to carry from the plane together with her hand baggage. When we went to collect our luggage her buggy was last out on the carousel some 30 minutes later. By this time we were the last passengers left in luggage reclaim. All this time my daughter had carry her son around and a rucksack she had on the plane. What made the situation worse was that no member of your airport staff was anywhere to be seen to explain why or apologise for the delay. Surely as the buggy was handed in as we got onto the plane why can’t you return them as the owners as leave the plane?,2.0

We had Priority Boarding and I am at a loss to know what our privilege was. Bags, etc. were placed in large deep bins. The delivery of these bins to a lower shelf was less than consistent. The loaded bins then passed through X-ray and emerged in two lanes, one nearest to be collected (OK) the other lane was behind a glass panel and one was informed (by a sign) that these bags were to be further inspected. It is very difficult to identify one's bag 6 ft away, inside a deep plastic box, behind a glass screen, when 90% are black and any personal identification hidden, and also all backed up. Inspection is at a counter around the corner. Chaos as individuals jostle to see if their bag is being inspected. My hearing is not the best but I vaguely heard a female voice asked for identification of the black bag being held up. Now I could see for the first time our identification ribbon.

At one point the return tray conveyor stopped working and the guy behind the counter who was having to physically collect the trays (on a trolley) was whining about how he doesn't need this after a 10 hour shift.

Out of the 4 trays one went through fine and the other 3 awaited a swab and re-scan. But because it was so busy and they only had 3 people dealing with 2 sides the trays piled up. People were stressed and frustrated. You were trying to keep an eye on your valuables going in one direction, your bags deemed ok in another and trying to stop your kids from stuffing their fingers in the portable a/c units in another, whilst trying to shout ""yes that's my stuff in that tray"" to the security person who is completely blinkered.

Luggage was unloaded and on carousel very quickly. The bad points: Security. Paid £3.50 for the 'fast track' security which was a complete joke. It was holiday season and the queues were horrendous and moving ridiculously slowly. As with my last review some of this was down to completely unprepared holiday makers at security - come on guys, we've had the liquid rules for a long time now. However, a lot of the problems were down to bags being pulled for inspection for no apparent reason. Mine was pulled for asthma inhalers, not on the banned list, don't have to be in a clear bag, never get pulled out for it anywhere else. Asked the security guy why mine was pulled when inhalers are not on any list and the queue was enormous, he couldn't tell me why. Asked the supervisor why, he told me 'it was a liquid'.

When our plane landed from Doha all the EU passport holders got though in around 15 mins with around 6 desks manned the second they were cleared it suddenly went down to one desk manned. So around 30 of us were left waiting for this one officer to deal with us all. While we were waiting two immigration officers who had been dealing with the EU passengers were just sat at closed desks having a loud conversation and sipping tea and other officers were milling around why couldn't they have just helped out for a few minutes and got us all through quicker? There were kids and old people in the queue it was not very nice strange not very pleasant and made me ashamed to be British. Why were these people (including us) treated like this? It took us an hour and ten minutes to get through passport control after getting off the plane; tired and thirsty. Welcome to Britain eh?,
1045,Very poor experience. Paid £3.50 for a Fast Track security clearance. Firstly the Fast Track entrance in the centre of the terminal was closed off a someone was shouting to go over to a door on the far side of the building. I went over and was told to go down the stairs and it seemed like a fire escape and I arrived at security on the next floor down. It seemed there was building working going on so no problem. Then I queued for 30 minutes on a Fast Track! What a rip off. There wasn't that many passengers just that the staff were incredibly slow and were too busy chatting to each other and what a rude bunch they were. The way I was spoken to in particular was disgusting. I fly every week and have never come across any people like this. I'll do my best to avoid this place in future. All in all quite rough.,
1046,Baggage delivery to carousels has deteriorated badly in recent weeks. Today's experience of more than 30 minutes wait is my latest. 45 minute waiting is not usual. They need to get their act together.,
1047,Security arrangements are failing those with disabilities. Some staff trying hard but very difficult for them when working in poorly organised environment with broken equipment and with other members of staff who are both incompetent and rude. My husband has MS and I am 6 months pregnant but an officious member of security staff insisted on separating us and sending my husband who is partially sighted and has mobility problems back by another route. When he got back to the scanners his walking stick was then sent to a broken scanner where it was ignored. I'm afraid I made nuisance of myself walking back in to the secure area to try and get someone to help but if I hadn't we'd have missed our plane.,
1048,Arrived and departed from T3. Queues ok. Biggest gripe is the walk from the terminal to the rain Stn. Some of it is under cover whilst the rest is outdoors although part of the route is sort of protected from the elements. Worst still are the lifts in T3 which you need to use. Although big there are only 2 and they seem to stop randomly. Why is there not a clearly signed set of stairs people could use instead especially if they do not have large/heavy items of luggage. On leaving T3 was a noisy horrid shambles full of people with insufficient seating. Might be ok for holiday makers but for those on business as I was it was unacceptable. For such a big airport serving a very large catchment area its design is a joke and thankfully I don't have to use this airport often.,2.0
1049,Travelled out to Alicante by Ryanair on Tuesday May 19th and back yesterday Friday May 29th. It was pouring down with rain on the 19th. Nobody told us that the airbridges are not used by Ryanair. My wife suffers from Osteo Arthritis in her knees and we had to go down all the stairs from the terminal building down to the tarmac then walk to the plane in the pouring rain and wait at the bottom of the stairs to board the aircraft in the pouring rain. Staff all checking boarding cards (in the dry on board the aircraft) - couldn't care less that everybody was soaked! Same yesterday but luckily the rain had stopped. Security queues very long and slow-especially the e- security queue.,
1050,As many others have said officious unhelpful security staff dirty toilets poor eating options post layout didn't find a road sign to car hire return. Far too much money spent on trying to persuade customers to spend more not enough on facilities.,2.0
1051,First transit through T3 in years. Everything went reasonably smoothly on our outward trip. There were no delays in Security and staff were both cheerful and helpful. The whole terminal was busy but we managed to find seats till our gate was listed. As an infrequent user of T3 though I find the geography of the place confusing but to be fair there does appear to be more than adequate signage. The only slight hiccup before departure was having to thread our way through other queues to reach our gate. Minor irritations on our return: our Ryanair flight had to wait several minutes before it could access its designated stand and the e passport readers were being temperamental (my wife had no problems but I had to be re-directed to a manned desk). Overall however a better experience than expected though we still find Liverpool our preferred option simply because Manchester is so much bigger and busier and consequently everything takes much longer e.g. without any major holdups or any luggage to reclaim it still took us an hour from landing till exiting the car park.,6.0
1052,Out 13/05/15 and back 15/05/15. Not used this place for a good ten years and I now realise why rude security staff who have not really thought about what they are trying to do. Two lines open in T1 with a queue all round the building and most staff having a natter amongst themselves. In the terminal airside a glorified downmarket shopping arcade and next to no seating. Car parking simply a rip off paid for pre-booked parking online only to be stung for another £114 on leaving. 114 reasons to go to another airport in future.,1.0
1053,Landed from Orlando 30 minutes late with Virgin after an hour delay on way out. At Manchester waited an hour after getting to carousel [having gone through checks] for luggage. Airport arrivals hall only our plane so why? Not enough staff or tea break time! Not acceptable given other airports ability to do better especially given delay on a long overnight flight.,3.0
1054,Worst security staff in the UK. Always rude patronising awkward and unpleasant. I travel monthly and now always now choose the 3 hour journey to LHR rather than take the abuse from the egocentric staff at Manchester.,
1055,"Departed Terminal 2 on 10 May 2015. Low passenger traffic at 1.30pm. Terrible experience. My wife and myself both mid seventies were each subjected to body searches and our shoes taken away for X-rays. My search taking place in what appeared to be a storage cupboard. We both had medication with us and this caused great concern with the staff who were concerned with ""substance checks"". Because our body searches were carried out simultaneously we were not in eye contact with our carry on bags. Bottom line is that when our carry on bags were finally cleared and we were told we could take them we gratefully left the area. It was only when we were in the Istanbul airport transit area that we realised that our clear plastic bag of 'liquid' items a small cosmetic bag and a small bag containing all of our medication were all missing from our carry on bags. Anyone with a modicum of medicinal knowledge would have realised that we both had heart problems. So what happened? Total ignorance of passengers health needs? Maybe over zealous officials? Maybe simply incompetence by the officials.",
1056,T3 at 7 am Friday - no-one ahead of me at fast track and regular line virtually non-existent. Security employees chatty and friendly. It all depends on the time/day/weather and just about anything else you can think of! Cant give full marks as they have taken up every bit of space to move with shops/eateries.,8.0
1057,The usual massive queue to check in for the flight. Based on previous experience we paid for fast track through security. A complete waste of time and money. The priority queue took twice as long as the standard one. One particularly miserable operator berated several elderly passengers who were too stressed or deaf to hear his barked instructions. The operators of this airport have spent a fortune on making it easy for passengers to spend money in the myriad of new shops but clearly are unwilling to provide a proper service. Core business an airport? I don't think so. They should be ashamed.,
1058,My experience more positive than some TS for London/New York security quick but was early reasonable food options airside.,8.0
1059,Truly horrendous experience from start to finish going through Manchester T2 both ways. Started off with nowhere to be dropped off so ended up off loading in middle of road by taxi because of lack of space tatty smelly out of date cowshed of a building. But the staff at passport control are the low point no words exchanged just grunts and pointing of fingers no eye contact just miserable faces to greet you in and out of the UK. There must be a better way.,
1060,The worst airport in the UK? Arrived at 12.25 am 29/03/2015 got to the corridor leading to the immigration desks only to find that the queue was not just in the zig-zags leading to the desks but up the corridor. The shocking thing was that it was only our flight that was queuing at the time and that the e-passport terminals were all closed. When we eventually got to the desk I joked that at least the e-passport machines must have a good scrap value (at that time I thought they were broken) only to be told that they were closed every night. This is because the airport won't pay for someone to be on hand to help people who are stuck at the machines. Now honestly there are 5 machines and it would take 1 relatively unskilled but helpful person to keep them open 24/7. But no it needed 4 border control desks open and still the queues are unacceptable. At least I thought the good news is that our bags would be ready for us on the carousel oh no life can't be that good at Manchester airport there were no signs up to say where to expect our bags and no bags on any carousel. Eventually a few bags appeared on one carousel and we thought here we go but all but 2 were quickly snatched up and we were left waiting for another 20 minutes until the rest started coming round. Oh yes and the meet and greet service should be re-named park and walk you have to exit the terminal walk all the way through the car-parks and eventually your back at your car a trolley would be helpful. Even Ryanair has managed to tidy up its act after losing customers through poor money- grabbing service.,
1061,Very rude security staff at Terminal 1 talk to travellers in a very rude way. Is this because they know you will not challenge them? Understand they have a job to do but they need a course in customer service if these idiots worked anywhere else they would be sacked.,
1062,Had a Qatar Airways flight out of T2 at 19.30 on March 5th. Arrived early checked in easily enough with the airline as usual shortage of staff at security. Having got through security I was amazed to find that at all the shops and food outlets close at 16.30 the only place open was duty free. So if you have evening flight out of T2 be sure to eat before you arrive or take a pack up. Was not a great start to my trip.,4.0
1063,Used T2 for the first time in a while since AF/KL moved out. I was on the new CX service to Hong Kong and onwards to Sydney and back. Business Class so fast track and lounge outbound. Security a breeze for once business lounge is charmless with limited facilities and no view (as ever). Returning we were the first flight in at 0545. Walked straight through immigration to find our luggage already on the carousel straight through customs. In the public Arrivals area 15 minutes after landing. Can't do better than that. We then spent an embarrassing 10 minutes circling the car park having forgotten where we left it. T2 is so much better than T1 or T3. Why do so few airlines use it?,8.0
1064,Arrived in from an 8 hour night flight to be greeted with an exceptionally large queue for not only the automated passport immigration but the manned desks also as several flights had landed around the same time. The front of the UK/EU passport queue had a very large number of Saudi's from a large Saudi Airlines flight and I admit that they could have been dual passport holders however the amount of time to process them I would say not as we were waiting over 1 hour with young children and elderly persons forced to be herded like cattle. Some members of the Large Virgin 747 flight verbally displayed their concerns and disbelief at the lack of efficiency within the immigration hall to be confronted with a large presence of police (more than actual immigration staff) standing there in a display of power and authority telling us to pipe down. 12 immigration desks with only 6 staff manning them? As many if not more police were present! Wouldn't tax payers money be spent more wisely on more UKBA immigration officers as opposed to overt unarmed police presence at the border? I certainly won't travel through Manchester again as Birmingham Heathrow and Gatwick are much more efficient and professional.,
1065,Landed on time and despite the very long walk from the air jetty to passport control we were through immigration collected bags and out of the airport in about 30 minutes which is pretty good especially when dealing with a full A380 plus other flights.,8.0
1066,Arriving at Manchester Terminal one last Sunday 1 March off a TAP flight we were greeted with a sea of people from all directions trying to get to immigrations. It was complete bedlam with a single rude women barking at passengers demanding we all walk to the back of the queue. Really unpleasant experience I have also had very slow progress trying to get through security so my opinion of Manchester Airport is certainly below average. On the other hand Liverpool Airport which I also use is normally a breeze to pass through. I will be looking at LPL more often in future.,2.0
1067,"First the good: security lines are generally shorter for frequent flyers which is a definite plus during holiday season when the airport can fill with not the most savvy travel set. The T3 Escape Lounge is adequate even nice given how busy and cramped that terminal is. Emirates Lounge Virgin Lounge are both excellent. Airport shopping is decidedly down-market which I think is pretty nice (how many Mont Blanc pens does one need?) Having both Boots and WH Smith available is great. There is a train station at the airport too which is great (it's a nice little station but it does get busy.) Since it goes directly to Manchester Piccadilly you can pretty much get anywhere (relatively) directly from MAN via train. For the most part service is good at MAN. Immigration officials have always been courteous and professional with me. Now the bad: 1. Even in the ""Fast Lanes"" security is very slow. If you are unfortunate enough to have your bag separated for extra screening the process is excruciatingly slow. This happens to me about one in three trips. Be early. For some reason Manchester uses lots of employees to board a plane the security questions no one in the world continues to ask are asked twice if you are on a direct to the US. I at one time thought this was a US thing but it isn't it's a Manchester thing (the same thing does not happen in London Paris or Amsterdam for instance.) 2. The airport layout is nonsensical. There is this weird airport wide prohibition of ANY luggage on the escalators. They put up quite elaborate gates to prevent you from using the escalators with say a roller board (you are instructed to use the lifts.) Everyone ignores this stupid prohibition which I have never seen anywhere else in the world (30 countries hundreds of airports.) It's weird. 3. Taxi pickup is unnecessarily burdensome for both passenger and driver. In Terminal 2 for instance savvy drivers will pull up to passenger drop off to pick you up. 4. Arriving in Manchester can be hit and miss. Sometimes it is great for non-EU passport travellers like me (they are separated from EU passengers regardless of residency.) Sometimes it is horrendous. The immigration officers are typically very nice however. Speaking of if you arrive in Terminal 3 and need to get to the train fast avoid the lifts that take you to the parking garage. Instead follow the path from Terminal three and when you just arrive at Terminal 1 take the two small elevators to ""Terminal One Departures."" Enter the departure hall and ignoring the bags on escalator prohibition take the small escalators and you will be in the sky bridge to the train station. You can easily save five minutes getting to the station which if you are late can mean the difference between getting and missing a train. Terminal One is by far the nicest terminal three is a bit shabby and two is crowded (and also shabby.) Because the boarding areas are so poorly designed (meaning without any effort to facilitate people actually boarding airplanes) this is one airport that being a frequent flyer is a real plus. Being in the NW and without another international option MAN is my home airport. If I get through it hassle-free that's the best I can expect. At least I can take comfort that upon arrival I am almost home. The train is a real plus too. Otherwise be prepared for ridiculous security not great amenities boarding hassles and an otherwise mediocre experience.",3.0
1068,"First experience of Terminal 3 on a Tuesday afternoon in February for some daft reason I thought it might be a pleasant and quiet experience. The first issue was immediately being shouted at by a charming young lady handing out clear plastic bags before security. She just seemed to scream at everyone (and anyone) for no apparent reason. Next up was the carnage which was security a wait of 45 mins underneath the hottest roof spotlights in queues which went nowhere fast. The number of passengers waiting was actually quite low it just took an excessive amount of time. Finally once it was our turn to be screened we were met by incredibly rude staff. Now sometimes people say that staff are rude whilst they are simply just being efficient and doing the job with no fuss this wasn't the case. These security staff were frankly disgraceful rude remarks to simple questions and then providing zero information when the whole screening machine/process temporarily broke down. So got through security and looked forward to grabbing a coffee. Exited the security section to be met by a red barrier across the corridor it turns out that a toddler designed this section of terminal 3. If a plane is disembarking from some gates you cannot walk from one section to another speechless! To make this albeit slight inconvenience worse we had to listen to the two female ground staff who were guarding this red barrier and supervising the disembarkation of the British Airways Airbus (at 16.25ish on Tues 3rd Feb 2015). They seemed to relish being able to control a large group of passengers who were now running rather late thanks to security delays and who were now stuck between this red barrier and security. Some passengers were really late and asked if they could be let through to the gates it turns out that at least this is possible. But only once you had been spoken to like a child and told ""your too late"" and ""should have got to security earlier"" (really). They then spent the remainder of this lovely encounter laughing and joking about the plight of those late passengers in front of about 50 passengers. Brilliant. Finally boarded a nice peaceful aircraft after one of the rudest most uncomfortable airport experiences I have ever encountered. I will never fly from this terminal again at Manchester. Why is it so much worse than the other two terminals? Maybe I had a bad experience but not once did I come across a ""non-rude"" member of staff until reaching the departure gate. Shameful and back to Liverpool airport I shall go.",
1069,The prices are very expensive and they think they have trapped customers with no alternative. The only item at the market price was s newspaper and the customers is supposed to go through a lengthy process on a computer to buy one. This while a staff member stands there doing nothing.,
1070,Stopping on a connecting flight I thought that the process would be quick and painless. After searching tirelessly for an employee or information centre I was promptly greeted with a shrug of the shoulders. After politely asking my question I waved off in a direction and mumbled at with a swear word uttered under there breath. The facilities are poor and unclean. Blocked toilets and rude staff. I hope I never travel through Manchester airport again.,
1071,Flew out of Manchester to Heathrow from T3 on Christmas Day so there were very few flights operating and the airport was very quiet. Surprisingly though getting through security was a slow process and we had to queue for around fifteen minutes. Not a long time in normal circumstances but when there are only a handful of people ahead of you it was baffling. The security process has an air of disorganisation about it. Once through duty free was open as was the newsagent and cafe/bar in the centre. There isn't an awful lot more in that terminal anyway. All very quiet. As it was quiet it was a reasonable experience but I wouldn't like to have to pass through T3 in the height of summer.,7.0
1072,Airport is clean and my trip was to US for a week. Security while going out was dreadful took long time there was larger number of people in US airport but they were very efficient or I would say dogmatic. Immigration check is scandal took nearly an hour in the line. Very grumpy that is first thing in the morning. They need to learn a lot more from US airport about customer relations.,2.0
1073,25 minute wait to get through passport check in T1. Bags waiting on the carousel. Paid for fast-track security on departure to avoid any stress. Needn't have bothered as no queues. Adequate catering facilities but too many 'duty free' shops.,7.0
1074,Arrived at T1 on 13th November 2014 to be greeted by a horrendous queue for security. The queue stretched outside the terminal building and into the car park and this is winter time not peak season! Unbelievable inefficiency. I felt sorry for the foreign travellers who had no idea what was going on. Heaven knows what they must think about this airport I felt embarrassed to be British.,
1075,This is a dreadful airport - avoid at all costs! Not only is security a shambles (45 minutes on my last visit last week) but the staff are surly and unhelpful; always a sign of bad management in my experience. It claims to be open 24 hours but I can assure you that terminal 3 effectively shuts down at 20:30. One bar one restaurant and a couple of shoddy shops (WHSmith Boots) just doesn't cut it I'm afraid especially for the volume of traffic they're cramming in to such a small space. Really poor they should be ashamed but I get the impression it's run by individuals who won't care about bad reviews.,
1076,I use Manchester a lot and the one constant is the slow and inefficient security procedure. Whilst some of this is simply down to a lack of staff a lot of it is down to passengers just not being prepared. Flew out early on Saturday 15th from T3 - very short queues through security but we were all held up by totally unprepared people in front of us. Liquids not in clear bags not taking laptops out banned items not putting all their metal items/coins in trays etc. Once through security the airport is quite clean with enough shops/bars to keep you happy while waiting for your flight but there are often times I've not been able to use them as it's taken so long to get through security. It's a good airport but they really need to sort out the shambles that is security.,6.0
1077,I have criticised Manchester Airport many times for its terrible queues both at security and border control when returning. Went out of T2 on 4th November and returned on 21st very fast at security and border control. I may of been lucky because there is still lots of complaints but I have to comment on the experience I had.,8.0
1078,On return to T1 from Australia apart from March up and down stairs to passport control was in fact very quick and efficient baggage started coming out almost immediately my experience is better than most.,8.0
1079,"What a shambles on Thursday 14th November the queue to clear security snaked from the security gates up and down the barriers along the corridor out into the check-in hall along the front of other check in desks out of the door 500 yds across the front of terminal 1 and then even across the zebra crossing and back on itself. I joined the queue at 07.30 for a 8.45 departure and if it had not been for mine and some other passengers on my Emirates flight to Dubai insistence to an official who allowed us access to the ""fast lane"" at 08.20 we would have missed our flight. As it was I finally sat in my seat airside at 08.40. It needs sorting out Manchester authorities or you will loose custom!",
1080,On a Sunday morning at T3 after an eventless KLM flight from AMS. No lines at immigration and without luggage on my way to the train station within 5 minutes. The airport itself doesn't have a very welcoming feeling it looks a bit rundown. A long walk including going up on an elevator at T2 at least 15 minutes to the train station. In and out of buildings. For the return flight again arriving by train and the long walk to T3. This time checked in a suitcase at the AF/KL desk. No one in front so direct service from a friendly employee. Then the nonsense starts: first of all the security check. Someone mumbling you have to go line 11 a group of security staff members extremely busy amongst themselves and an attitude that would do a TSA officer in the US proud. Waiting in a small and overcrowded lounge for the flight and the gate to appear. Then a dash through the shopping mall to the gate where too many people are gathering with very few seats and no queuing. Boarding a free for all. Arrival is reasonable but flying out is a pretty poor experience.,3.0
1081,Requested help in placing luggage on check in conveyor due to my age of 83 and my wife in a wheelchair. A male member of staff was sitting at a desk 3 meters away but refused due to health and safety. Fortunately a passenger in the next queue volunteered and lifted our cases which incidentally were under weight. It was also suggested we should take less luggage. The queue in security was horrendous with wheel chairs perambulators and children racing up and down crashing into legs. Later when in lounge noticed the aircraft seats were not the reserved longer legroom seats but at the back of the aircraft. Fortunately the passenger help desk managed to obtain long legroom seats. Our return to Manchester was utterly chaotic waiting for wheelchairs at the plane. After waiting 45 minutes the appropriate 10 chairs arrived with 5 operators who promptly disappeared leaving just one two or three people gave up and pushed their partners through miles of corridors. The luggage was not on the conveyor stated but on the next one. No one there to assist so I and two other elderly people lifted their cases off the conveyor belt. My wife balanced one case on her lap whilst I pushed the chair and one case. The airport in Tenerife was completely opposite. Manchester makes me thoroughly ashamed.,
1082,Every aspect of MAN airport is poorly executed from the car parking the ancient and wobbly lifts security - the rules seem to change daily but the one constant being you know anytime of day you go the queues will be long and slow. We are now forced to be subjected to your shopping arcades of perfume and alcohol before being forced into shoddy waiting areas and the inevitable delayed departure. The worst experience is saved for arrivals. Always a long wait to get off the plane. We are then subjected to going through tiny entrances up stairs in dingy corridors down stairs then upstairs again! I'm embarrassed as a local when I see visitors struggling with the route to immigration. 15-25 minute waits to clear immigration for nationals. Immigration officials with folded arms usually 3 or 4 behind the counters doing nothing. It's very frustrating to see empty booths whilst staff look on. Then the final indignation - baggage. Most inefficient airport for baggage delivery. We are then subjected to the dingy arrival halls and trying to find a taxi - which the service has been fouled up spectacularly.,
1083,First time flying out of Terminal 3 and hopefully the last - the whole place had a neglected feel about it. Usual surliness from the security staff who seemed to stand around in groups chatting and couldn't be bothered making eye contact - just exaggerated hand gestures in the general direction of customers. Usual overpriced food and drinks. Thankfully our flight was on time as I would dread to have to spend any length of time here felt claustrophobic and soulless this area needs major money throwing at it to bring it up to standard.,4.0
1084,I fly weekly to Ireland and avoid Manchester unless possible. T3 customs totally inadequate and can never cope. Always huge lines and building just not big enough everyone has to squeeze through a 1.5m wide gap at the end of a customs desk to reach departures. Can't see how it meets fire regs. T3 departures hardly any seats and seems set up so you must purchase something from one of the outlets in order to get a seat! I fly through numerous airports every year and the customs staff are easily the rudest and most awkward. My experiences include being given a lecture for having an apple in my bag being made to take off my glasses to go through the scan and instructed to collect all the trays from past customers - surely their job! T1 a lot better and able to cope! Finally why I understand the use of buses to take people off arriving flights but why are T1 arriving Irish passengers bussed to the back service door to get off the bus adjacent to wheels bins service cans and bins? Second class? To caution in most airports you can be landside 30 mins from landing max at Manchester it takes at least 45 and often longer with customers being left waiting on buses until the airport opens the doors to let you in.,4.0
1085,"I like this airport and use it almost exclusively for my two annual trips aboard. But why do they continue to advertise their ""executive"" lounges when there is never any space available in them? And why when returning at 1.00am on Sunday 25th October at the same time as 3 or 4 other flights were they taken by surprise that we all wanted to go through border control. The queue stretched all the way down the arrivals concourse astonishing that they are not able to see when flights are due and no there were no delayed flights arriving late. The wonderful speedy lanes for E passports were closed and no reason given this would have alleviated the situation enormously I love you Manchester Airport but they do let themselves down some times and my score this time is based on this most recent dreadful experience.",1.0
1086,Flew from terminal one - admittedly had fast track security pass as was business class but queues in general not too long and staff not unpleasant as previously reported used Emirates lounge which was fine terminal - food appeared pricey.,8.0
1087,Landed at terminal 2 at 14.20 and was greeted by what can only be described as chaos. 3 planes had landed in quick succession and the queues at passport control were horrendous - at least 500 people waiting even though we had an e-passport we were told to join the huge queue as the line at the e-passport gate was in danger of blocking the exits. After a very long wait we were greeted by the chaos that was the baggage of two planes being put on the one carousel. After a lovely holiday to come home to be greeted by what only can be described as utter chaos was too much - will I be travelling from Manchester again? I don't think - there was a total lack of staff around to help with any problems.,
1088,From as much as we have travelled Manchester Airport is easily the worst experience! Travelled this afternoon from terminal 3. We arrived at the airport 2.5 hours prior to our flight within Europe which should have been plenty of time. There were 11 lanes available for security check everyone was pushed into lanes 9 through 11 while the security officers in lanes 1-8 were just standing there. We were in a queue with a sick child for well over 1.5 hrs and no toilet facilities available. Due to the slow security we missed any chance to get some lunch for our children and nearly missed our flight altogether! All our hand-luggage containing nothing out of the ordinary in it was turned inside out several times and had to go through x-ray 5 times over! The security officers working the line were obviously totally incompetent as to what they were doing and also extremely rude.,
1089,We arrived at Terminal 2 with carry on bags with 1 hour and a half before flight plenty of time we thought. However the queue to get through security was appalling. 1 hour later we got through to find our plane was boarding. What should have been a start to a surprise holiday for my 60th birthday left me completely stressed out. This is not a good advertisement for Manchester Airport.,
1090,I travelled to Southampton airport via Terminal 3 on Friday and it was a dismal experience. Who is responsible for the Customer service here? Staff at security appear demoralised and disengaged at best at worst thuggish. Passing through security I was instructed to remove my boots by an operator without a trace of politeness. The scanning technology on the approach to the departure gate which has replaced some staff is lamentable and I was instructed to 'put on your glasses' 'stand on the footsteps' and 'lift your chin' before being passed to a man at a desk who was perfectly polite but clearly resigned to a system which is inefficient and ends up with the customer (yes customer) being treated like a criminal suspect. The whole experience was disrespectful and a lesson in how to provide a customer-alienating service. I will not travel from Terminal 3 again.,
1091,Travelled on 16th September arrived at 0615 for 0925 departure. I have never before been so pleased that I was travelling business class. The queues for security seemed endless. Even though we had access to the fast track lane it took 30 minutes to reach a point where we could access fast track and after that it took 15 minutes to get through security even though all the lanes were working. I felt really sorry for the people who had to endure up to two and a half hours waiting to get through security. Unfortunately we are due to fly from Manchester again in February 2015 really will consider changing departure airport if at all possible. Facilities at Manchester are also very poor it is a a very poor advert for Manchester and Britain.,
1092,"I arrived into Manchester after a two month travel seeing some six countries and 12 flights the previous two weeks had seen me injure my hip and unable to walk unaided for very far. Australia Hong Kong Helsinki the service couldn't have been better customer service personnel spotted a problem and helped me on my return to Manchester however I found the luggage trolley locked up needing an unreturnable pound coin to release one. I can't carry my luggage and my 5' girlfriend surely can't carry two 20kg rucksacks? I ask the young lady in a yellow vest ""how do I get a trolley?"" ""I dunno not my problem see management"" came the reply. After two phone calls lots of hobbling about I managed to get a trolley! Welcome home to England.",
1093,Have been to this airport many times and it remains one of the most poorly laid-out and unnecessarily complicated places to navigate in through and out of. Arrived at T3 on a domestic flight and walked miles to the exit. The design and protocols of the sign-posting are nothing like as clear as they should be and as you find for instance at Heathrow and other BAA locations like Southampton. Rented a car and needed to return it later that day to the on-airport Hertz location but identifying the location was almost impossible. Every airport I have ever been to in the world has signs as you approach advising 'Rental Car Return'. Not at MAN. Not one single sign anywhere. Quite absurd and caused a lot of time to be wasted.,2.0
1094,"Was going to give a good report for this airport based on our experience for our departure - check-in by staff was efficient and quick and although the queue was long the security staff were also efficient. We had made sure we had prepared ourselves properly such as belt money etc was in hand luggage and iPads were easily to hand. We were let down was on the return (flight TOM163 from Puerto Vallarta 26/09/2014). Aircraft was 35 minutes early into MAN and it was known before we left PVR that we would be early. After a 9 hour overnight flight from the Pacific coast of Mexico the plane had to park up (with engines running) because there were no stands available and we were told his would be about 15 minutes. After about 45 minutes the captain advised that we were still without a stand and apologised for the delay. After an hour we were advised that after ""speaking"" to the Manchester Airport Authorities the aircraft had been allocated a stand but unfortunately we were to be bussed to the terminal after deplaning down the steps. The only good to come out of this situation was immigration and luggage collection was exceptionally quick for this airport.",5.0
1095,Appalling. Arrived 4am. Queue to get to the car park queue to get in to the car park queue to check in bags queue to get to security queue to get through security catch flight if you are lucky. Staff appalling too and have obviously spent too much time on diversity training courses and too little on customer service. It's not all bad news though - if you still have time to go to the loo they have ritual washing facilities!,
1096,Our return from Canada into Terminal 1 was fairly easy although were we amongst the first off the aircraft and there were no others flights before us. There were only 2 desks open for passport checks and I felt sorry for the non-EU people in the long queue adjacent to ours who would have to wait a long time as the single official laboriously checked their documents. We also had only one official and he had to constantly deal with people entering the queue from the electronic scanning machines which kept breaking down. Once through we found the signage to the airport meet-and-greet to be quite poor leading us to leave by the wrong door and resulting in a long push of the cart outside. And why do they charge £1 for the cart? Most other airports supply them for free and the low uptake at Manchester must mean the scheme looses money!,5.0
1097,Judging by the amount of negative reviews I must have flown from a different airport. Check-in was effortless. Security took less than 2 minutes so did not need the fast-track I paid for. Security staff were polite and professional. The shopping area was a bit weird and the smoking area was a godsend! I do appreciate that many travellers will face delays so I was probably in the right place at the right time.,10.0
1098,Queues at check-in and security need to be shortened. Took 30 mins to check in and 40 to clear security. Businesses must be suffering as passengers have not time to shop or eat. Airport claims to be trying to ease the situation but it is clearly not working.,5.0
1099,Arrived back to the UK before 11pm on Sunday and queues at passport control were horrendous - all the way down the corridor long before you even saw the passport control area. Queues to the Non UK & Non EU control was very short with maximum 10-20 people at any one time . Also the E-passport gates were closed. The only good thing was that at our bag was at the carousel when we eventually got through. We travel to Finland often and at that end the non-EU passport lane is 'All Passports' which means EU passport holders can spread out to that one as well when it is busy. Maybe something the UK should consider?,5.0

1101,We flew from Manchester on 31/8/2014. On arrival we noticed there was 2 check-in desks open for 2 flights. Fortunately we had got there early and we still queued for just over an hour. The rather unfriendly lady on the desk made us open our cases to balance the weight all our cases were under the required weight. When we finally rid of our cases the queue was like a snake all the way down the terminal. It was absolute joke your holiday starts at the airport. You need more (friendly) staff at the check-in desks and let people start their holiday in a happier frame of mind.,2.0
1102,Awful airport out and on return. Left via terminal 1. We were in the 'fast' queue with kids and it took us an hour to go through security. I saw some people horrified as they were about to miss flights. Returned via terminal 2. Immigration are the most miserable disrespectful and sullen people in creation. Just what you want to see after returning from a holiday.,
1103,Came back through T yesterday. Customs hall dangerously overcrowded. Thousands of people and more pushing from behind as they came down the stairs into the hall. Its a serious accident waiting to happen. Woefully short of staff - took us an hour to get through customs. thankfully bags were there when we finally got to baggage reclaim - including two guys unloading them off the carousel as there was no one there to collect them as everyone in the customs hall still!,
1104,"The airport advises to allow 3 hours for check in due to tightened security checks! We arrived on Sunday 31st August at 3.20am for a 5.30am departure. The queue in the said security area was horrific the security agent was stopping passengers scanning board cards to access the security area it was chaos. The agent was also shouting ""wait five minutes the staff don't start till 4am"" so I ask myself why arrive before 4am if the staff are not available to process you? Perhaps if the Airport spent less money on retail outlets and invested in staffing passengers would have time to spend money instead of standing in queues and listening to a battle axe bellow at you!",
1105,Truly awful experience at passport control .queue stretched down corridor yet queue for non EU was very short. Eventually we passed through immigration thinking at least our bags would be ready sadly they were not took one hour 15 minutes from getting off plane to receiving baggage - a shambles. Get your act together Manchester!,
1106,It is dreadful - I am mostly familiar with T1. Unfortunately the staff in Security seem uninterested in their work and are very seldom pleasant with the passengers. Many of them appear more than 30 years older than staff doing the same job in other airports. A few weeks ago I forgot to take a bottle of liquid out of my hand luggage but it was never noticed! The building is not clean is lacking paint in some areas and in places the flooring is a disgrace. There is a total lack of lifts and escalators - the ones that are there seldom work. Older people do not have a chance and none of the airport staff appear to care I have complained so many times about escalators not working but it makes absolutely no difference. The eating areas are not particularly restful or pleasant and the prices are very expensive. It is a sad situation.,
1107,I was not looking forward to using Manchester for our trip to Canada after reading reviews on here. I purchased the fast track security pass. Best £7 I've spent! We were able to bypass the huge queues to the desks and were through with minimal fuss. After that the shops were quite good and the information screens were numerous and clear but no PA announcements. Hope it's as good on our return!,7.0
1108,I've been flying in and out of terminal 1 a lot the last twelve months (with Lufthansa). I truly loathe this terminal. For flights around 06.00 to 06.30 the security queues are horrendous. They have to constantly call flights to pull passengers forward to avoid missing flights. Arriving back you usually have to go down and back up steps due to the badly thought out separation of departing and arriving passengers ad then there is always a big queue for passport control and the e-passport gates hardly ever work. This terminal is run down dirty scruffy generally awful. Arriving back here is like arriving back in time somewhere in the early 1970's. The only redeeming feature is the good selection of shops in the departures lounge. It used to be a much much better place.,2.0
1109,August Bank holiday weekend claimed to be the busiest of the year yet at 8pm all the shops in T1 (except duty free) were closed. Couldn't even buy a coffee or magazine! I visit family in Manchester regularly and this airport is getting worse and worse a real embarrassment to the city.,4.0
1110,Travelled to Malta Saturday 9th August returned 23rd Aug. Very nearly missed our outbound flight due to security queues arrived 2 hours before flight so should have been plenty of time. Had to run to the gate. Security staff very rude and unhelpful but can hardly blame them - if I was faced by those queues for hours I would probably be grumpy as well. Returning the queues at passport control were long but quick moving our problem was baggage collection. Initially screens telling us they were coming to one belt then after half hour wait was directed to another one which had 3 flights bags arriving at the same time. It was utter chaos and very disorganised. I will certainly think twice before travelling from Manchester again.,
1111,"Appalled by the extremely large queue at passport control when returning to Manchester airport on 15th August at 1.30am. Only five members of staff checking passports one male member of staff stood looking over his colleagues shoulder not assisting in any way. The queue snaked along the corridor of the terminal and it took approximately 30 minutes to even reach the zig-zag area. A number of flights had obviously landed and there must have been over 1000 people many with young children and babies waiting in the queue. The electronic desks were not in use! What is the point of having one of these passports if you are unable to use the facility they are issued for? When we finally reached a member of staff after waiting over an hour we complained only to be told in a flippant response ""Well it is a busy time of the year"". I then used the toilet facilities which were dirty and didn't appear to have been checked. Not a good impression for any traveller entering the UK. I will seriously consider choosing an alternative airport next time I travel. Use Manchester at your peril!",
1112,Three of us including my 77 year old father travelled Manchester to Lanzarote. Depart date 31st July 07.20hrs with Thomas Cook booked cases online dropped cases off no problem at all. The chaos started going through security the queue started in the booking-in hall then snaked all the way through security we queued for over 90 minutes. To compound things airport staff were calling flights that were due to leave within the hour for passengers to make themselves known so they could be rushed through. So many around us were asking what's the point of arriving early might as well arrive late and get rushed through patience was wearing thin and it wouldn't surprise me to hear anytime soon about trouble in this part of the airport. Definitely treated like an animal being herded not pleasant and a bad way to start a holiday. Arrived back at 23.10hrs on Sunday 10th August none of the travelators worked not easy having a tired 77year old with our party and having to walk for a long distance. Then the fiasco at passport control two flights must have landed at the same time so two queues merging and again the animal herding began none of the e-passport machines were working so no option other than to queue. I did notice that the EU route was severely clogged up however the none EU route was empty apart from five people who filled in their cards breezed to the front and where seen to immediately an hour later we were still queuing. When we finally got to passport control we were politely asked if we had enjoyed our holiday yes apart from this fiasco I then pointed to the queue behind me. The Officer handed me a complaint form and said please fill this in and send it back we are sick of telling them about this if enough people complain something will get done. Then we went to baggage re-claim and despite the wait at passport control we expected our cases to be waiting for us yet another half hour wait for cases to arrive. Time taken from landing at 11.10 to departing the airport 01.00hrs almost two hours. I echo what lots of people are saying on here if you have the option of using a different airport do yourself a favour and save yourself a whole pile of stress and grief and go elsewhere! Finally the shops and cafe's must be suffering due to the queuing to get through security time isn't available on the other side to browse and purchase so this must be effecting their business? Surely it would be in their interest to lobby for improvements.,
1113,One of the worst airports in the UK. Security staff obviously hate the job and take their feelings out on the travelling public.,
1114,"2/8/14 MAN-VRN T2. Only issue was the flight status screen in Escape Lounge not updated to show ""now boarding"". 9/8/14 VRN-MAN T2. Couldn't fault. On stand 13.10 at T2 long stay car park 13.45!",9.0
1115,I don't travel internationally a lot and perhaps my expectations aren't unrealistic - but over the course of a long weekend in Venice I experienced 4 airports and only Manchester seemed unable to deal with customers effectively. Is it normal practice for security to come down the line taking groups from particular flights again and again so that they wouldn't miss them - we had checked in online hand baggage only and queued for over an hour until we were bumped to the front so as not to miss our flight. The security officials were rude and unhelpful and clearly over stretched. Through Brussels Frankfurt and Venice (Marco Polo) our transitions were smooth and pleasant but our experiences in Manchester very different. On our return to the UK we queued for about an hour to pass through passport control- the longest elsewhere was five minutes - maybe we were unlucky - but reading other reviews here I don't believe that is the case - can't comment on facilities - we didn't have time to use them.,
1116,I shall be kind to Manchester. Its a shambles. The security at T2 is a disgrace totally unprofessional and very poorly trained. Be afraid if this is all that stands between you and oblivion. Even the restaurants simply cannot cope at peak times and frankly do not even bother trying. The answer however is there to see. Use Liverpool or Leeds. Much better than this airport.,1.0
1117,Horrific is the only word to describe the recent experiences I have had with this airport. I echo the sentiments of other negative reviewers and also pledge to never use this substandard cattle market for as long as is possible. What a dreadful representation of the UK. I am ashamed to call it my 'home' airport.,
1118,Arrived 8.45 and had to wait over one hour for our luggage - International Airport you must be joking - if you don't wait an hour at security then you will at baggage collection or both. Something certainly needs to be done apparently the airport have no control over luggage handlers it is the airlines who control them. Very poor state of affairs in the modern day and age.,5.0
1119,Just like all reviews it depends on the day/month/year/time of day. I have had some slow security experiences but not really much slower than some of the airports which regularly get rave reviews in this forum. Last time leaving early am T3 when all the US flights are leaving no delay at security and when I came back was in my car 15 minutes after the plane doors opened (no luggage.) I wonder if the negative reviews are sometimes the result of not leaving enough time or just plain unrealistic expectations. The staff may not be the most friendly but they aren't at most airports around the world that I use.,6.0
1120,I traveled via T1 to Dubai. I can't say that I had an issue going through security because I had a fast track pass. But to be honest it was only just worth it due to the queue size. I just don't get what the issues are around security your boarding a plane and surely people want to feel safe etc. The hold up on this occasion was passengers on the budget flights (I presume). Completely unprepared don't read the notices and wonder why they get caught up in it all. We followed the signage due to the new rules on electricals put our 100ml liquids in one of those bags and got through quickly. If every person was a bit more attentive I'm sure we'd get through a bit quicker. I'd hate to be a business person travelling daily. Overall it was an ok experience and we even had time to shop and eat. I think the toilets need an overhaul and need to be cleaned more often.,8.0
1121,"Travelled from South Africa via Amsterdam arrived on time 12.35 pm. Then arrived at Immigration and Border control. 700 metre queue 4 deep 2 officious border control officers trying to run crowd control with their usual happy efficient demeanour after asking them to help improve the efficiency. I was told it was an Airport problem. Went back to the 2 border guards and asked them to take some responsibility to ease the chaos (that didn't go down too well). Arrived at the passport check desk only to find that 2 of our loyal dedicated officers were investigating dodgy passports that left 3 officers managing the Chaos. Avoid ""jobsworth"" airport in Manchester they have no idea about customer service.",
1122,Used to be good - many years ago but now it is awful. I travel regularly and because of where I live I have to use this airport. Dirty overcrowded takes far too long to walk from leaving the aircraft to leaving the airport. The staff are stunningly rude. I have written quite a few letters of complaints to them in the past but nothing changes.,
1123,Having read some of the reviews and seen the recent queues at security I was worried about flying from Manchester. On way there my worst fears were confirmed as there was a huge crash on the M6 caused up to not move for 1 hr 45 mins! Thought with the queue at security we would never make our flight but had booked fast track and went straight through and managed to run to the gate with 1 minute to spare! No idea how I managed it with the maze that is the duty free area. Total time from arriving then parking the car through security then running to the gate 10 mins total! Should add I'd checked in online with hand luggage.,10.0
1124,"I flew from Manchester to Dubai on the 10am flight on 18 July. I was fortunate to be flying Business so could go through ""fast track"" and I was through to airside in about 5 minutes. However the normal security queue was absolutely horrendous - it wound it's way all through the roped security area then all the way out of security and along to the very end of the concourse. I have never seen anything like it. I don't know to what extent it was caused by the school holiday rush and to what extent by enhanced security checking but I would be very surprised if travellers got through that queue in an hour to an hour and a half. Security was well staffed and they were doing their best but it was a hopeless mess outside in the general concourse with airport staff trying to call forward people at risk of missing flights - and there were lots of them! On the evidence I saw if you are flying economy through Manchester this summer allow at least an hour more than you normally would.",9.0
1125,Short haul trip to and from Amsterdam. No real queues for bag drop passport control or security. Airport not as clean as Schipol which was very noticeable. Real need for road improvements from the M6 to the airport as some stretches still single carriageway and get very congested. (I concede that this is not in the airport's direct control but they should be lobbying for change). Staff attitude was great. Only real concern was that we had to wait for what seemed like a long while for baggage to appear on the belt. We also watched on the plane as bags were loaded and it seemed that the handlers felt they were not doing their jobs unless each bag was either thrown or dropped onto the belt of left to fall some distance onto the tarmac. Very poor workmanship and total lack of supervision as they worked.,7.0
1126,"I keep trying to convince myself that every time a cheaper flight comes up using Manchester that the last time I went through security there it was a one off a bad day. Unfortunately it's not it's the norm and every time I curse myself and keep telling myself pay the extra and use a different airport. Unhelpful uninterested staff herd you about any form of complaint is immediately dumbed down by the ""abuse"" excuse no matter how polite you try to be. Passengers are clearly an inconvenience to the organisation. I have yet had time to try the duty free or other facilities. I would hate to be a business in one of the terminals who's rent is based on turnover and have targets to hit. Who has time to spend any money there? Hideous airport to be avoided no matter what the cost of the alternative. They should never had been given permission for a second runway they were at breaking point with just the one.",
1127,My gripe with Manchester Airport relates to inward flights and the collection of luggage. May 2013. Return from Rome wait 1 hour 30 mins. July 2014 return from Skiathos wait 50 mins. Not really good enough is it? Both trips from T1.,2.0
1128,As with other passengers I feel the management should look at these reviews. Use Manchester as preference to a trip via London but not out of choice more ease. Escalators and moving walkways out of order unhelpful security and long lines with no thought for passenger care and service cleaning poor and Border control with permanent queues on your return. Having used many airports world-wide these should be simple things to manage and provide to travelling customers. How many passengers choose Manchester or have they no choice? I have contacted the airport to communicate with them with little response.,2.0
1129,One of the worst airport I've used in Europe. Extremely long to check in (even for baggage drop off) and to pass through security! Even CDG is better. Almost 1 hour before having baggage delivered!,
1130,Frequently fly from terminal 1 and occasionally terminal 2. Last trip 3rd June (8am) from terminal 2 was utter chaos at security. 2 belts were working causing huge queues. No staff assisting no flight announcements tense worried travellers rude security staff no apologies no time to shop / spend our money even if we wanted to hardly any time to use the toilet let alone get a drink. Terrible start to a well deserved holiday. Staff ridiculously cramming every single item into the polythene bags excessive and humiliating. I recently travelled to New York (February) incorporating internal flights and the security is much better managed calm organised civilised and polite. On the way home ultra long walk from runway not one walkway functioning. Elderly and vulnerable travellers exasperated. Couldn't be much worse really could it. Skiathos one of the smallest airports in Europe more effectively managed.,2.0
1131,I had a lovely 50th Barcelona Trip booked for me by my daughter on the 7th June. Unfortunately we missed the flight due to what I can only describe as the security cattle market in Terminal 3. The flights were all booked online check in online and boarding passes printed on line a week before we left. On arrival at the airport we joined a queue that was fractious and so long I have never seen anything like it. Staff were asking people to move to the front of the queue depending on their time of flight giving passenger only 20 minutes to go through security. Then to find out that bags were being checked by 1 member of staff who obviously could not cope with it and was not fit for purpose due to her false nails which hindered her ability to open cases and plastic resealable bags. It was appalling to say the least. Airport staff were screaming at each other when asked to fast track families through the queue. Obviously understaffed and unable to cope with the pressure. Hence we amongst other people missed our flight. When we finally arrived at out gate 213 Jet 2 staff said they knew we have gone through security as they could see it on their screen. It was the 1 baggage checker that was causing the back log.,
1132,"According to the airport's website ""it's our mission to make your journey as smooth and simple as possible"". I regret to say that judged by the experience of myself and my wife on 2 trips through the airport this year drastic action needs to be taken to even begin the process of 'mission accomplished' - particularly in the areas of effective staffing security procedures reduction of queues staff training and customer relations. On 27 March at 11.50hrs we arrived at bag drop (2hrs before departure) having checked in online and then spent the next hour or so going through the queues at security. The x-ray scanner for some reason detected a problem with my cabin baggage (after 12 mins wait I was told it was my camera and after another 7 mins or so I was finally cleared without explanation or any word of apology). Staffing appeared inadequate and uncaring as to the needs of customers. We had no time for a coffee or to go to the toilet before boarding. On 7 June we had a repeat performance. Having arrived at terminal 1 at 04.45 (2hrs before departure) once again we spent the entire time before boarding waiting in security queues. This time my wife's cabin baggage was chosen for a random check (passed ok) and mine for search again apparently because it contained a piece of soap in a plastic soap box (perfectly allowable). The security officer did not go to the soap straight away but at a snail's pace opened and took out all my various pills and other items before declaring on opening my washbag that it was the soap causing the query. She could not adequately explain why the scanner/scanner operator should find a piece of soap problematic and I said that I did not believe her explanation (she had just reopened my wash bag for the second time!). To this she replied ""Tough"". Very much a 'take it or leave it approach'.",
1133,Flew in today around noon. All immigration points and automatic scanners were open. UK/EU passport holders had no wait the rest of us maybe 20 minutes which is a standard from my experience. Screeners were polite and took priority on seniors and family's. All walkways working bathrooms were clean. A bit of a trek to get from terminal 1 to terminal 2 where the busses are but again seems the standard distance compared to other airports. A few suggestions are to clearly show which baggage carousel is for which flight and better signage explaining how to get a local transport for the first timers in the country (ie do we pay the local bus driver directly and does he provide change-the answer is yes).,8.0
1134,I flew from terminal 2 on Friday 13th June on a 7.45am flight to Malaga. This was my first flight with a baby. I had previously checked on Manchester airport website the restrictions on taking babies milk. Based on the advise I took 2 x bottles of made up formula milk. Both bottles were identical however I had one taken away from me. This meant my baby was without milk he required for the journey. The attitude of the security guard was appalling he showed very little concern for my distress or the fact that my baby would not have enough milk to get us to our destination. I travel the world extensively with my job and can safely say I will use LBA and Heathrow going forward.,
1135,The three terminals are some distance from each other particularly terminal 2. Out of about 16 moving walk ways about half were not working on May 27. They were still not working on June 1. This would not be the case in Hong Kong or Shanghai.,4.0
1136,I hope management reads some of these reviews at some point! All I want to say seeing as I agree and have suffered the same fate as 99% of the negative reviews below is we have just managed to book our next trip though Leeds/Bradford airport and if I never see Manchester Airport again I'll still wish I'd never used it in the past! Good riddance and I will do everything I can to avoid at all costs!,
1137,I fly from Manchester twice a year for holidays mostly from terminal 2 have just come back yesterday. Outward bound we had checked in on line and were able to use the baggage drop which was great but then we hit chaos getting through security have never spent so long queuing this was at 6am in the morning on 29th May. Arriving back on 12th June it was a long walk to immigration and the baggage claim and none of the moving walkways were in operation (in fact it is a few years since we have seen them move) my husband has walking difficulties and struggled with the long walk he does not really want to ask for assistance and be put in a wheel chair but this might become the only option. I thought Manchester would have more respect for people who have difficulty walking long distances after sitting down for a few hours on a flight but apparently not. All the improvement are about getting more of your money not helping people to be in dependant.,6.0
1138,Arriving back at terminal 2 we had to queue off the jet bridge to queue in the walkway to queue at the zig-zag barriers to join the queue for Border Security. The E-Passport readers where being upgraded so out of order. 3 people manning the desks 6 or 7 unused! Is this the image we want to give to people wanting to visit or do business in UK?,2.0
1139,"June 4th 2014 arrived at Terminal 1 from Skiathos. Appalling delay at Baggage Reclaim area of 2.5 hours (is this a record?). Not one official person to advise us and no message on Tannoy telling us what the problem was or how long we'd have to wait. Passengers began to think that all baggage handlers had gone home. Thomas Cook desk unattended throughout. Customs desk unattended throughout. Unable to leave room (""No return beyond this point"" outby and ""No entry"" to return to get back to immigration) so unable to find a living soul who could get a message to management or security (passengers were now getting angry). Four other carousels were not being used so the baggage handlers (SWISSPORT) were not busy. Departing from T1 a week earlier 2 hours is not enough time to ensure catching your flight. Appalling shopping mall to navigate (so on principle I won't spend a penny). Passengers are called to departure gate half an hour before they think about opening it (is this part of an airport plan to reduce numbers in main lounge?). I feel sorry for the insufficient staff who are expected to deal with enormous numbers. The whole problem is dreadful management who refuse to employ enough staff.",
1140,Dreadful queues even at 5 am on a Sunday morning and not even school holidays. This problem gets worse year on year for all terminals. Not all the security scanners were being used which lead to long queues. Many people only got through just in time to board their flights so the duty free shops must be losing a lot of business. Although we arrived at least 2 hours before take off as advised we only had 5 minutes before we were called to board. Again long queues on our return to get through passport control. Will try to fly from another airport in the future. Avoid this airport if at all possible is my advice.,
1141,Have used Manchester airport 4 times this year 6 times last year. In my opinion all airport staff in contact with paying customers really really should take regular customer care and service training. And managers need to start taking notice of posted reviews. Staff show arrogant and dismissive attitudes in response to routine enquiries and requests. I agree with a previous reviewer that security staff are abrasive and rude. This is either the result of highly selective hiring criteria or is a cultural problem. Not a good start or end to my holiday experience.,2.0
1142,I normally travel from Manchester a few times a month as it is my local airport. It has quite a lot going for it in that is has good road and rail connections decent parking and a good selection of routes. I must however concur with other reviewers in that as more routes have been added the infrastructure has not been upgraded to take account of this. The area this is most apparent is in security. Over recent months it is not uncommon to experience massive queues and even in some cases out of the door of the airport. The airport says this is due to it being peak season but I travel through a lot of airports where it is also presumably peak season and do not experience this level of queuing. This is especially crazy as I personally now never spend money in the airport shops as I either don't have time or feel in the mood after being stood in a hot airless security queue for a long time. As so much of the airport is given over to retail this means Manchester Airport consistently does not make as much money as it could out of me and I am sure other passengers.,3.0
1143,Travelled to Dubai and Hong Kong - service at these airports are outstanding. Back to Manchester and the service rubbish. Bus driver rude - parking exit assistant rude.,2.0
1144,What a horrible airport especially T1. Travelled a couple of times this year already and every time experienced the same. the only way to get to the check-in area is through the one of the three lifts always queues there. Long queues to the security checks Security staff not very friendly. Dirty toilets. On return very long queues again staff at passport checks can be rude.,
1145,We had an appalling experience on 12th May travelling to Barcelona from this airport queuing from 6.10am until 7.45am - others on the flight did not hear a call to be fast-tracked and therefore stood for even longer. The flight was delayed by 30 mins (and at the other end we unbelievably had to wait for 45 mins for our baggage adding insult to injury). At Manchester there was no concern shown no explanation given no hint of apology - just an impression of chaos and unconcern for the plight of the customers who of course had no chance to eat or buy anything at all. I will go to any lengths to avoid this airport in future.,1.0
1146,Terminal 1. Our destination Corfu meant we had to fly from Manchester. Our transit in both directions was smoother than that of last July because we were travelling out of high season and at quieter times of day. We passed through security quite swiftly and were treated very amicably. The only downside on the outward journey was a longish wait in a hot and stuffy ground floor gate area until we were actually allowed onto the plane. On our return we were among the last off the plane but almost first to passport control because everyone else had taken a wrong turning en route to Arrivals as there seemed to be no signage at a crucial point along the way. The others were just coming back from wherever they had gone when we reached that point. More signs are obviously needed to save passengers from getting lost.,7.0
1147,I hate this airport. Security is stressful and staff can be very rude you feel as if an invisible hand is trying to empty your wallet and the building seems poorly designed.,
1148,Flew in and out of terminal 3 on a domestic flight. On departing total chaos in baggage screening area. Dozens of staff hanging around a few scanners and many more scanners unmanned. Really felt very third world which is almost always my experience at this airport. Utter disgrace.,2.0
1149,What a dreadful airport! At terminal 3 today around 50% of the x-rayed bags in security were passed for hand screening and swabbing causing huge build-ups of frustrated passengers. Many airports recognize that people who've paid money to fly are not criminals per se but Manchester (terminal 3) likes to make everyone passing through get the feeling they are an unreasonable nuisance to mankind. At security the tray containing my jacket and laptop and the tray containing my cabin bag were both sent for manual screening. Incredibly the security chap solemnly looked me in the eye for the second time when it came to tray number two and asked exactly the same questions: did you pack this yourself? Could anyone have interfered? etc. Is it really impossible to add intelligence to security? Airside at Manchester terminal 3 every WHSmith and Boots outlet insists on production of a boarding card for all purchases. Many British airports ask if you object to showing your boarding pass and don't mind if you say 'yes' but Manchester won't sell you even a newspaper without your producing a boarding pass. This farce has gone on long enough. The food outlets don't ask you to show your boarding pass to make a purchase: why should Smiths and Boots? Overall an airport guaranteed to raise blood pressure unless you're one of those submissive types who think the state has a right to know everything you're doing.,
1150,You would think that after building so many shops in the terminals that they would fully man security to get everybody through as soon as possible to do some shopping. Once again 45 minutes to clear security due to only half the desks being manned so no time to shop or even purchase food. What a crazy way to run an airport!,2.0
1151,I use this airport to fly regularly to and from Philadelphia and frankly the 2 airports are a good match in some respects. Appallingly rude lazy and slow security filthy toilets - Philadelphia wins hands down on parking food choices and space since Manchester has turned so much over to retail. This airport really is a terrible reflection on the U.K. and shows it at its slovenly worst.,1.0
1152,Travelled through Terminal 3 - Checked in at 09.05 through Security by 09.15 which compared to many airports especially Heathrow T5 is pretty good. And that wasn't even Fast Track!! Only problem with T3 is the lack of seating!,9.0
1153,T3 delays for passing through security at 0500/0600 hours today took over an hour. They have removed 4 x-ray machines and increased the size of the waiting area in lieu of them! This morning 3 of the remaining 8 x-ray machines were out of service. Massive queues - T3 used to be a breeze - not now - they have added more airlines to the terminal and are continuing to do so (more people passing through - less x-ray machines - more queues and delays - very poor management. Staff are (in security) are also cheesed off due to stressed out passengers. Some at M/cr Airport needs to get a grip and get this sorted - fast.,
1154,Dreadful. Arrived back in the UK (T3) around midnight from EU. Just 4 border officials checking passports complete chaos queues from the passport check right up the hallway harassed people telling people to get in line and stop complaining absolutely disgusting behaviour to non-EU visitors. 40 mins to get back into my own country. If this were my first visit to the UK and Manchester T3 was my first impression I'd never come here again. As it is this isn't the first time I've suffered delays coming back via Manchester and from now on it is the airport of last resort when I fly to the UK. The attitude of the border officials to non-EU travellers made me ashamed to be British.,
1155,My 90 year old grandmother flew from Terminal 3 yesterday and I was left horrified by the attitude of the wheelchair assistance staff. She is a frail tiny lady who was shouted at by two members of staff told to keep her cabin bag on her knee despite it being too heavy for her. Appalling service I will go out of my way to avoid travelling from Manchester airport in the future.,
1156,I travel regularly so I am very familiar with airport security procedures and the need for them. Although they can be irritating and time-consuming I completely understand why they are necessary. That said what I do consider unnecessary is being on the receiving end of rude and abrasive behaviour from security staff. I travelled through Manchester Airport at the weekend and can honestly say I have never had such an unpleasant experience while going through security. The chap at the conveyor belt didn't speak to me - he barked instructions treated me like I was a moron and even got uppity at the way I picked the plastic tray up off the conveyor. Honestly - it was like nothing I've ever experienced before and I hadn't done anything to spark his rudeness. Absolutely disgusting behaviour.,3.0
1157,I travel several times a month out of Manchester both long and short haul. It isn't the worst airport I use - it doesn't bus everyone like Brussels it doesn't make you spend ages changing terminals like Frankfurt it hasn't got the frankly insane organisation of Heathrow's immigration and it isn't as dirty and unpleasant as Liverpool (or have that airport's cringeworthy strapline). I find the staff friendlier than average but there are a couple of serious issues. Terminal 3 immigration is seriously inadequate for the number of flights. If all desks are manned long queues still arise regularly. The Duty Free layout in Terminal 1 is a disgrace and shows a deep seated contempt for the customer as just another object to extract money from. It is clearly designed to disorientate the passenger in the hope that they will wander about the shops and buy something. Nothing like it anywhere else in the hundreds of airports I have visited. The people who man the Meet and Greet service aren't properly trained - they never offer the Fast Track pass if you buy M&G Plus unless you ask. Conversely if you haven't bought it just ask and they will give you one as they clearly haven't got or can't be bothered to check the information as to what you are entitled.,5.0
1158,Appalling. I travel regularly long-haul in business and spend a good deal of money annually going through this third world airport. Dirty and overcrowded. The worst experience is going through security. Staff are unpleasant at best and even downright rude. Fast track is a joke. I am flying to DXB in 2 weeks and I shall have to endure this pathetic airport again.,
1159,I use Manchester airport regularly. Excellent motorway access. Easy to negotiate. Can be fast in and out. Immigration can be a problem with queues but security are the worst queues. The airport really falls down on how it's run. What a terrible advertisement for Manchester. This airport must costs Manchester a lot in bad image you just can't do the job. The place it just plain filthy. It's not cleaned. The car park dear me. The lifts look as though they have never been cleaned. Strange coloured dried up puddles. The whole place needs steam cleaning. Cigarette butts everywhere litter ingrained old dirt on the surfaces everywhere. Is this really the UK? Surely we are in some other country already? The second big problem is the overcrowding at the airport. There's hardly any room for passengers to me met at arrivals: the area has been taken from passengers and given to shops. It's also v congested in departures hard to get in and about little room to wait. The space has been given to shops so little left for passengers. And is this the last airport in the world which requires a coin to be inserted into the trolleys to obtain one? It's a laughable sight to see hordes of people arriving in the customs hall to collect their luggage and go to get a trolley. Of course they need to change money first. Its a pound coin! Better than going through Heathrow though. Idea: why not get Changi Aiport to run it.,4.0
1160,Very bad service at this airport. Travelling to and from airport on Turkish Airlines. Staff rude and unhelpful. Used to enjoy sitting in cafe overlooking the airfield now not accessible unless travelling. Poor service overall. Disappointing.,
1161,Flew out of terminal three 08/03/14 at 2200. Security staff excellent friendly and efficient. I found the terminal spotless. Good range of shops airside however as we were the last flight out there was no hot food available. I can appreciate that it is not worth doing hot food due to lack of traffic so I was not too perturbed by this. Had flown into Terminal one earlier in the day and again found terminal spotless. Furthermore the rail service from the airport is excellent. Tip for passengers don't queue for rail tickets use the automatic machines they are great. Overall a very pleasant airport experience.,10.0
1162,Flying to Dublin through Manchester T1. I cannot understand the layout of this airport. It seems to be designed as a shopping centre with an airport afterthought add on. The first time I went through there I had a quick look around the shops and had some food in the only place to eat. When I went to go the gate I discovered that there was another area full of shops and restaurants once you walked (or I should say meandered aimlessly) through a shop/unsignposted cash extraction area. No idea what was past the first part of the mystery tour. Self guided tour. Signposting is poor. They should provide some signs to show you where they are cleverly hidden.. must be a design feature to ensure they don't upset the feng shui or obscure the shop signage. The gate signs are really cleverly hidden behind the low ceiling beams. And did you know in Manchester it's 12354 just in case you've figured out where the signs are hidden they have another trick of swapping 5 and 4 to really add a final twist to the mystery tour. Altogether a great experience for free. Almost. Unless you get caught in shops and have to buy something so you can ask someone the way out.,5.0
1163,We use Manchester airport fairly frequently but haven't experience British Airways check in at T3 for a while. To call it shambolic would be kind. We arrived at 7.20 for a 9.50 take-off having checked in online. The bag drop line was so long that 40 minutes later we were half way through. This line was serviced by 2 and at times 1 desk clerk. Having tried to complain that we were in danger of missing flights and connections the only other person around suggested that we should write to BA to complain as this happens all the time and they never have enough staff. We finally had to take matters into our own hands and jump the queue (thanks to other understanding passengers) and run through security to get to the gate as it was boarding! Given the choice we will not fly BA again from Manchester and would urge others to do the same until BA does something about the abysmal staffing situation. By the way if you're travelling First Class they have 2 desk clerks waiting to check you in! BA clearly only cares about the big spenders!,4.0
1164,Travelled through Manchester Airport Terminal 3 on 14 February 2014 and I have to say how thoroughly disappointed I was with the place. Instead of getting better over the years t has got progressively worse. From unnecessarily long queues at security presumably from poor resource management to the claustrophobic atmosphere in the T3 departure area. The airport group have squeezed so many retail outlets into the place that you can hardly see any daylight and there is insufficient room to feel comfortable. At the gate 141 waiting area I counted a mere 20 seats which is pathetic when you consider the Airbus on which I was travelling has a capacity of about 160! Some of the 'seats' in the waiting area were nothing more than park benches. Uncomfortable and totally out of place in an airport. Not a customer friendly experience at all and heaven knows what it must be like if there are any delays. Anyone travelling through T3 will know how a sardine feels when they use it. The signage around the place is also poor. The font size is large and its like something you would see in a kids nursery. An all round poor experience which I don't want to have to repeat in a hurry.,1.0
1165,A year ago I could find nothing good to say about Manchester and was very reluctant to fly from there. This however was my third trip in a row from MAN and again I was very surprised at the changes in attitude and efficiency particularly with the security staff and queuing.,10.0
1166,Arrived from Paris at Terminal 3. Landed at 07.45am so queuing times at immigration were short. Luggage delivered within 15 mins. Upon departure check-in was hassle-free - using self-service machines and baggage drop. Airport let down by intrusive security check and very surly staff. I was barked at for not taking my shoes off then had to undergo the body scanner and an additional patdown! Boarding areas provide ample seating and clean lavatories.,8.0
1167,Flew in from Belfast arrived at T3 straight through with no queues or distractions. Will admit that the walk from T3 to the train station is a bit of a pain still once you get there it's only twenty minutes into the city centre. A very good regional hub in my opinion miles better than Liverpool for example and a lot more functional and modern than certain other provincial airports in the UK. Only thing lacking is a decent bar air/land side Wetherspoons take note!,8.0
1168,9th December travelling to Helsinki via Amsterdam from Terminal 3. Arrived over 2 hours before the flight at 09.20 with the intention of picking up some presents to people at the airport. Between the queues for the KLM/Air France bag drop and the endless waiting in Terminal 3 security by the time I had cleared security I had 5 minutes to pick up a coffee and then the gate was opened. Therefore no shopping for me and no additional revenue for Manchester Airport so Schipol got my business. The Terminal 3 security is perpetually slow and is simply unable to cope with demand especially when the two American Airlines morning flights passengers are going through security. This has recently been upgraded but seems worse to me now. On the positive side on my return immigration was quick and bags were delivered swiftly as well.,3.0
1169,In the past I have been very critical of Manchester but for the third time this year the airport has exceeded my expectations. Outbound on 05 December and inbound on 12th was a pleasure. Very short queues and polite staff on security. We were airside in under 5 minutes from having dropped our bags. On return we were through immigration in less than five minutes. Only criticism was baggage reclaim. A few bags came through within a couple of minutes of our arrival but then nothing more for almost half an hour.,8.0
1170,Long queues very unfriendly staff especially at security. Almost missed my flights despite arriving well ahead. Very unorganized. Would rather spend more time travelling than flying via Manchester again.,1.0
1171,T1 to MLA with Easyjet. Sadly I have to concur with many of the comments below. On departure: no queue or problems at bag drop but I almost missed my flight due to enormous queues for security - there must have been the equivalent of two A380s in front of me and moving slowly. I was planning on having breakfast in the terminal (MAN management take note: this is loss of income) but there was no chance - just time for a mad rush to the gate with only enough spare time to buy a drink. No issues with Easyjet ground staff however. On return: 15-20 minute queue for immigration but no issues with staff at passport control. 10 more minutes waiting for bags. It's becoming apparent that MAN is following the example of LHR and is doing a very good job of it - while passenger numbers have hardly rocketed in the past few years staff cuts are clearly taking their toll. We should be proud to call this our home airport - the gateway to a great region - but there's no chance of that at the moment I'm afraid!,2.0
1172,Travelling Manchester to Belfast recently I had the most horrendous experience I have ever had passing through 'Security' - The baggage check was fine and the staff were reasonably civil but when I got to where you scan your boarding pass and look into something (is it a camera?) all hell broke loose. An extremely rude aggressive female member of staff started shouting at me because I couldn't get the scanner to work and didn't know that I was supposed to look into the camera. When I told her not to be so rude she stormed off and luckily a more civil male official took over and let me look into a hand held 'camera' instead otherwise I might still be standing there.,
1173,Manchester airport must be the most passenger unfriendly airport in the UK. I arrived happy and fresh from a great holiday in Mallorca at 1.20pm Sat 28th Sep. 45mins frustrating queuing at passport control for EU passengers. Trying to extract a trolley from the useless and money grabbing Trolley Pay Station-lost 3 pounds and hurt my arthritic hand. Longer wait at Carousel 5 waiting for a suitcase that I eventually found out was still at Palma airport. I left the airport some 4 hrs later feeling shattered. All airport staff should be given a much needed course learning that passengers are human who should be treated with respect.,1.0
1174,Flew from Terminal 1 on 27th September. Was checked in by 5am and security was chaos with people spilling out of the security area into the check-in area due to weight of numbers. After a long wait in a windowless hot environment finally got through however not a pleasant experience at all. Manchester is my local airport and I fly from here several times a month. In recent months Terminal 1 and Terminal 3 security has become a nightmare and I am beginning to dread this every time I fly. Unfortunately however Liverpool does not offer a lot of routes so I am very muck stuck with using Manchester. Particularly in Terminal 1 considerable investment has been made in extra retail space but I never use it due to time and also not being in a shopping mood after the security experience and I imagine retailers are suffering as a result.,3.0
1175,I have been scathing about Manchester in the past and was loath to use this airport after the last few times but found myself booked on three trips this year. This was the first and I have to say it was an eye opener. My dislike of MAN is based on several trips where staff and facilities have been woefully short of the minimum you would expect. This last trip was a welcome exception. The fast track was operating well and the staff at screening were courteous and efficient (a first for me at MAN) and we were through in a few minutes. On my last return through MAN we were held on a corridor for over an hour with no explanation and then faced with surly immigration staff and long long waits for luggage to get onto the belt. To my immense relief the organisation was far better on this trip. The queues for immigration were relatively short and by using the automated booths were through in less than ten minutes. They do need more of these booths though and to keep them in working order. Baggage was on the belt within ten minutes of us reaching it and we were off the plane and out of the airport in a little under 30 minutes all told. A much better experience. I can only hope this is norm now and not a lucky hit.,7.0
1176,Flew out on 7th September. Arrived at 5.15 for 7.35 departure. Took more than an hour to check-in and then joined horrendous queue at security. Had to be pulled out of queue in order to make our flight. Does anyone have time to shop in duty-free? We certainly didn't. Coming back was less stressful. Large queues at passport control but at least kept moving. However a very long walk from aircraft to baggage reclaim especially for parents who had young children to carry.,1.0
1177,Flew from T1 on 13 September 2013 to Pisa. Huge queues at check in and security. Returned on 17th September to be met by huge queues again at security. Not surprisingly the duty free shop was well staffed and laid out but I did not have time to shop there!! The airport management need to spend more on security facilities and less on revenue generation. I will avoid Manchester in future.,
1178,Terminal 1 - arrived 05.15 for 07.30 departure . Carry on bag only. Already checked in on line. Queue for security stretched right through terminal to outside drop off zone. Processing very slow barely made my flight along with many others. Retail obstacle course really aggravating and of course pointless after all the delay. Having read previous reviews it appears something is basically wrong here.,
1179,Flying back to Southampton experienced appalling shambles at security. Gigantic and slow moving queues in the middle of a weekday afternoon. Apparently there are 'improvements' afoot but there is no excuse for this disgraceful third world scene. Shame on the management.,2.0
1180,I am a frequent flyer and pass through Manchester at least once every month on business. Unfortunately I depart/arrive via Terminal 3. Departure has been a nightmare for many months now and the fast track takes longer than the normal queue. Staff simply do not care (or there is no one on duty) and people move freely between the normal queue and fast track. I departed there on Tuesday 3rd Sep and it was just the same. Arrivals is even worse as quite often you arrive at the same time as other flights and the queues for immigration are horrendous. On Friday 7th June I arrived on a flight and we disembarked at the far NE end of Terminal 3 to be immediately met with a queue that stretched as far as the eye could see (I photographed the queue being careful to capture the '2010 travel awards winner' proudly displayed on the wall) (for those of you that don't know the terminal the immigration control is in the centre). Unfortunately there was also a queue from the far SE end of the terminal and they had precedent over our side so we had to walk from the NE end of the terminal to the SE end and then join the end of that queue. There must have been four flights queuing. There was one immigration officer dedicated to Foreigners and max 3 for UK nationals. It took one hour to pass and I'd been travelling for 24hrs already that day. I came through again in July and August and had a similar but not quite as bad experience having to wait only 15 and 20 minutes respectively. The terminal is simply not up to the task of handling the volume it passes through. There are no automated 'chipped passport' scanners. Then once you get through immigration you have an equally frustrating wait at baggage handling. I wrote this review because the issues are long standing and show no sign of improving. I'm looking at either changing carrier or airport as Liverpool is only a few miles further away. So be warned if you plan to use this terminal. On the plus side when I go on holiday it is usually via terminal 1 and there I have no problems.,
1181,Terminal 1. Tried to check in for a flight leaving at 7.10am on 31/08/13. The queues went through the terminal and out through the door. Because of delays in security an airport employee patrolled the Fast Lane calling out flight times to take people out of the queue into the Fast Lane. This is not efficient as the estimated time to get through security has been seriously underestimated by the employee. When we finally got through security we were refused embarkation at the departure gate as this had closed. There are four basic problems at Terminal 1: 1) Too many early morning flights. 2) Security is understaffed and extremely inefficient. 3) Because of high aircraft charges for checked in bags more hand luggage is having to be checked in. 4) When you finally manage to clear Security you then have to fight your way through the Duty Free area to try and get to the departure gates in time.,
1182,Terminal two at Manchester airport on 5th Aug 2013. We had a flight to Dalaman and we were checked in very quickly by the check-in staff who were smartly dressed and very polite. Went up to the security area to be held up for all of 5 mins which for Manchester was extremely good. We passed through with no hassle at all and was even told by staff to have a good flight/holiday which again we found very good for Manchester (which is not the norm). We found our gate after going through dutyfree shop. At 9.35am the plane pulled onto the stand (214) and we had to wait for all the passengers/baggage to be taken off before we could board at 10am we started to board our Onur Air flight to Dalaman we were all on by 10.15am and we pushed back. We will be flying out of T2 MAN again in the future.,8.0
1183,Arrived back in Manchester T2 approx 10pm on 20/8 from Greece. As has been the case on every single arrival at this airport in recent years the wait to pass through immigration was ridiculous. On this occasion we waited almost an hour. We were European nationals arriving in a European country from another European country. I was embarrassed to once again witness this at my home airport. The first impression that non UK passengers must receive of Manchester doesn't bear thinking about. Given the amount of passengers arriving on the evening in question I could not see any grounds to keep people (many with very young children) waiting for this length of time. A shambles.,
1184,"MAN is my local airport and I use it somewhere between 15 and 20 times a year - usually ""off season"" and for early morning flights and normally it's a joy to use - the new security arrangements in T1 and T2 particularly are excellent and from bag drop to end of security can take as little as 10 minutes. However the current security debacle in T3 is abysmal - on a recent short haul flight to Europe I arrived as I usually do 90 minutes before departure time and after baggage drop off I immediately found myself in an incredibly long security line that snaked around the building as far as the eye could see - asking a security guard how long it would take to clear he shrugged and responded ""about an hour"". I asked why it was so bad and he replied that they were down to two scanners due to refurbishment and it was the busiest time of year. You really do have to question why they have chosen to do this refurbishment at the busiest time of year when it would clearly cause maximum disruption. All the way through the awfully long and hot wait a lady was calling through passengers who were departing in less than 30 minutes (so it pays to be late clearly!) and a sense of barely controlled chaos pervaded the whole thing. When finally getting through the lines there wasn't time for any refreshments etc just a brisk walk to the gate and immediate boarding was all that time allowed - am surprised the retailers in T3 are not up in arms at the current state of the place! Such a shame Manchester Airport is normally a wonderful place to start a trip but the current state of T3 leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Thank goodness my next flight is out of T2.",5.0
1185,Terminal 3. I've used this terminal regularly over the last few months and can't wait for a break from it. The queues start at the entrance to security and from there it's all misery until on the flight. To provide an excuse the management have put up apologetic signs. But they've been there for months now so the excuse has worn paper thin. There are only three x-ray machines in use leading to an unpleasant and painful (for people with niggling injuries like me) lengthy standing session in an area with the atmosphere of a hospital waiting room. This seems unnecessary when there are other machines nearby that are little used and many staff standing around with nothing to do. Staff are offhand or surly and seem to have no sympathy to their customers' discomfort. The shops are OK but there's rarely time to part with any money. To the officious member of staff I grumbled to...no I can't arrive earlier than when the first train of the day drops me off! And why do you have to scan your boarding card twice (with inevitable queuing each time): is that meant to be an improvement?,2.0
1186,"Simply the worst airport I've had the misfortune of visiting. Actually missed my flight for the first time in my life! Got to the airport 2 hours before my flight (6am) with no bags to check which from experience is plentiful for most normal airports. However at Manchester I was greeted by the mother of all airport security queues. Having shuffled along for 1.5 hrs I could see time was getting tight. Thankfully a member of staff shouted ""anyone with a flight in the next 30 min please come forward"" which I gladly did. Whereas most airports suffice with a full body metal detector Manchester insists on using a ridiculous body scanner. You have to queue to enter the scanner then after you exit you get scanned again! In all it took me 25 min to get through the body scanner leaving me 5 min to run to the boarding gate. Got there 5 min late - the gate had closed. What's the point of fast-tracking people 30 min before their flight when it takes 25 min to pass through security? And why use body scanners that serve no purpose other than to cause you grief and misery? The whole operation is a shambles.",
1187,17/8/2013 MAN-MUN 6.55am Lufthansa. Arrived at around 5am. Airport extremely over crowded! Checked-in online with no baggage so went straight through to security. But unfortunately only got as far as the boarding pass scanner to enter the airside zone. Apparently the barcode on my boarding pass was not the right kind of ink. I had to go all the way back to the check in desk pointlessly just to get an airport boarding pass. Whilst time was ticking had to join the first queue which started practically from drop off then the second queue which was for security. Now there is really no security at Manchester airport all the rude insolent staff just tell you where to stand. A loud beep came out of the gate signalling I had to stand in a claustrophobic box for 15 minutes with 7 other people just so they could pat me down. Had to run straight to the gate which was 08 and was about a good 15 minute walk from security. When I arrived the sign said 'boarding' so hopped into the queue. But queued for about 25 minuets before I could even board the plane. Don't even get me started with arrivals that's worse than a zoo! No wonder the airlines say come at least 2 hours before your boarding time!,1.0
1188,Terminal 1. Lufthansa to Munich at 06.55. 16th July. Already checked in online and as I had hand luggage only I went straight to security at 05.30. Lots of people about mostly people going on holiday. The queue kept moving I didn't have to stop and standstill and overall it went smoothly. Airside - The one thing I hate about this terminal is having to walk through the duty free shops to get to the gate area. Its like walking through a department store and is not conducive to efficient passenger transit from A to B. A new restaurant upstairs that has replaced the self service one. The service was fast as required by departing passengers. Return arrival next day at 22.30. Guess what? Automatic E passport gates not operating (again)! Fortunately there was no queue for manual passport inspection. Didn't have to wait for baggage so I was out of the airport in quick time. One of the better experiences.,8.0
1189,"Terminal 1. We used to fly via Manchester quite often but in recent years we have invariably used Liverpool. However I had found it cost slightly less to fly from Manchester so we went for the cheaper option. Everything went fairly smoothly both on the outward and inward journey and we encountered no unpleasantness from anyone: in fact the security lady who attended to us was positively pleasant and helpful. She even suggested that my wife and I share a tray for the items which had to be sent through separately. Would we choose Manchester in future over Liverpool? Only if it was much cheaper. Everything took much longer at Manchester because of the crowds. Security area seemed more claustrophobic and there was hardly any room on the other side of the channels to re- pack one's bags. On our return it took approximately an hour from leaving the plane until we exited the car park. There weren't any major queues at any stage but long walks passage through passport control waiting for the bus to Jet Park 3 roadworks between the airport and the car park all took time even without hold luggage to collect In contrast our daughter who had flown later via Liverpool said that on return it took her just 5 minutes from plane to car park. She agreed that everything had been in her favour but in the past we have managed it in 15 minutes when immigration is not busy. Also why is a boarding pass required even to buy a newspaper at Manchester when there is no such requirement at Liverpool? On balance therefore Manchester was better than we expected but the sheer volume of people passing through would make us choose the possibly more downmarket but ""homelier"" Liverpool on most occasions.",5.0
1190,This airport is an unpleasant one from which to depart. Security is nonsensical and un-necessarily neurotic. It seems that the MAG management have as their number 1 priority the inconvenience of the passengers. Why is it that when they go from bad to improved someone dreams up something new to create queues and take the airport back down to very poor? Their latest gimmick is a new (and very expensive) system to photograph every passenger going into the departure lounge and then repeat the process as they leave! They state: All these security precautions are absolutely necessary to ensure the safety of all passengers so co-operation with security searches will be appreciated by the Airport staff. The passengers are put upon as a result of poor and incompetent management.,1.0
1191,Arrived early hours of the morning tired and looking forward to my holiday. To me the airport is where it starts? Sadly this is not the Airport to start your Holiday. This was my first visit to Manchester airport and hopefully my last. The good parts - it was clean! Then you hit security now we all know it has to be done but this lot were the worst I have come across. Rude obstinate are just the nice words I can think of. By the time we got through we then had to rush to get in time for our check in time this gave us no time for a Break or look at duty free. So on the whole avoid if you can.,
1192,Large queues seem to be a given at Manchester airport nowadays it is no longer my departure point of choice but unfortunately on occasion I still have to use it. Last week we experienced a 20 minute delay when we arrived to wait for Wheel Chocks to be positioned before we could leave the plane and then 1 hour 30 minutes waiting for the luggage to arrive? Over 2 hours from touching down on the runway to exiting the building. Very poor service management and staff I am afraid.,1.0
1193,Flew from Manchester airport on 17th June 2013 and were met with massive queues at check in and security only just made it for our flight after queuing for over 2.5 hours. No time for a coffee or browsing round the shops very stressful.,
1194,"MAN is my local airport - unfortunately. I've had so many bad experiences there that it is difficult to recount. Flew back from Palma on Saturday afternoon 2 weeks ago and had to wait 2 hours for baggage which then came through on a different carousel than the one posted on the arrivals board. Appalling customer service total indifference to their paying customers and an all too familiar ""take it or leave it"" attitude. The explanation for the 2 hour baggage reclaim was ""there were a lot of flights all arriving close together"". This was late May and therefore out of high season. Dreadful officious passport control staff. People with non-British passports were processed much quicker than actual British residents. An appallingly sub-standard airport with many lessons to learn that continue to go unheeded.",2.0
1195,Flying from Heathrow is already a bad idea. Manchester Airport is not any different. I was flying with Emirates and workers all the way from the check-in counter to security and boarding were all rude and impatient. Sadly none of them showed any level of professionalism in their speech and were all very arrogant. I have to admit that this is probably one of the most basic airport that I have ever used. The airport is obviously too small to accommodate all passengers. Very big disappointment indeed!,1.0
1196,"I see that the staff are impatient rude and generally unhelpful by an awful lot of posts. It is assumed the posters do not see themselves that way yet I would suggest that it is the case. I shall be flying long haul again in October but then I plan ahead and generally have little difficulty at any airport. If I have a ""problem"" my experience has been to just have polite word and amazingly something happens. I have never had a problem at Manchester except for some mistaken train information which was quickly apologised for and quickly resolved.",9.0
1197,Had no problems at the airport apart from security at departure. My 75 year old husband was given a pat down security search and asked what he was wearing around his waist. On being told it was a hidden money belt the very officious young man demanded that this be removed. To do this my husband had to undo his trousers in front of a crowd of people. I also saw another elderly man having to do the same. Surely a bit of respect would not come amiss. On the other hand the young lady on passport control upon landing couldn't have been more pleasant.,5.0
1198,Trying to board a domestic flight today was a nightmare. I must have scanned my boarding pass about 6-8 times. The new photo recognition equipment wasn't working. I joined a queue out of the departure lounge for the boarding gates and as I neared another check point I switched queues only to be told when I got to the front that I had to rejoin the queue (at the back) I'd just left as this queue was only for those that couldn't get through the automated scanning point - how was I to know? Impatient rude stressed security staff didn't help the situation. Hopeless.,
1199,Travelling to Thailand from Manchester T2 after check-in we were told to go straight to the fast track security queue as we had 1 hour before take off. Got to the fast track line and was told to join the main line even though we had given our take off time. Joined the line which was queuing out of T2 and up the stairs approx 600 people in the queue got to 20 minutes before take off and there was no way we were going to make it through security in time a staff member shouting out to come forward if your are due to take off in the next 30 minutes. So we were fast tracked through. It was a very unpleasant experience and we had only got to the security line. The flight was fine just the security line needs sorting.,
1200,"Terminal 3. The main problem is with airport security. Arrived at airport 90 minutes before departure (even though you can check in luggage up to 40 minutes before departure). Big queues for depositing baggage. The new airport body scanners seem totally unnecessary and simply slow down the procedure. What they had before was perfectly adequate. My hand luggage was ""queried"" because a swimming mask and snorkel showed up as potentially a ""blade and some piping"". Can't the scanners tell metal from plastic? The contents of the whole bag had to be searched by hand and put through the scanners again. Meanwhile my jacket wallet passport etc. had gone down a different channel and was at risk of being taken while my bag was being ""examined"". By the time we were through this process the flight was on ""last call"" and had only 15 minutes before departure. So much for refreshments and shopping before boarding. As others have said the lack of sufficient staff is the principal reason for this inefficiency. Getting through the security gates in itself took over 30 minutes. It's not a pleasant experience when you're starting your holiday.",
1201,Terminal 1 - Would never use this airport again. - long queues backed up at security gates. I stayed at an on- airport hotel and arrived at the terminal 2.5 hrs before my flight. I had to demand to be fast tracked and then still had to run to the gate and almost missed the flight. Then the plane was delayed because the bags for the people who missed the flight had to be removed! They are simply not geared up to handle the number of people they have to process and need to urgently consider cutting the number of flights leaving the airport from this terminal. The security gates just can not process people quick enough. For Arrivals the design of the terminal is appalling. Off the plane at ground level immediately have to walk upstairs only to have to come down again a few yards later then upstairs again before finally back down again to retrieve luggage. There were people on my plane with walking difficulties and there were no escalators or moving walkways available to them.,
1202,The lines for the security check were huge I was lucky they called 2-3 flights that they calculated that if they did not take to the fast lane would lose the flight. So even with the fast line it was too long and the bag takes 8-10 min it almost had nothing inside and 2 separate lines go to one to get each and every one again checked and body search and shoe removal and they wait for everyone to take their shoes which can take a century for some. They could at least make everyone take off their shoes from the beginning and not waste time. I ended up running to go to the gate after you go through all the shops. Very stressful. It is the individual checks that lack personnel.,1.0
1203,"Several recent domestic flights from T3 to/from LHR mostly with BA one with Virgin Atlantic. My experience is as always with this airport variable. Most of the time it's good so I still recommend it. While the dreadful design of this terminal cannot be quickly improved I see no reason why they can't improve cleanliness or facilities. Flights are often delayed even at quiet times and the security experience is so variable that it's beyond a joke now. While I have always been well-treated by MAN's security it's the haphazard way the rules are applied which is so annoying. On my most recent flight half the queue went through a ""standard"" check while the other half were subjected to the full-body scanner a separate shoe scanner a full-body pat-down and a full head-to-toe hand-held scan. While several major airports around the world have now given up on such over-zealous screening I'm beginning to wonder just what MAN knows about security risks which the rest don't? Either everyone should be subject to such intensive scanning or no-one at all. This took much longer than the bag scan did - which meant that our bags were sitting unsupervised on an adjacent belt for quite a few minutes. Not impressed at all.",2.0
1204,I flew into and out of T3 during the Easter holiday weekend. Even though it's the newest of MAN's three terminals it clearly wasn't designed for the current levels of passenger throughput: huge queues snaking back from passport control on arrival and only two out of six desks were manned. Obviously this is a Border Agency issue but as most flights at this terminal operate to/from EU countries - and the same scenario is replicated at airports across the UK - surely it would make sense for the British government to finally join the European majority and sign the Schengen agreement?,6.0
1205,"Review refers to T3. Arrived on Monday noon by flybe from DUS without luggage. Arrival ok. 15 min by feet to train station. Flew back to DUS (again without luggage) on Tuesday flight departure time 5.45pm. I arrived at train station at 4.15 at T3 at 4.30 having checked-in online before. I thought I was early arriving 75 minutes before departure. But the security queue was horrible it took 40 minutes to get through. Simply not enough open lanes for the quantity of people. In the end after buying a coffee I arrived at gate just in time for boarding. (Only other airport I know where it takes so long is Moscow DME). One lady was constantly going around and asking for people whose flight would depart soon so that they could get through without queuing. (So late arrivers could ""cheat"" early arrivers had to queue). Apparently they are trying to keep operating costs low by having too few staff.",3.0
1206,Out from T3 on 22nd March 10 minutes through Security which these days I think is pretty good especially compared to Heathrow. Terminal nice and clean and sufficient eating or drinking outlets. Only downside a lack of seating which seems to have been sacrificed for shops!! On return bags on carousel very quickly.,10.0
1207,From T1 for an easyJet flight to Tenerife. Used their Meet and Greet parking service which is remarkable value for money. Dropped the car off and left the key with the staff and it was waiting on our return all for £39.99 for 7 days. Flight left at 0700 and the passage through security was painless with plenty of staff and a minimum of delays. Not a great deal of choice if you want to eat before boarding. Tortuous route to the gates through the shops like too many airports they seem to consider they are a shopping mall which lets planes park outside. On return we left the plane to find ourselves walking through very narrow corridors and up steep and narrow flights of steps to get to immigration. Immigration well staffed and no queues. I tried the electronic passport scanning gates while my wife went to the conventional desks. She was through 3 times quicker than I was they are going to have to do something about the electronic system if people are going to be persuaded to use it. Interminable time for the machine to scan your passport then having to stand motionless in front of a camera while it compares the images. Not good. Baggage arrived reasonably quickly and we were out in good time. Manchester is my nearest international airport and if I can avoid a trip down to Gatwick or Heathrow I will but T1 needs some attention to improve the flow of passengers through the building.,5.0
1208,Appalling queues for Security checks Terminal 1. Forget any intention of doing Duty Free shopping or getting a breakfast. We ended up running to the Gate although we had arrived at the Airport 2.5 hours before departure time. Aircraft was boarding when we got to the gate hungry and stressed out. It was even worse when we flew out of Manchester Terminal 1 in December 2012. Arriving in Tenerife a couple told us they came through Terminal 1 on the Friday and the queue for security was out of the terminal doors and people were forced to queue outside in Minus 4 temperature. Surely they know how many flights are due to depart and when. Arriving home was no better. Long delays getting our Baggage at Carousel 7 at 7pm on 19 March 2013.,
1209,Very long wait at security very nearly missed my flight bad attitude of staff. Had my bag searched but again attitude of woman searching was poor and because I was made to put my belongings in two trays I had to search amongst the trays that were piled up to find the rest which worried me as anyone could have pinched my passport money etc. I felt very degraded - they need to learn people skills.,1.0
1210,Flew into and out of terminal one in the last two weeks. Overall I think it's the best of Manchester's 3 terminals due to it's proximity and easy access to the airport station and it's more thoughtful and user friendly design: there seems to be sufficient check in security and baggage reclaim facilities for the number of aircraft and passengers it can handle at peak times consequently queuing is kept to a minimum. Staff are friendly and efficient and there's plenty of seating and a reasonable range of places to have a drink or something to eat in the departure lounge. Drawbacks: the forced torturous route to the departure lounge through the duty free shopping area and the weird way in which the piers are configured leading to arriving passengers having to go down a long flight of stairs - not an escalator - then immediately back up a similarly long flight to the same level.,8.0
1211,From the States I prefer to clear immigration at Manchester rather than at my other choice Heathrow. The main reason is because the immigration officials at Manchester have been-so far-quite professional and better yet unbelievably civil and friendly. They beat out not only Heathrow officials but Newcastle and from what I read even John Lennon's. Heathrow officials either seem to be the old school dragons of the past who delight in interrogating foreigners or the new type of lazy unprofessional types who care only about their coffee breaks. Though I would rate the T3 departures lounge at Manchester as being fair in comparison to Heathrow's T5 which is far nicer I'd still put up with T3 just for the immigration officials. Security is relatively quick and painless though it seems as though in November 2012 they were doing some sort of audit and many 'random' passengers were selected for shoe and body scans. Those were ok except if one were in a hurry to catch one's flight it was time to panic. Also one's baggage went through a separate line to be scanned oftentimes being scanned quicker than its owners' shoes and bodies because the latter's officials just took forever and worse had 4 of them to scan one passenger (why who knows). Thus keeping track of one's baggage was a lesson in patience and agility.,8.0
1212,I think Manchester is ideally located for travel to many parts of north and central England however I have always had to use T3 for the route I wanted to fly and found the departures concourse to be very cramped and crowded even having to negotiate queues at boarding gates just to use the toilets! Last week however I flew for the first time from T1. This was a much better experience spacious bright clean and not crowded at all! Queues at security differed enormously too. When we landed early and had to pass a few hours before getting a train T1 arrivals had plenty on offer. Flying out from T1 we were delayed due to bad weather but I found T1 departures a very pleasant environment to be stuck in! It would be unusual to select a particular airline on the basis of which terminal it uses in a large airport but I believe that in future if I need to fly to/from Manchester I'll only use airlines that fly in and out of T1!,8.0
1213,Manchester used to be one of the best airports to collect your hire car with the collection point on top of the multi-storey car park. Now they have a car hire a 5 minute drive away. Waiting for the bus is a pain. You then have to lug your bags onto the bus with little room the cars are all outside and at night it is badly lit. Manchester for me is now on a par with Luton for car hire collection.,5.0
1214,Travelled through Manchester Airport with family arriving Sunday morning and departing in the evening. There were no delays although having the car rental village away from the terminal does increase the time needed to collect and drop off the vehicle. On our return we queued for the security check about half an hour. My son had gone through earlier paying for the swift transit and managed to keep his bottle of coke. He was happy about that but it does show it is just a money gathering exercise. We were unfortunately delayed by our airline and the only place eventually open for a hot drink in Terminal 1 was Real Food which had undrinkable coffee.,8.0
1215,Arriving from Dubai terminal one meant a long walk down a portakabin style corridor. You pay one pound non refundable for a trolley. Very narrow exit doors for luggage. To reach hire cars village meant journey across cluttered pavement to bus stop. 10 minute wait for bus with limited luggage racks. Also means ditching said one pound trolley. Hire car village some 5 minutes bus drive away. All cars unsheltered and road signing for newcomers to find exit to a specific town is awful. Manchester is a poor airport that just seems set to make money from shopping and add bits and pieces of terminals without view of big picture.,2.0
1216,Terminal facilities are ok sometimes a bit confusing and relatively long walks. However short walk to (good organized) car rental centre. Good accessibility by car and rail (short ride to city centre and good cross- country services to the North). Quite a long distance to the draughty rail station the signposting could be optimized.,5.0
1217,Most recent experience at T3 (MAN-LHR) was alright except for the security procedures of 'randomly' selecting passengers for a body scan and a shoe inspection. There are two separate lines that are separated by a glass wall. The first line one surrenders one's items (hand luggage jackets computers etc.) as usual for the x-ray scan. Then if one is unlucky one is instructed to step to the side to another line with a turnstile that turns green when it's okay to proceed to the body scan. Very slow official will then have you surrender your shoes to be x-rayed! And worse as in my experience there are 3 other officials to check one passenger. All the while the queue is growing and growing with other 'randomly' selected passengers. Worse is that one can see while waiting in that long queue through the glass wall in the first line that one's hand luggage and other items have already been scanned and are just waiting in the tray idling. If they are going to search people make sure that they have not 4 officials to do so but one and to speed it up. Otherwise T3 is a bit strange as once all of the craziness of the security checks are over one walks down a very long corridor to meet up with the departures lounge that doubles as shopping/eating areas. I just cannot understand UK security practices these days. I had hoped that Manchester would have been better than Heathrow. In general UK security checks make Paris CDG seem like a paradise as CDG used to years ago have similar security checks but have since stopped the unnecessary busy work sort of ridiculous harassing 'checks'.,3.0
1218,Manchester airport is excellent. All 3 terminals are clean well laid out and they all have good shopping and eating facilities. The airport has been re-done. Manchester has good connections with 3 flights a day to Dubai including the A380 10 flights a week to Doha 1 a day to Singapore and other flights to New York Atlanta Washington DC Las Vegas Islamabad and Philadelphia!,9.0
1219,Queuing for Boarding Pass plus Security - 2 hours. Completely unacceptable. People were being called out of the queue so they could sprint for their flights. Insufficient numbers of security staff.,2.0
1220,Overzealous security (although nice). Everything but a strip search on a flight between EU countries. Queues you wont believe as a result. After security you had to walk through a mall to get to gate. Extremely stressful! Up and down stairs to get to the correct gate. Does not fulfil the basic requirements of a traveller; maybe get something to eat or drink and get to the aircraft in an effective way.,
1221,In the last 3 weeks Terminal 3 security screening queues have been horrendous right out to the corridor. On one occasion asked why the problem and was informed new rota starting should sort it out then the next time same queues again and asked was told people sick surely they have on call staff for illness at airports? Anyhow I got there at 06.50am for a 07.55 flight and just about made it no luggage etc. But now I am having to buy fast track as I do not trust what is happening there however I feel it is a management change not sickness etc.,4.0
1222,When travelling from Manchester via Heathrow to Singapore then onto Brisbane I expected to receive all of my boarding passes. I checked in at Terminal 3 at the British Airways desk and only received the pass to Heathrow when I questioned this the check in lady said in a very unhelpful attitude to get my passes at Heathrow Qantas desk. This was new to me as I had done this journey twice before I know procedures change but someone more helpful would have been nice especially when I met 2 other people on the same flight who had received their onward boarding passes. When my flight was then delayed by 50 minutes I was getting worried especially as not one person at Heathrow could help. Arrived at Manchester at 4 pm and only just made my flight from Heathrow at 11 pm!,5.0
1223,Arrived at terminal 1 after a flight from Vancouver. We had to negotiate flights of stairs and dingy corridors no travelators or escalators here. Ok for some but many elderly people were struggling. Immigration was fairly quick tho then the fun started in very busy baggage claim area many people needed trolleys you need a pound to get one its finding or pleading with someone who has one thats the problem. Having left the baggage hall and being met by a fiend who then went to pay for his parking ticket only one machine was working and it took 20 mins to pay for parking trying to get out of the place was chaos only one barrier seemed to work and then not for everyone so cars were backing up. 1 hour 35 mins to get from collecting our bags to exiting the car park.,2.0
1224,Flying off to the sun with Thompson TOM2512 on 14 September 2012 we arrived at 4.00 am for a 6.00 am flight and nearly missed it due to the long queue at T2. This queue was for a number of flights some leaving after us and very few check in desks were manned a nightmare! 1.5 hours to check in is bad not a modern international airport standard. I guess Manchester airport lost £40-£60 as we were not able to purchase breakfast or shop in the duty free so they loose money and give a bad service to 3 customers! Having a single long queue for any number of flights does not work on our return at Venice we queued for our flight only result check in 15 mins. Come on Manchester you are letting Thomson and others down and if I have a choice I will not use you again. Sorry Thomson the holiday was great the hotel fantastic but you will not have our bookings again if we have to fly from this poorly organised airport.,1.0
1225,I'm lucky in that I'm fast tracked through immigration/customs/security so that's one headache less. I don't like that when you leave this area behind you then find yourself in the middle of a duty free shop and have to negotiate countless obstacles. The lounges are sub standard unless your travelling Etihad or Emirates. The travelators don't work toilets dirty and not enough seating at the gates. Arriving is worse - no heating travelators not working general unfriendliness and the toilets in the baggage hall too small and unsanitary. £1 for the trolley's and no where to change money. One pay machine for the car park if you can find it and when you do there is a queue. All designed to rip you off. First impression for many people arriving is not a good one and that's not good for Manchester and the north of England business. Third world airport and the management just don't care.,1.0
1226,We flew out of Terminal 1 on the 3rd of September and arrived via the train terminal using the lifts on arrival in the airport is confusing they do not clearly state which level you need to be on and a lot of people were confused. Many of the travelators were not in use and there was a very long walk to our gate. Lots of people have debilitating illnesses that do not require a wheelchair for example asthma arthritis and so on so the lack of any assistance from the travelators or any other form makes the walk very difficult! Returning into Terminal 2 on the 17th was even worse it was a longer walk which proved extremely difficult for one of our party in particular. Once again not all travelators were working and when we got the end of a very long walk we found the lift down to the rail terminal was also broken so we had to struggle with large cases and hand luggage down the escalator - quite a dangerous exercise! This is the last time I will use this airport it is decidedly non-accessible for those with difficulties had there been the use of golf type buggies in operation or if the facilities in place had at least been working it would have been far less traumatic!,1.0
1227,T3. 18 Sep 12 at 0730. Having read some horror stories was a bit concerned with using MCR. Courtesy transport from nearby hotel had to drop passengers off in the morning drizzle - it appear there is no undercover drop-off for courtesy vehicles users. Check-in prompt and courteous security very efficient friendly and well manned. Post security facilities clean and varied with ample seating overlooking the ramp and runways. Gate allocation only about 30 min prior to departure and a lengthy hike but well manageable. T3 is certainly not letting Manchester down at least not today.,9.0
1228,I usually fly from Manchester and have never experienced a problem with the airport or its staff itself until my last trip at the weekend. Terminal 3 now caters for a vast array of airlines instead of being a mainly BA terminal for domestic flights. As such it is a lot busier and on a Ryanair flight the queue stretched from the gate around the cafe and past the duty free shops - poor organisation there. I was also reprimanded at the entrance to security for having a plastic bag of the wrong type! A food bag with a knot in the top that is very obviously able to be resealed. Apparently this is not allowed - even though I fly regularly and have never been told this before in any airport. When I questioned the security officer he said well alright then but you'll have a better chance if you put it in your partners plastic bag even though its too big (again nothing ever mentioned before about the size of the plastic bag he takes on). Surprise surprise not even one eyelash batted about either of our plastic bags. Just a jobsworth out to cause hassle at 5.30am.,7.0
1229,If you're arriving by train and using Terminal 3 this airport is a grim experience. KLM has recently moved from Terminal 2 to 3 - I used this airport regularly while they were at 2 but won't be doing so again if I can avoid it. There is no easy walking route from the railway station to Terminal 3: it's about a mile takes 20-30 minutes and involves multiple waits for lifts and dragging your luggage across a rough tarmac footpath in the rain. I could not find a baggage trolley for love nor money either on my outward or return journeys. Once you make it into the actual terminal the queue for the Internet bag drop is ridiculous (and security if you can't use the frequent flyer fast lane). The airside restaurant area was full of drunken rowdy passengers catching the Ryanair flights that seem to account for most of this terminal's traffic. None of the restaurants that I could find had any vegetarian food options and once again there were long queues for every retail outlet in the airside departure area. The toilet I used near the KLM gate was smelly and filthy.,3.0
1230,Arrived at Manchester airport at 5.30 am on 2nd Sept 2012 for flight to Faro departing at 7.35 am. The check in and security took so long that a visit to the toilet before boarding was the only thing I had time for (2 hours in total) Then to top that we was one of the last people onboard the Monarch flight to receive a hot drink. The drink was served to us 30 minutes before landing - 10.00 am. We had planned to buy some books etc at the airport but due to a shortage of check - in staff the whole experience was a total nightmare. The journey back from Faro airport was a complete different experience. The Monarch air crew also managed to serve drinks much sooner.,1.0
1231,Leaving was OK. Once bags were checked we were through security and into departures in no time. Coming back was a very different story. Manchester portrays itself as a modern airport but two American Airways flights landing closely together meant long tedious queues for passengers at immigration and no access to automated kiosks. Following our queuing up and down we had a further very long delay until they decided to start throwing the baggage onto the belt. I do mean throwing as I saw two cases come shooting through the rubber doors and fall off the belt onto the floor on the passenger side. This was accompanied by hoots of laughter from baggage handlers and eventually someone did come through to throw the bags back onto the line. Pretty shoddy all round. I have said before that I dislike Manchester and the lack of organisation there nothing has changed and I avoid this airport if at all possible.,1.0
1232,Often more of a bazaar than a set of airport terminals especially at T1 Manchester's real strength is in bringing third-world standards to the UK. It's aided in this by Northern Rail's 30-year old historic-bus-style Pacer Trains that wobble hopefully to and from the airport - ours managed to take 2 hours for the 50 miles from the airport to Southport.,4.0
1233,"What has happened to Terminal 3? This used to be pretty efficient however in their usual random wisdom MAN has once again re-assigned airlines from one terminal to another resulting in a sudden influx of KLM/AF and Ryanair flights into Terminal 3. The entire experience is horrendous check in is very tight on space so you'll ""join a queue to join a queue"" and face passengers with trolleys trying to squeeze past each other in both directions. Outbound security is now very busy at peak times. On the plus side the equipment is modern and efficient and staff pleasant. Once through security T3 is still the poky place it always was fine when it was for domestics (for which it was built) but now completely over stressed. On return similar crummy experience awaits with long queues for UK border - even with 100% manning there are only 4 desks that I can see and unlike other MAN terminals there is no e-gate. Generally I like MAN and most criticism is misplaced but Terminal 3 is horrible.",3.0
1234,I fly regularly out of Terminals 1 and 3 most recently out of Terminal 1 and have always been impressed at the shortness of the queues through security. It must help that unlike most airports Manchester seems to have most security channels manned! Terminal 1 has plenty of places to eat drink shop if you have to and most importantly sit!,10.0
1235,Flight to Mahon Friday 13th July. Security at passport control was extremely poor. Asked to remove belt etc. I told them my wallet had metal in the young lad shrugged his shoulders and said it didn't matter? It was coins and keys. My wife's tray went thought first and she watched but the lady on the x-ray machine was turned away chatting to some one we both commented at the time. Very worrying. Not surprised young lad got though and landed in Rome!,4.0
1236,Security queue in Terminal 1 a joke anytime I travel through here - 35 minutes to get through security last time (normally about 20/25 minutes which isn't good either) - archaic and claustrophobic boarding gates are another minus. Duty free is good though.,1.0
1237,I am a frequent traveller at Manchester airport. The check-in concourse is organised and laid out clearly. There is also a selection of cafés and eateries which I have found very useful when arriving too early or waiting for an arriving passenger. Proficient security staff although I fly at peak times I have never had a waiting time of longer than 5 minutes. Departure concourse clearly laid out however I find having to pass through the BIZA duty free store very irritating even more so if travelling with children. The first class escape lounge is good in terms of the service provided.,10.0
1238,Arrived from Skiathos and all the passengers endured a two hour wait for their bags to arrive on the carousel. Apparently they were sent to the wrong terminal. However no one took control of the situation and it was only when passengers started complaining that any information came through. Typical corporate buck passing with no one at the airport accepting responsibility.,2.0
1239,Travel through Manchester 3-4 times a month and always find it a decent experience. Terminals 1 and 2 are pretty good with a good selection of shops if you're into that kind of thing. Terminal 3 is always a disappointment to me seems to be lacking in restaurants and somewhere to get a drink (unless you find a table in the almost always packed central food court). T1 and T2 have lounges that I can access so a plus there the Wilmslow lounge has fantastic views. If you avoid the busy central area in T1 which is always full of lager louts on a stag trip to Benidorm the terminal has some quiet spots at either end of piers B and C also the toilets just left before the 'walk-through' duty free are usually quieter and cleaner than the rest. Lots of complaints about security on here but I always find it a breeze even at peak times if you're patient and prepare (don't decide to rumble through your pants for change/phones/wallet just before you get to the scanner you've had 10 mins to prepare!). All in all pretty good but it is annoying you can't walk indoors from T1 to T3 anymore.,7.0
1240,I travel through Manchester a few times a year. It's always bright and clean. The travelator system connecting the rail station and the terminals is lovely and easy although some people inevitably find it hard to walk in a straight line or are on a last minute and push through everyone else. Security not a problem. The only issue being made to pay £1 for a plastic bag for liquids as the one I bring is never exactly the right kind. The shops past security are big and take up space but if you move past them there's hundreds and hundreds of chairs that are nearly always empty near to the gates. The food/drink is overpriced it's an airport. So I always go to Boots to buy their sandwiches/drinks as they have the same price as their high street stores unlike WHSmiths Burger King etc.,9.0
1241,Our family group of 7 including 2 children under 5 arrived at 9 pm at terminal 1. Everything was fine until we went to collect a trolley the pound coin (non refundable) didn't work and nobody had another one. The place was deserted. Meanwhile my son realised that his bike that he had paid extra for had not arrived even though we had seen it put on the plane Went to Global baggage - her response was it couldn't have been put on! You can imagine our frustration the place was deserted the two officials completely disinterested. Eventually a security man came complaining that a bike bag had been left causing a security alert! It turned out the bike had been put at the back of a completely different conveyor belt! No apologies and we were made to feel it was our fault for not looking properly! Eventually left airport at about 10.30pm. Unfortunately this is our local airport!,2.0
1242,In my opinion T2 is the most rationally planned of the 3 terminals in MAN airport though maybe the most anonymous. Both floors arrivals and departures before restricted areas have space devoted to the needs of arriving and departing passengers with minimal resources for friend/relatives and passers by. The impression on arrival is about under-utilization of space. At departures security is well planned. Flying out early in the morning on a week day crowd was medium and 6 desks out of 12 were open. Pass through in less than 10 minutes also thanks to body-scanners. Agents professional and respect passengers. The duty free area is just the way I like it to be. If you want you roam around if you don't you just go straight to the gates area. The gates area has plenty of coffee shops takeaways and restaurants. Most of the gates are just at hand but you should allow for a 5 minutes walk for the farthest at the two sides. Excellent view of apron. A few mini coffee shops spotted near the far gates are a gem for people which are rushed to the gate by the speakers only to find out that a 200 people line is just lazily forming. From the airport it is a 5 minutes indoor walk to Radisson Hotel and 10 to the Airport Train Station if travelators are working. From the station you are at Manchester Piccadilly Station in less than 15 minutes.,8.0
1243,Very old and drab airport. Profits taken with little reinvestment travelators often not working. Walk from T3 to Station terrible camber all wrong for luggage and dangerous Non refundable £1 for trolleys ridiculous. Suggest airlines reduce payments until airport brought up to standard for customers. I use this airport once a month.,2.0
1244,Very disappointing airport. Long queues. Upon arrival trolleys require non-refundable £1 coins to use which is a pain for those flying from abroad. No porter service available at all. No staff on arrival to assist with trolleys and suitcases. Other staff completely unhelpful saying that it's not their job to help! Poor bathrooms with limited space not clean and limited family facilities. One of the worst airports I have been to. Parking is ridiculously expensive and even drop off at certain areas has to paid for.,2.0
1245,MAN-CDG. When we arrived at T3 departures there was a massive queue to check-in which meant we only had 10 minutes to get to the gate and explore duty free! Fortunately security was only about 5 minutes due to the lack of people using the terminal. For once staff at the airport were for helpful and friendly! I would defiantly use Manchester airport again.,8.0
1246,I had the great misfortune to use this airport every Friday night to travel back to the UK. Always the same flight and every time queues at passport control were massive! At best they only had a third of desks open. No idea why it is a problem to organise this better - waiting 40 min to get through the passport control is unacceptable! At least I had no issues retrieving my baggage - I know through experience that Manchester Airport's baggage handlers are the slowest so I only travel with hand luggage if I go through MAN airport! On way out I find it disappointing that I am forced to go through duty free even when I do not want to shop! As all the spare room is filled with shops there is not enough seating when a few flights are delayed.,2.0
1247,Manchester to Dublin quick check-in quickly through security. No problems at all. Arriving back quick again no issues.,8.0
1248,Return to Sydney. Outbound flight delayed overnight so large queues to retrieve baggage and get to hotel. Following morning enormous queues for check-in and then flight delayed another 2 hours. On return the arrivals is dismal. Dark narrow corridors which seem endless before you reach the maze that is passport control. Very unattractive. On a positive note on my return I was off the plane quickly found hardly anyone in front of me at PP and then my case was on the carousel within 10 minutes.,5.0
1249,T3 to LHR with BA to connect with flight to WAW; returned to T3 with bmi. Last flight of the day outward terminal very quiet as shops were shutting down. Cleared check-in and security in less than 10 minutes. Flight departed on time. Flight slightly delayed upon return and no airbridge - bussed to the terminal from about 400m away (not sure why but this isn't usual for this flight). However bags were already on the belt before we arrived at the carousels so no further delays and no complaints.,9.0
1250,The worst experience I have had at an airport getting to / from the rail station and T3 is a real challenge. An awful camber makes pushing the trolleys very hard work and as of 10th April they are charging £1 or 2 euros for the use of them which is non refundable. If the weather is poor (rain or wind) this trip is made even more miserable. Another nasty surprise is the £1 charge for a clear re-sealable bag for security these are free at every other airport I use. Beside these bad points T3 is quite a pleasant place but its the last time I'll be using it.,2.0
1251,Left T3 on a Sunday afternoon. Dropping off is not ideal because you have to cross the road but at least there is no charge for it. Terminal not busy at all. Few facilities before security but there's a good Costa cafè. More staff at security than passengers when I passed. Security seems ready for big flows. There are body scanners there but I've rarely seen them used. Overall impression is efficiency and focus on getting people through as quick as possible. After security signposting for the upper floor gates is not immediately visible. Looks like signs to gates are hidden for a purpose so you walk around the omnipresent duty free stands. The terminal airside is airy and well lit with sufficient things to do. Carpets look a bit worn out. There's plenty of seats in the gate areas but not vending machines as is the case for T1.,8.0
1252,"T3 to LHR. bmi check-in was quick and efficient. Flight delayed for 90 mins due to problems at LHR. The new scanners are a significant improvement with no more of the ""shoes off!"" nonsense still seen at London airports reducing the time needed to clear security. Facilities airside are acceptable for short waiting times but aren't adequate for long delays/layovers. Cleanliness much better than my last T3 flight.",9.0
1253,Manchester is an efficient airport. I have flown from T2 mainly with KLM and Air France almost every week for the past 13 years - and must say that their move to T3 has seen an improvement in security waiting times and passport queues on arrival. The BA lounge is OK - even if not as good now they've flogged part of it off to Flybe. Use T1 on occasions with Finnair and Aer Lingus. Rarely have a long wait for takeoff - taxi times usually short and holding - rare. As with many airports it is constantly being improved and updated - which must in the long run be a good thing for the travelling public.,9.0
1254,Going through security on Monday Jan 16h at about 08.45 in T2 notice that the security staff have resorted to shouting rather than a portable microphone. Also when your Tray of belongings have passed through the X- ray scanner they just push it along with passengers no where near surely a security problem. Also going out we were on a Remote stand T2 bussed out to remote parking with Aircraft steps no problem coming back waited 15 minutes for steps. Airport low Aircraft Traffic at 18.00 hours is there a staffing problem after 5pm.,4.0
1255,My hometown airport richly deserves its no-star rating at least for those of us unlucky enough to be using terminal 1. The gate areas are draughty drab and uncomfortable especially for those on A380s who get shoved down to the far end of the gate area. The whole thing has the 'temporary/prefab' vibe one also finds in other 1960s-1970s British architecture. It's all so desperately tired and cramped. Tear it down and rebuild please.,2.0
1256,On 16 December we sat on a plane for just over 4 hours waiting for de-icing! This was on a day when inclement weather was anticipated and following two winter periods when airports were unprepared for bad weather. Manchester is clearly still not able to meet its obligations to passengers and airlines in poor weather. Prior to that departures was a mess with people joining wrong airline queues because of a lack of organisation. On return immigration was a breeze but we had to wait over 30 minutes for bags to come onto the line. When they did the line kept breaking down because of the way bags baby buggies and so forth were flung onto the belt causing it to jam. I will avoid Manchester if at all possible in future.,4.0
1257,Used T1 in and out - business class check and quick security - otherwise long queues. Etihad lounge excellent. On return speedy Immigration and luggage retrieval. However overall impression was poor after South African Airports.,6.0
1258,Two separate flights from LHR and GTW to T3. On both occasions bags on the belt within 5 minutes of leaving the plane. Domestic flights so no security to clear. On a train into town within 20 minutes of landing so no complaints whatsoever. Cleanliness is still a problem though I wasn't at the airport long enough for it to matter to me but this does need to be addressed.,9.0
1259,Terminal 1 Arriving from Palma 13.30 on a Wednesday. Immigration queues. Its almost as if its a surprise to immigration staff that passengers get off planes and need to be processed. Only 4 immigration staff on duty. The automatic gates were not working again. Bearing in mind that the A380 had just arrived from Dubai and you get the picture. It took us well over an hour to get through. This has to change. I fly through this airport 5-6 times a year so it not a one off event. I hope Manchester management read this and act on it.,2.0
1260,Arrived at 13.55 from BCN on ZB at T1. Disembarked down a flight of stairs walked 10 yds then ascend the mirror image of the stairs you have just come down through a dingy corridor then joining a backlog of passengers stuck on an another staircase (with the escalator switched off) prior to immigration. On way there look down into generously spaced out shopping concourse - is this where the money went that should have been spent on a welcoming arrivals area. Used the e-passport channel machine can't read passport so went to Desk 12 where passport is instantly read. Enter crowded baggage reclaim area got my case and joined another bottleneck through customs. Glad to get out.,4.0
1261,Departed T2 on Thomson to Mykonos 08.20 departure. Self-serve check-in available which massively speeds up the process got our boarding cards from the machine and walked straight over to the bag drop desk bypassing the large Thomson check-in queue. Security was relatively busy but moved fast staff polite and efficient. Good choice of shops bars and restaurants the food court in T2 had a full breakfast and a drink offer for £5 which was good value for an airport again staff courteous. Clean tables and floor in spite of the terminal being quite busy nice relaxing background music in the food court created a calm atmosphere. Flight called at -30 and boarded quickly for an on-time departure. On our return there was a very large queue for passport control due to several flights arriving together and the E-Passport Gates were out of service causing us to wait for over 30 mins. We expected to find our luggage waiting on the carousel after this amount of time but then had to wait another 15 mins for suitcases to appear and typically ours were the last off. The departures process is very good but arrivals has plenty of room for improvement T2 Arrivals in particular is very dull and uninviting.,5.0
1262,Arrived back from Alicante to find we had to negotiate two flights of stairs which given our age of 75 to 80 yrs was rather difficult especially as we had been sat for 3 hrs. We didn't want to ask for disabled help as we felt we could manage. A number of passengers with tired young children also had trouble. Ran into a large queue and discovered it was for passport control apparently at least 4 planes had arrived at the same time even a large queue at the fast machines. Eventually arrived in the baggage hall to find our luggage strewn all over the floor. We normally enjoy 3 to 4 holidays a year but we have been reluctant to try this year and after this one we have to find an alternative. So come on Manchester please do something to ease passengers arrivals into the airport.,1.0
1263,Flew into and out of T2 a couple of times over the summer. Everything was smooth and efficient friendly staff. Clear straightforward link to the train station and beyond. More seating near the gates and a broader range of catering outlets wouldn't go a miss.,4.0
1264,Terminal 3. I never seem to have a problem with security queues at T3 although once through to departures the place is usually heaving throughout the day and not just at peak times. Good selection of bars/shops and a useful Boots for cheaper food.,5.0
1265,In and out of Terminal 3 over a few days and not a great experience. A mishmash of a mostly gloomy building(s) that really is quite second rate in this day and age. But it tries and at least they will let friends drop you off at the kerb without a charge. The weakest link is security. I went through it on departure at what I thought was an off peak time mid morning and it still took over 45 mins. It was just operating at a snails pace. If we have to go through all this then Manchester Airport please staff these check points fully and reduce the queues - and give some thought to the design of the security area as right now it is a confused and depressing bottleneck.,3.0
1266,"Standards definitely seem to be on a downhill slide at this airport - noticeable over the past 5 years. Generally use T2 - check-in queues are usually just about acceptable (we usually fly early morning) but delays in getting through security are becoming a real deterrent to using this airport. Over an hour's wait on our most recent departure just to clear the secure area. Completely understand the importance of security measures but the airport needs to employ more staff. We were in T2 in August and it seemed quieter than usual - however the food court still had debris all over most of the tables at 6am. Dread to think what it must be like later in the day. Knowing that we normally board approx 40 mins before departure time we presumed that we were on for a delay when nothing appeared on the departure boards - thankfully we strolled down to our gate to double check - only to find that boarding had commenced. No wonder you hear so many last minute calls for missing passengers. My main gripe however is the experience on return. It is not unusual to wait over 30 mins for an airbridge. This is bad enough but then you have to tackle the immigration process - woe betide if a large aircraft has landed from outside the EU - could be an hour's queuing. Once that hurdle has been overcome there is the joy of baggage retrieval which seems to take longer at Manchester than anywhere else. These issues need sorting as they are worsening every year and Manchester ""International"" Airport is starting to resemble the gateway to a third world country.",3.0
1267,Touched down from Abu Dhabi arriving at Terminal One. This airport looks old and drab compared to the modern airports of the Middle East. Did not have a pound coin to secure a trolley and struggled to find change anywhere. On my way out was expected to pay for a plastic bag to go through security with liquids. I think it's time Manchester Airport makes it's mind up: does it want to cater mainly for the package holiday market or does it want to be a major player attracting the big carriers.,2.0
1268,We have flown from Manchester on a number of occasions without problems. We will only fly from Manchester again if we are unable to find flights elsewhere. We arrived at Terminal 1 at 7.25 am for a 9.30 am flight information having indicating check-in began 2 hours prior to take-off. Check-in completed quickly and on to Security to find a huge queue of people. We learnt the queue ended quite a distance outside the building with no- one to advise what was happening eventually an employee asked passengers to follow her to the front of the queue. Surely the airport authorities should try to offset this by ensuring all security terminals were open to allow a much quicker flow of passengers. We eventually got through Security and saw our Departure gate was open we practically ran through Duty Free/Shopping area in order to find our Gate. Our return flight was spoiled by the wait for luggage coming off the plane.,1.0
1269,Arrived and returned from T3 in Manchester. A good all round airport. Well laid out and well maintained. Despite being pretty large it was easy to negotiate with enough security that were warmer than in most airports. Food and shopping in T3 is good with plenty of bright inviting shops. Although based on the food outlet I used for coffee and snacks pricing was reasonable.,5.0
1270,I have travelled through Manchester airport many times and I have never found a problem. I am quite happy to queue at security if this means security are doing their job. I don't shop at the airport prices can be a little expensive but no more than other European airports. I have travelled via all 3 terminals and will say it is one of the cleanest airports I know.,5.0
1271,Arrived T2. First time back for 10 yrs drinking fountain did not work and did not have 1 pound for the baggage trolley money not required in Brisbane Munich & Singapore. I dragged my family & suitcases out into terminal shabby & poor first image of UK experience. Went to pick up hire car closed in T2 at so had to drag suitcases all the way to T1. Agree with other reviews about going up to security long queues forced to walk through duty free. Little selection of shops or facilities for a major international airport fruit machines everywhere. Must say though all staff very cheerful and helpful. Need's to improve if UK wants to the break free of tired run down image.,2.0
1272,"Terminal 1 seems to forget that not everyone wants to be bombarded with noise/music from retail & food outlets. Ridiculous route from aircraft to passport control up & down stairs then joining another queue. Not welcoming if you're in a wheelchair as it appears difficult to manoeuvre. Then everyone is made to enter a set of metal barriers (surely a hazard in such small space?) all heading towards passport control unlucky to have just got off Emirates because this flight alone was enough to fill passport control. For people arriving the first time especially if having been to Singapore Paris Hong Kong etc their impression will be one of dismay; it's like a ""before"" picture that hasn't managed to make it to the ""after"" stage.",3.0
1273,Flew out to Amsterdam with KLM from T2. Despite checking in online there was no bag drop everyone had to stand in the long check in queue. Up the escalator to the shops. Going through security was quick. I had planned to have some breakfast but the food area looked grubby even at the start of the day so I got something from Boots. On the return the queue for passport control was huge. Husband got through the iris scanner ok but it rejected me. When that happens you're supposed to be able to go to the front of the queue but I had to go to the back by which time another plane had landed and the queue was even longer. When I finally got to the front some 20 mins later they were telling people to have their passports ready and to go through as a family group to speed things up. The officer told me that they'd been having problems with the iris scanner rejecting people and they didn't know why. They had the booths there they will be using for biometric passports and I believe that will be their focus for the future as apparently iris has turned out to be a bit of an expensive white elephant.,3.0
1274,Manchester airport is trying! Still needs work on the cleanliness of it's restaurants. Had breakfast in the healthy choice area in Terminal 2. Food was good but the table chairs and floor all around were filthy went to another table/area same problem - ended up going to get paper napkins and cleaning the table myself. The seating/floor area needs a thorough cleaning at night time when there are less people eating at the restaurant. We travel a lot and Manchester airport has the potential to be a first class facility.,4.0
1275,Travelled to Tenerife on 3rd Jun. Long queues at check-in desks really bad queues on return on 17th Jun at border control on return to UK. Returned on flight of 350 people and only 4 personnel at border control queuing for 30 mins. Then sent to the wrong carousel for baggage our bags were nowhere in sight. We were told to go to another carousel and a few bags from our flight appeared. Then there was another wait of about 20 mins with no bags before they started to appear. In total it took us 1.5 hrs to clear the airport. It is disgraceful. This is certainly not the first time we have had problems with border control queues and baggage collection at this airport. We will travel from East Midlands in the future.,1.0
1276,Flight to Cork and to Tel Aviv. Fast procedures good check in with Aer Lingus flight little bit tiresome procedures with Jet2. Good shops and restaurants just one comment the customs service not always open (VAT refund).,4.0
1277,If you are disabled then avoid this airport at all cost. Arrived at T3 at 4am checked in and told to go to the assistance area which was closed and would not be open to 5am arriving there found no seats - there are seats inside when open but when closed none! Finally checked in at the assistance area but computers down so pen and paper out and the fiasco continued we were late to board and the guy who was helping us must be the most miserable man I have ever met. On the return I found myself being given a free tour of Manchester Airport as the staff tried countless times with their swipe cards and codes as they tried to get a convoy of disabled people to the right place.,1.0
1278,The first time I have been through Terminal 2 since improvements completed and was very impressed. There was no wait at Security shops and seating are now far better and there is more choice of food. On arrival no wait at immigration and the bags only took a few minutes to arrive. I made it from the stand to the arrivals hall in under 15 minutes!,5.0
1279,Evening flight short 5 minute walk from station to T1 check-in queue no longer than 10 minutes. Security fast track very efficient not that the regular queue was huge staff at security efficient cleared in 5 minutes. Airside lots of shops not a fan of walking through duty free and way finding through this area is very poor. Good choice of shops with 3 bars and 2 restaurants that weren't particularly overpriced. On return immigration busy but used the new E-Passport gates. Our luggage arrived in around 20 minutes and a short walk back to the station on a bus home within 35 mins of landing. MAN has had its fair share of problems over the years the up-and-down flights of stairs to access gates but it is much improved since refurbishment.,5.0
1280,Terminal 2. Improved Check-in (KLM) efficient and quick Security - more space and less grumpy. As bad as ever : wall of retail as soon as you're through security lack of quiet places to sit and wait.,3.0
1281,I fly weekly from T3 and frequently from T1 and T2. Compared to other airports I use its standard of cleanliness and trasnport connectivity is pretty good. Queues at security are often long but move quickly and announcements are made for any customers on soon-departing flights to be fast-tracked. When I've dealt with airport staff they've been courteous and efficient. Facilities at each terminal are pretty good if expensive but they aren't the worst I've come across! Note that proceeds from the £1 charge for a resealable bag for liquids go to a local childrens charity not to the airport. The main issue is that airport really needs to improve its layout - the ad hoc development over the past 5-10 years has left it a bit of a mess and inefficient which had a negative effect on your overall impression.,4.0
1282,Forcing you to walk through the duty-free shops to get to your gate is a crass marketing stunt and probably has the opposite effect of what they want if people are like me it makes me keep my hands firmly in my pocket and not spend anything in any of the shops. With online check-in if your plane's on time you can get to the gate sharpish and not have to use the cafes or shops! Also the sheer volume of retail space means there are few areas to sit in and the flight display boards are difficult to find. All this spoils what otherwise is a fine airport good rail land bus links and fairly quick passage through security.,3.0
1283,I travel through Manchester (usually terminal 1) four or five times a year. Some things have improved since they have revamped this terminal. The only downside is having to plough your way threw the maze duty free shops once you have cleared security. Security checks have speeded up during this past year and it would appear to be more staff on duty during busy periods. Terminal 2 is now long overdue for refurbishing.,4.0
1284,Overall good airport with attractive shopping facilities and layout. Only downside can be cleanliness at times and poor signage.,4.0
1285,Terminal 1 has had a total revamp since I was last in it. Departures is now full of stylish shops but negotiating your way through those shops is like finding your way through a maze. On arrival back in Manchester from South America (via LHR) my bags arrived within 5 minutes of departing the aircraft and I was in the railway station 35 minutes after landing so no complaints about Manchester airport.,4.0
1286,Arriving by LH or LX you are forced to walk downstairs after entering the building from the airbridge - just to be forced back upstairs a few yards down the corridor. Madness! Otherwise this airport offers reasonably short distances but small waiting areas at some gates.,3.0
1287,Gone downhill since I lived in Manchester and was going downhill then. Generally shabby and the only improvement is in security facilities although charging Â£1 for a plastic bag for liquids is outrageous. Two particular complaints - moving walkways badly maintained I counted 4 out of 14 not working between the railway station and T2. Impossible in T2 to walk from security to departures without going through the duty free shop.,2.0
1288,Overall a good experience. The redesigning of T1 airside and the consequent increased security check area has dramatically reduced the queues since the last time I used this airport. But there are far two many shops; being forced to pass through the huge duty free complex on departure is disorientating and slows progress through to the gate for those pax with not much time. And the amount of space dedicated to shops - even a supermarket! - in the arrivals area causes serious bottlenecks at busy times.,4.0
1289,Much improved facilities since my last visit - more preferable to T3 at LHR in fact. Even with mid morning midweek arrival from CPH on non EU passport I was away from airport in hire car inside 1 hour. Access to North-South and East-West motorways excellent. Security for return flight no worse than many international airports I have transitted - at least the staff spoke English!,3.0
1290,Checking in and getting through security is much improved at Manchester and they have got this pretty spot on. The facilities are good the staff always polite and the place very clean. However they have a bad problem with baggage on low cost or budget airlines. It can take up to an hour for the bags to start coming. On a flight with Jet2 in November 2010 it took an hour and 30 minutes to clear the airport from landing to getting in a cab. This was down to the fact it took over and hour to get our bag even though we seemed to be the only flight in that terminal at that time. This is not uncommon and they do need to sort it out. Also expect long queues at immigration on occasions even when coming in from the EU. This is also an area which is very poor with not enough staff for the volume of flights.,4.0
1291,Terminal 2 outbound got through check-in and security quickly - on a Thursday afternoon in late September check-in was almost deserted. Security staff firm but polite and friendly to a fellow-passenger who seemed unaware of the 100ml limit on liquids/gels in hand baggage. On return in mid-October around lunchtime on a Saturday bags arrived quickly and we got from the aircraft to the rail station in under half an hour. My one gripe is the distance between the rail station and Terminal 2 - not helped outbound by the moving walkways being largely out of action. But overall a good experience.,4.0
1292,"Early check in for our 6 am flight polite and friendly check in staff. The airport was virtually empty and due to an early flight we thought as there were very few passengers security would be reasonably stress free. All I can say is passengers were fine but staff seemed to be hyped up even though there was only a trickle of passengers going through. My daughter was chosen by some female jobsworth to go through the body scanner and had orders barked at her - she was asked if she had liquids she didn't - took 3 times for this woman to ask my daughter and 3 times to for her to say emphatically ""no"". Seating was fine for us in the Departure Lounge but I suppose later seating would be difficult to find.",3.0
1293,I agree with the recent reviews that Manchester airport is on a downwards spiral . In September we found the T1 shopping mall claustrophobic with no real seating area and the food is poor. We were delayed and enquired about a childrens area which there is none or even a decent seating area. It seems to be about squeezing the assets and more worryingly is that nobody has ever replied and made a complaint after we had undertaken the manchester airport online survey! I use T3 once a month for business and is better for speed cleanliness etc but then I use the business lounge what a difference!,2.0
1294,I am interested to read Peter Cloney's review from August - I couldn't agree more. I travel through Manchester Airport twice a week which like Peter gives the ability to step back from the short-term issues which often side-track passengers in their critique. I regularly contact the airport management team with my concerns and am yet to hear back on any issue despite their promise of getting back to you within 5 working days. Recently I was travelling with hand luggage only and as instructed at security I placed any fluids in a tray along with my phone keys etc. The only fluid I had was a single tube of toothpaste which I placed in the tray. I was informed that even though it was a single item I still needed a clear plastic bag which I would have to buy for £1. Even though it seems ridiculous to need a clear bag for 1 item (I thought the clear bags were to keep your fluids together and limit the amount you could take on board - I highly doubt that a plastic bag improves the view that the security controller gets of your liquids and gels) I agreed only to find that the point where I had to buy the bag was after security! Added to this absurd procedure was the fact that I was treated with utter contempt by the staff on duty. My other gripe are the drop-off arrangements at T1. They have made some changes where now cars and taxis have to pull into one of 15 parking spaces rather than simply dumping their passengers by the door to the terminal. This causes horrendous tail backs often onto the M56 spur.,2.0
1295,Been using Manchester Airport for 20 years at least 3 times a month often more frequently. This long-term user history gives me the ability to step back from the short-term issues which often side-track passengers in their critique. I am completely clear in my mind that for the last 5 years this airport has been and remains on a downward spiral in terms of virtually every key aspect which is important to all passengers and particularly to regular users. The overall cleanliness of Terminal 1 is on a par with a third world city bus terminus the appallingly slowly speed of baggage claim from the carousels even at the quietest times of the day beggars belief as to why everything takes so long the extremely frequent failure of the advanced car-park booking system at the critical moment of inserting the credit card in the barrier to leave the car-park is so well known and feared in my company that no one trusts it now to use it. But the worse aspect of the whole airport and its management is that no one appears to care. No one responds to complaints no one is interested. The only interest appears to be the promotion of as many retails outlets as possible within the complex. As viewed by many of my non-UK colleagues this airport is one to avoid and if business can be done outside NW England with the benefit of avoiding Manchester Airport so much the better in their view.,1.0
1296,I've been using Terminal 3 twice weekly for the last few months. With on-line check-in after a short walk from the railway station I'm in the departure lounge ten to fifteen minutes from arrival at the terminal. The staff seem to have made efforts to smooth the passage through security. A turnstile system gains entry operated by the barcode on your boarding pass. Staff are employed to help should you encounter a problem with this. There is a fast-moving queue for scanners. Shopping and food facilities are limited but adequate. Gates can be a bit cramped but I've yet to fail to find a seat. Signage is good. Arrival is no problem and there is a drop-off/pick-up area nearby so you can be away very fast. Long term on-site parking can be problematic as it gets very full but there are other options.,4.0
1297,"First upon disembarkation from an airbridge you have to go down two flights of stairs turn left and then climb up to what was exactly the same level a few yards away. Ridiculous. Then the automatic passport reader could not read my passport upon which I was told that my passport ""does not have a chip"" (despite displaying the chip symbol on the cover) and told to go to a manned desk. There my passport could not be scanned either (although it had been scanned at FRA without a problem a few hours earlier that afternoon). Strangely when handed to yet another immigration counter scanning happened instantly. When departing from Gate 22 the same unbelievable architectural obstacle presented itself in reverse: go down two flight of stairs turn right and climb back to the same level as before. Needs improving!",3.0
1298,Arriving on overnight flight from Doha at 8am. Coinciding with flights from Orlando and others meant that the queue at immigration was very long. And guess what - the biometric machines not working so I couldn't fast track. And also there were only half the desks open. So it took an age to get through. Maybe planes arriving early morning is a surprise for the authorities. And I still had to wait for my bags. I have just returned from Iran and they were much more efficient! And don't get me started on the fact that you have to pay to be picked up by car. Why don't they introduce a 30 minute free parking if they dont want people clogging up a pick up lane? Many other airports do that. Its a pity as recently this airport seemed to have improved its baggage reclaim speed.,3.0
1299,Flew in and out of T2. While queuing for the baggage drop on the outward trip I was not impressed by a group of yobs fighting (in one case vomiting) in the check-in area and less impressed by the sight of airport staff studiously ignoring them. The queue for security was 8-10 minutes and perfectly reasonable. I don't like being forced to walk through the duty free shop to get to the plane though - tacky. Free copies of the Manchester Evening News in the airside waiting area are a nice touch. On the return trip there was no more than a 2-3 minute queue for immigration and 10-15 for luggage reclaim which seems reasonable.,3.0
1300,T3 Easyjet to Corsica. No problems. Staff pleasant and helpful. Good choice of shops and cafes after security. Spacious departure lounges. Luggage on carousel straight after landing. Easy walk from the Radisson Hotel and to the T3 long stay car park. Immigration officials - the all too common unnecessary unpleasant attitude - what a welcome back to the UK.,5.0
1301,Manchester T2. Some improvements since last use - better arrangements for security - where they've followed the T1 model and descoped landside in favour of more space for security and airside. But once through security you have to force your way through the usual plethora of shops to get to any seating areas. Returning revealed Manchester at its worst. Early arrival completely surprised the place (as usual) with no-one around to operate airbridge. No travelators working though we were at the extremity of the terminal. Enormous queue at passport control. New machines installed to handle biometric passsports worked OK - certainly better than IRIS (that wouldn't be hard) - and allowed a bit of fast-tracking. Luggage retrieval very slow. On exit from baggage hall total chaos as meeters & greeters were being allowed to completely bottle up the exit pathway. Needless to say no-one from the airport was to be seen trying to ease passenger flow. Despite some improvements it remains a desperate airport and a far cry from its glory days in the 70s. Still there are a lot of shops and that's the only thing that really appears to interest the administration.,2.0
1302,Outbound I was pleased with the service apart from the inevitable queues at security partly caused by passengers who are not prepared for screening and hold the rest of us up. Not the fault of the airport other than the fact that too few scanners were in operation and there was inadequate notices about what to expect. Inbound made to queue in a totally inadequate passport hall which was clearly undergoing renovation. Only two desks and no automated or IRIS systems. Baggage seemed to take forever.,3.0
1303,Flew out of T2 to AMS and return. On way out queuing minimal at check-in and security and straight through to main T2 area. Do not like the newly remodelled layout security side - very little to do now lack of seating only one bar (previously there were 3?) which struggled to cope with a low volume of custom and outside the main duty free shop very little else. Saw documentary on TV recently stating this remodelling was supposed to enhance the customer airport experience - suggest they either should have saved their money or do some proper market research on what the customer actually wants! Way back - long queues at customs (30 mins +) with only 2 planes of people present - this may get better once the passport scanners as per in T1 are activated. Luggage turned up promptly and was able to still catch preferred train even though flight arrived 20 minutes late.,3.0
1304,30 March to Dalaman. Queue to check in took one and half hours security took one hour had to go straight to boarding but had to run the maze of shops to get to the gate.,2.0
1305,Found very little landside but when passed security things improved. Pretty good choice of shops and cafes but not the best. At departures found the lack of signage for the Skywalk a bit disconcerting. Ground services extremely poor and not up to BAA standards which must be a tough one for the airport management to take. Toilets were old and tatty but cleaning okay.,2.0
1306,Flew back from Chambery airport and landed at 1335 hrs the bags did not arrive on the baggage belt until 1505 hrs - over an hour and a half wait for the baggage for all the passengers on the flight! No explanation other than the bags were on the flight that much we knew already. There was no one in the baggage enquiry office near belt 1 for over half an hour. This was so frustrating that several passengers entered this unlocked office and sat around looking through various documentation. When the member of staff did arrive he said that he had nothing to do with the bags being loaded on the belt from the plane and could not do anything. The whole delay was caused significant disruption to all passengers with connecting flights trains and transport all being missed. A very poor service from the airport.,1.0
1307,MAN-LHR evening 3rd March. I checked in online with hand luggage. Security was a breeze and I was through within minutes. Staff polite and friendly. Then used the BA lounge which is a great facility. Use the airport regularly and have rarely experienced any problems. The infrastructure is tatty though and the attempts to squeeze every last penny out of passengers obvious.,4.0
1308,"Travelled to AMS and return from T2. KLM have introduced machines for passengers to print out their own boarding cards - fairly easy to use and supposed to save time. Then there is the queue to check in bags - at just after 4:00 am this was huge - involving a wait of 20 to 30 minutes - KLM seem to have the most relaxed baggage policy of any airline - I sure some of the passengers were taking the kitchen sink! The baggage check in staff then ask all the same questions previously answered on the machines. I found security to be OK - even being required to use the new ""X-ray"". Due to the long wait at check in I did not have a lot of time to explore the ""shopping opportunities"" flight side. Having used MAN several times I am always disappointed by the food options. On my return immigration queues were lengthy - but luckily all the channels were staffed. Baggage handling agents promptly told me that my bags had been left behind in AMS - so no unnecessary wait for bags that were never going to arrive! Used the new meet and greet valet parking - very convenient. However on arrival home I found the car radio aerial had disappeared.",3.0
1309,I find the majority of the ground staff surly and at times rude and disinterested. My recent experience involved arriving back from Gran Canaria touching down at approximately 3:15 am on 3rd January having already been delayed by around 4 hours in departure. Having made our way to the baggage collection area with my family and disabled 6 year old son in an airport wheelchair we waited over 2 hours for our baggage to come around including my sons own wheelchair. If this wasn't unacceptable enough no logical or legible information was given to us as to the reason for the delay other than the weather was too cold for the baggage handlers to work (even though it wasn't cold enough to stop planes from landing and taking off). The ensuing response from the baggage staff was unacceptable. Even though they were under pressure from many tired and angry passengers the Thomas Cook representative along with the Global Baggage attendants were rude and avoided giving any indication of when baggage would be available. There was no management of the situation evident and those that proclaimed to be in charge were wholly inexperienced in handling a situation such as this so much so that at one point they called the airport police to assist in quelling the growing anger being demonstrated by the crowd. All in all one more highly unacceptable experience within Manchester Airport. Given the amount of footfall through arrivals in terminal one it should be expected that there would be back up plans should there be problems of this nature. To keep already delayed passengers waiting and uninformed many with children and small babies is at best an amateur effort at situation management but in my opinion it is an affront to customers who have paid considerable amounts of cash to travel and expect a minimum level of customer service way better than that demonstrated.,1.0
1310,Flew Emirates which now leaves from Terminal One. On departure I was disappointed with the rude security staff. Don't mind being told what to do as long as it is done in a polite manner but this was severely lacking. Had to pay a pound for 2 plastic bags to put toiletries in and these bags are given free in Terminal one so a lack of consistency here. On my arrival disappointed at having to pay a refundable one pound for trolleys. I'm not sure what visitors would have made of this having arrived from Dubai where such amenities and even pushchairs are complimentary as it should be at any major airport. Needs to improve if it has ambitions to attract other major carriers.,2.0
1311,Disgusted with security check in staff. I appreciate there was a backlog from previous days problems due to inclement weather but passengers were treated like cattle! I have never been so disgusted with fellow mancunians employed at the airport. I suggest Manchester Airport enrol staff on a customer care training course - they did not speak to passengers they bawled at them as if they were stupid. I travelled to Zurich and was so relieved to arrive in Switzerland where people are treated as human beings and given support with their travel plans.,1.0
1312,On arrival all UK passengers with new passport being directed to e-passport however only 3 of the 5 machines working so ended up slower than the human channels. It does work well though if the equipment is ok. No disappointment as usual regarding lifts to parking - only one working. Manchester never really pulls off professionalism.,3.0
1313,My daughter arrived at Manchester from NZ on 7th Dec 09 with two children and six items of baggage. New there was going to be a problem when passengers coming through were complaining that they had to be given pound coins by kind UK based passengers. On arrival at baggage collection with children my daughter couldn't get a trolley because you needed a pound coin! where does a foreign traveller arriving in UK get a pound coin for use at baggage collection. Unhelpful staff compounded problems which led to tears and eventually a trolley was found. Manchester Airport still haven't answered my email.,1.0
1314,T2 with Qatar Airways to HKG. Both flights on time. Afternoon departure: busy terminal 5 minute queue at check-in cleared security within 5 minutes as queue was short. Early morning arrival: cleared immigration 15 minutes after landing despite a long taxi from runway and several long-haul arrivals. Bag on belt 5 minutes later. No air bridge on return short bus ride to terminal. Terminal mostly clean and tidy but toilet cleanliness could be improved. Staff polite and efficient throughout. Valet parking remarkably good value at £39.99 for 9 days.,4.0
1315,Appallingly stressful security arrangements long delays and herded around by surly staff. Plastic bags for a pound - a rip-off. Should be free considering the enormous airport taxes we all pay. Customs officers intimidate passengers as I was yesterday apparently randomly selected and put through the most intrusive interrogation about my movements (at a wedding) and even as a non-resident pensioner having to detail what my last employment in the UK was over 15 years ago.,1.0
1316,T2 early in the day so few passengers but security still slow as no-one could go through while previous passengers being wanded/hand searched. Some additional employees would solve this.,3.0
1317,Queues at checkin and security can be long but it moves so is tolerable. Immigration is always quick when I arrive here. The shops and restaurants are extortionate so these are best avoided. The staff are friendly and enthusiastic. Some areas look a bit dated now but there is renovation work going on.,5.0
1318,T1 overall a bit better than last time - which isn't saying a lot. Only one lift working in T1 multi-storey car-park. Ground floor check-in for Swiss/Lufthansa worked well; new security area in T1 seems to have shaken off the worst of its gremlins. However the exit from T1 security right into the heart of shops shops and more shops is a nightmare - fortunately we weren't pressed for time but if you were then trying to pick your way through crowds of people aimlessly milling around looking at stuff they don't need would be v trying! The departure piers remain as dire as ever with multiple murky ups and downs brought about by segregating inward and outward flows in a place that wasn't designed for it. Baggage return very slow.,2.0
1319,T1 to Dublin. Fairly quiet Saturday night and everything went smoothly. No problems though I find T1 rather dark and unwelcoming. Not somewhere you would want to spend several hours in transit. Return had to be bussed from Aer Lingus plane even though it had stopped right next to terminal.,3.0
1320,The various terminals at Manchester are improving some quicker than others but at least all are doing so. The big issue remains traffic congestion as Manchester still has roads closed after the Glasgow Airport incident and unlike other airports still closes the roads rather than invest in suitable deterrents. Traffic congestion for drop off and pick up ability is therefore greatly hindered.,4.0
1321,T3 late-morning flight to LHR with bmi. Arrived in the car park 60 mins before departure cleared security 10 minutes later. Flight called soon after. Boarding pass scanning before security works perfectly and saves time. Usual friendly but efficient staff at security but the X-ray machines seemed to be working slowly on this occasion - queues of pax were not particularly long so it may have been a machine fault? No problems at the gate quick boarding. Overall I'm getting the impression that things are slowly getting better at MAN at last - each of my recent flights has been slightly better than the last and I really hope this continues.,5.0
1322,T2 if you check in online very little queue for bag drop. The new security upstairs was excellent. T2 was undergoing a revamp and it needs it. The terminal has been showing its age for while. I choose to fly from MAN as it is local and find the staff friendly. If you are expecting an airport like Singapore LHR or Hong Kong you are not going to have that experience. If you want a good regional airport then Manchester is great.,5.0
1323,Would agree with the recent positive reviews of T3. Security seemed to be free-flowing and efficient with plenty of staff to direct and assist. Longish walk to departure lounge but the lounge itself seemed to be less congested than when we last passed through 2 years ago. Slightly puzzled by the numbering of the gates but the signs are easy to follow. Return passage was equally easy though passport control was slow: only two desks open but this was at 4.00 a.m. on a Saturday morning due to a 6 hours' flight delay. Used Shuttle car park and bus transfers and the system worked well.,4.0
1324,Return BA flights to LHR from T3. In the terminal 2 minutes after leaving my car as a bus arrived almost immediately. Fairly lengthy queues at bag drop but processed very quickly by efficient staff. 5 minutes to pass through security moderate queues no problems. Extremely busy Saturday morning with multiple departures so very little vacant seating available and huge crowds but all the cafes/bars were open so I found somewhere to sit eventually. Friendly/efficient service at the shops/cafes I used. Flight departed on time. Upon return bags off the belt 10 minutes after landing in a full A321 and back in my car about 15 minutes after landing. Overall a much better experience than some of my recent flights from MAN.,4.0
1325,This was my second time using it and while it's been spruced up it somehow managed to get worse rather than better - my experience is limited to Terminal 1. Transport to and from the airport to the city centre was quick easy and cheap by the train. Staff at the airport train station were helpful. What really gets me is the design of Terminal 1. The area before check- in made me want to get through security immediately; dark dingy and depressing. After check- in I found myself in what appeared to be a bright massive department store-come-shopping centre. Anything that might suggest the presence of aircraft and boarding gates were missing or lost amongst the neon glare of perfume counters and tobacco signs. I saw a young family who were obviously about to miss their flight frantically ask another passenger in the airport for directions to the gates because the entire terminal was designed to encourage as much transit shopping as possible and no thought was given to the fact that people actually had flights to catch. Confirmation of flight boarding gates are not announced until the flight is about ready to board so unlike almost every other airport I've ever used there is no option to just relax at the gate as you wait for your flight. The other downside of this is that if there's been a delay to your flight which there was both times I flew out of Manchester there's no one to turn to because the only staff around are shop assistants.,1.0
1326,Have used Manchester T3 twice in past 3 weeks and found both experiences to be positive. The revamped security area can be negotiated quickly and the selection of shops is fine for what is basically a domestic terminal. Although the central food seating area always appears busy there are many quiet areas to be found nearby with plenty of seating and a nice view of the runway.,4.0
1327,Pleasantly surprise by the refurbished terminal 1 - smart and clean with many food outlets; sufficient seating but could be more if they removed some of the thousands of square meters of shops which no one seemed to be using.,4.0
1328,Just flown to Olbia (Sardinia) with Jet2 from T1. Was dreading it having seen some of the recent reviews since the recent revamp and was pleasantly surprised. Check in was very quick as was passport control and done with a smile and good humour! My only grumble is that herding everyone through the duty/tax free shop is a blatant and clumsy way of trying to persuade passengers to part with their hard earned. It had the opposite effect on me and I think that this should be reviewed. All in all a nice departure.,4.0
1329,Just used Manchester T2 departing to and returning from Newark. T2 was a very pleasant experience. Uncrowded. Good choice of shops cafes and restaurants. Security very efficient and pleasant. Check-in very easy. Clean toilets. Good covered walkway to the train station. OK the architecture wouldn't win any awards and the carpeting in the immigration hall is truly nauseating.,4.0
1330,During check-in 2 separate flights (Varna & Bourgas) were bundled together on the same 3 desks! Never in 20 years have a seen such a circus. A family held the line for 40 mins arguing over 7 kgs extra luggage. Staff was very slow the boarding card machine broke. People on the later flight were allowed to cause delays for those on the earlier which we nearly missed! Complete chaos and lack of customer care! I am writing a letter of complaint to the airport too but legal action was only narrowly avoided! Next time I will drive the extra miles to Birmingham.,2.0
1331,Beware when using prepay car parks. We booked and paid £54 on the internet then proceeded as instructed using the same card to enter and exit the car park. It wasn't until we received our credit card statement that we realised we had been charged Â69 on exit. It is 2 months since our return and we have still not received a refund due to atrocious customer after care. Everyone we have spoken to has given conflicting information and have been uncaring. It wasn't until we completed a survey from Manchester airport online that they have taken any notice offering a 20% discount on any future parking. The airport is dowdy and depressing very few areas to sit or eat. Very disappointed with the whole experience.,1.0
1332,MAN/BSL on Swiss. Check in fine and transit through security also good. The walk through the shopping arcade to the departure gave the opportunity to buy a litre of Pimms for £11.99 (Â£10 in Morrisons that week !). Departure lounge restaurants offer Carling lager for £3.75 a pint - almost £1 pound more than the normal pub price. Very dirty bar floor staffed by people who didn't seem to care - but sadly that's service in the UK these days.,3.0
1333,I have been using Manchester frequently over the past 15 years. Overall it's getting worse although with the recent addition of many more screening points the security queues are much shorter and efficient than the previous horrendous experience. Check in (having used many different airlines) is usually OK. As with any airport if you want to avoid long lines arrive early. In Terminal 1 beyond security I hate the way one is led through a maze of perfume stalls before reaching the departure lounge. I don't mind airport shops but not so 'in your face'. It really creates the wrong impression. They've avoided this particular folly in Terminal 2. T2 business lounge (mostly use Sky Team - KLM/Air France) is very small but adequate if not busy. Arrival experience is variable. Long delays in getting off the plane are common due to no one to operate the air bridge/no one to drive the mobile steps/no buses waiting when parking remotely. Queues at immigration have lengthened over the years as on average has waiting for the baggage. If using the long stay car park and pre-paying on the internet to avoid the extortionate on-the-day charges the part where you are supposed to insert your credit card at the entry barrier doesn't work. Instead call them at the exit barrier when you leave and quote your reference number. My card was charged correctly after this. Overall the airport looks shabby doesn't operate particularly well and can't really be called a pleasant experience. The managers should pay a visit to some Asian airports to see how an airport can be run.,2.0
