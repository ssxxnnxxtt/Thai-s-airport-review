0,"Arrived Heathrow on Oct 22, 2022, on British Airways flight 675 at 10:20AM. Transferred to Terminal 3 by bus to catch my American Airlines flight. Bus driver was surly and unhelpful. Entered Terminal 3 through security station 6. Absolute worst attitudes of any security personnel I have encountered anywhere in the world. First person I ran into in the line to the security point was a man who spoke poor English and screamed at passengers who could not understand what he wanted us to do. I have never seen anything like it. I can't believe management allows this to go on. His directions to get ready for the x-ray machine were unintelligible and confusing, and then he got furious when we couldn't understand his poorly worded and unintelligible instructions. The x-ray operator appeared to deliberately slow everything down and likewise displayed a poor attitude. I was returning from a trip to Athens and Greece where the security personnel were pleasant and efficient. Not so London. In the future I will avoid Heathrow if possible.",2.0
1,"London Heathrow should be a level of Dante’s hell. Yes, it’s the worst and longest walk to connecting flights on the planet, but have you ever done it on CRUTCHES? I have. The second security line, the toothpaste in a baggie, the rude and surly staff, the elevators and trains and broken equipment, the whole nine yards. Naturally, the wheelchair I asked for was not at the gate. I asked for a wheelchair from someone, and was told I didn’t have time. I guess I did have time to hobble three miles to gate 47, though.",1.0
2,"My elderly mother who cannot walk, was left in the WC assistance lounge, which was totally mismanaged with very poor coordination. Despite reminding the staff multiple times that her flight was getting boarded and she needs to get to the gate to board her connecting flight, the staff was very rude, and had a laid back attitude. Eventually they dropped her to Gate 16, instead of her Gate 22, 20 minutes before flight departure, and causing her to hobble with her cane and carryon baggage to the correct gate, so that she would not miss her flight, making her the last person to board the flight.  I understand that some may use WC for convenience, however for a person like my mother who cannot walk because of recent surgery and medical diagnosis to be subjected to this type of behavior and attitude is totally uncalled for, especially as asked for accommodations to be made for her in advance. We are dreading her return trip through your airport.",1.0
3,I try to avoid transferring through Heathrow but this last time AA changed my flight via Philadelphia and rebooked me through London. This airport is as old and craggy as it was last time I transferred through here 10 years ago. Doesn't Britain have a power grid? They always seem to have power failures. I've traveled through third world airports with more sophistication. Never again!,2.0
4,"Terminal 2 arrivals awful. The staff were forcing incoming passengers to use the passport e-gates despite the fact they were not working,  insisting each passenger try several times to use them before allowing passenger to get their passport checked by a staff member, all making for very long queues.",2.0
5,"I arrived in T4, looks and smells old and outdated, its not changed in 10yrs+ I've arrived there. I breezed through passport control, which was great, but it took 1hr for my suitcase to appear. It's all done with lasers and computers, but this actually makes it a longer process. And because the passport control is slow for non UK residents, those passengers take ages to come through and their bags stay on the belts for ages so no new ones can come out. After 30hrs travelling, no one wants to stand around for another hour waiting. Me and a few passengers ended up pushing bags closer together to make room so the lasers would find bigger gaps so more bags would come out. I'm gobsmacked this terminal has not been updated in more areas. Seems to be a lack of staff.",5.0
6,Terminal 2 is pleasant enough. Plenty of food options and enough seating. The e-gates at passport control are a complete joke. We are a family of 4 and 3 of our passports were rejected by the e-gates. There were plenty of others as well in the same boat as us. I’m all for cost savings but at least come up with a fit for purpose service before getting rid of staff. Usual shambles at baggage handling reclaim as well but at least it was better than Toronto Pearson airport - damned with faint praise!,3.0
7,"Heathrow now charge £5 just to drive in, stop for 30 secs to unload passengers and then drive out. When we were dropped off the entire designated drop off area was 75mm deep in water. We had to push our cases through while wading behind, then sit in a plane for 7 hours in soaking, ruined footwear.",1.0
8,"I missed my flight due to some medical issues and I was granted by some vouchers of hotel. In going to hotel, Aqeel Ahmed the security manager, helped me lot for getting there and make me helped for coming out from terminal. I am really very thankful for his care and concern. Thank you so much",10.0
9,"Lets start off with the signage to return your rental car, or should we say lack of it. Check-in was easy as there was no queue. The same cannot be said for security which took 25 minutes to clear at one point absolutely nothing was moving. Again signage is bad as they have the newer X ray machines that don't require you to remove your electronic devices but that isn't mentioned so most people start to unpack only then to be told you don't have to. Once through, T2 isn't that bad the LH lounge is quite nice, there is room for improvement though.",5.0
10,"It was a happy day for me and my 2 kids, we was traveling to Kenya to visit my family, when we arrived I was told that my kids must have PCR test otherwise I have to cancel my flight. To make the matter worse, we didn't have enough time to get it done, I started to panic, talking with airport assistant but nobody could help, then I came across this beautiful lady, Rashelle. I told her all the issue and she assured me she will do everything it takes for us to fly, I trusted her, she made a lot of calls with my airlines (Rwanda Airlines) then she booked my kids antigen test, (all with her phone). After the test were booked, she had to run with me to testing point (holding my 7years old daughter hands and carrying her backpack) because we had only 30 mins left for the flight to took off. She rushed everything as quick as possible until we was in the flight. I will remember and bless this lady all my entire life, she came to a rescue where it seamed like there was no way, and more importantly she reminded me that, there are still good people left in this world. She just needed a huge hug from us as a payment.",9.0
11,Such a terrible check in and security experience - the queues are ridiculous. There seems to be more staff managing queue a than people actually checking in or conducting security checks. Horrific start to a journey - particularly when compared to arrival journey through several other airports. Would avoid if possible.,2.0
12,"Is this really an international airport? There were no staff to serve anywhere. Of the 15 lanes at the north checkpoint, only 5 were working. People were lined up in queues and the English whistled indifferently. No protection for the coronavirus. Flights were delayed because there were no staff to help park the planes and people to load the bags on the plane. The suitcases took over half an hour to come off the belt. Both departures and arrivals are sure to be delayed by two hours. Really unacceptable situations for such a large airport. Find alternatives if you want to travel through London.",2.0
13,"My son and I arrived from Dubai on the 19th July. Everything went smoothly till the flight landed in Heathrow at 8pm ahead of schedule. Had a 20 min delay to disembark due to ground staff shortage. Finally, we were collected by my husband from the car park at 12.45am, after a 4.5 hour wait for luggage. The luggage hall was full to the brim with passengers waiting for luggage and the only information given was that the delay was due to staff shortage and weather! I have seen comments from LHR chiefs that they do not have staff because the airlines are not paying a fair wage etc. At the end of the day, if the airline industry and the airports are to survive they really need to improve their service. After Covid airports want public to start travelling again but the way the airports are managed currently we will not be flying for the foreseeable future, which could be a good thing considering the way the planet is heating up! My recommendation for anyone arriving at Heathrow is to make sure they come prepared for a mini holiday in the luggage hall!",1.0
14,"My small child and I arrived on a late flight for a 12 hour layover in order to continue home to the United States. Upon arrival the staff instructed us to continue on to the “family line” to pass through border control. I was stupidly naive believing that the family line would be quicker and more convenient. I couldn’t have been more wrong. The “family line” was hundreds of parents, babies, and tired toddlers and one border control agent. On the other hand the line for non-families was virtually non-existent with travelers speeding through. After standing in line for nearly an hour that’s not the worst part. By far the worst part was the border control agent herself. She was beyond rude and hostile.",1.0
15,"Will never go back to Heathrow. We were traveling from Geneva to Seattle, via Heathrow. After landing at Heathrow, we proceeded to the International Departures area, which led us into a huge room fronted by a line of machines which read your boarding pass, and let you through into (eventually) a line to pass through Security into the departure terminals. This room was completely uncontrolled, no lines, no PA system, just complete chaos, as people packed the room. It turned out that Heathrow staff weren't letting people through the machines, as they shouted over the din of several hundred people talking, trying to get the people with the earliest flights to come up front to pass through. This was the worst organized area I've ever encountered at an airport. Simple improvement would have been to have actual lines, with a PA system or signs directing people to the lines for the earliest departing flights. Instead we stood packed together for over an hour while we slowly progressed towards the front. We won't do that again, next flights will transit through another airport, we won't be using British Airways, even though this wasn't their fault.",1.0
16,"We frequently fly through or to London and it has always been a challenge but today is an experience of unbelievable magnitude of incompetence, understaffing, deliberate indifference to serving their customers in a professional manner. Today’s experience included waiting in unimaginable lines just to get in the entrance to Terminal 3 of over an hour, another hour wait to get to security of an hour.  We grabbed a bite of lunch and watched an elderly man collapsed. the seats next to us and unable to make it to his gate. His daughter and granddaughter frantically trying to get help, find help or any airport personnel. None were found, those found either said they could not help, could not touch him or simply disregarded their family’s request and mine. Heathrow experience very disappointing",2.0
17,Fast Track closed. 2 hour queue for security. No social distancing. No assistance. Complete lack of any customer care whatsoever. The airport is not fit for purpose at the current time.,2.0
18,"London Heathrow disappoints once again - on arrival on a British Airways flight from Vancouver, I waited over 90 minutes for luggage to be delivered. Airport staff said baggage handlers were ""busy"" and to expect our luggage to arrive ""soon."" No apology for the delay, nor ETA provided. Arrival area of Terminal 5 very stuffy - no air conditioning, and no where to sit. Passengers had to sit on the floor or on luggage trolleys while waiting for the luggage to arrive. Departure from London Heathrow to Vancouver was worse - security staff were very fussy about the kind of bags used to contain liquids. Furthermore, at Terminal 5C, there was one Starbucks shop open. Considering this is where Airbus 380 aircraft - which can hold up to 500 passengers each - depart, this was woefully inadequate. Our flight was significantly delayed, and we were told, at around 8pm or so, that all food and drink stores at Terminal 5C had shut down for the night - so no food for passengers available. Staff told us it was not possible to return from Terminal 5C to main Terminal 5. As such, Terminal 5 is very poorly operated. This is not a world class airport by any means.",4.0
19,"Extremely rude security staff. I had a layover here and was made to go through security again (unknowingly) in which all of my items were removed from my bag, unorganized and thrown away while the staff member made unnecessarily rude commentary toward me. Would not recommend this airport and definitely will avoid in for future travel. Terrible experience.",1.0
20,"After arriving from Venice on a British Airways flight to connect to another British Airways flight to Pittsburgh, we had to wait in an interminable line of people to get to another line of hundreds of people to get to another line for security. We waited in line for over 2 hours and finally begged security to let us through or we would miss our flight. They were rude but let us through. Then we had to take a bus to the gate for our flight, we barely made it. My husband and I are in our 70's, we were exasperated as were all the other people waiting forever. Security could not have cared less who had to be where or at what time. I would not fly British Airways or go to Heathrow airport on a free trip. In all our years of travel all over the world it was truly the worst experience ever. Something has to be done about this system, you should not have to go through security again when you are transferring from one British Airways flight to another.",1.0
21,"Hard to believe that this airport could get worse, but it has. I will do anything possible to avoid it in the future, horribly long, mismanaged security lines.",1.0
22,"The flight landed at 4pm, I am writing the review at 6.40pm and I am still having one more hour at least in the unbelievably long queue of the borders. Adding to the pain of the 7 hours flight and 3 hours in the airport before the flight and at least 2 hours to reach my hotel. This unacceptable, absolutely ridiculous.",1.0
23,"Appalling treatment of passengers at Heathrow T2 this afternoon. It is clear they do not have enough staff to cope with passenger numbers. Either limit flights, have more staff (and not just inside the terminal ground staff too) or add additional gates for scanning boarding passes. There were customers zig zagging the terminal in out and back in again. Staff looked exhausted. Every staff member I spoke to had the same response ""not enough staff"" . After almost missing our flight we then sat onboard for an additional 90 minutes whilst ground staff scrambled to find baggage handlers. Then there was no vehicle to push the plane back. 2 hours delay.",1.0
24,"Very slow security and rude staff. I went through security and it beeped. Asked what they told me to and stepped to the side and waited. Another man behind me had to be shown aside. I waited a few moments and the security staff looked me dead in the eye and said “take your shoes off” I put them in the bin and she just looked at me. She said, “please do what we tell you to” I looked behind me and the man had to take his shoes off. But she was looking at me so I thought I had to take mine off. I said, “sorry I thought you were talking to me.” And she said, no with a smirk. Poor communication and awful staff.",1.0
25,Their quality assurance and professionalism is very poor. They beat around the bush for months only to close out a complaint we made. My wife was hurt in the bathroom and they never apologized nor refunded us for her first aid items. They are right at the airport to obtain a receipt yet wanted us to call all the way from another country long distance to ask for a receipt. They asked for it months later and never said anything in the beginning. They did this to avoid reimbursement which means they are dishonest. We missed our connection due to their poor service and bad workers who were extremely rude. We were rebooked on a flight which caused us to need a hotel at our expense. It took over 3 hours to get rebooked. We will never use their airport ever again.,8.0
26,"Ridiculous queues, chaos reigns in T2. Too few staff and no order or segregation for queues trying to get to automatic boarding pass check (scanning) machines. If only there was a way of knowing in advance how many passengers would travel each day?.  Boarding queues at lower Gates (A25/26) equally chaotic. As a frequent traveller and someone who has worked in the industry for over 26 years I find this inexcusable.",3.0
27,"I don't know why people criticize this airport. It's not the world's best but it's functional. Security was quick, it's busy but there is short walks to the gates and there is water dispensers. I don't care if staff are not friendly to me.",8.0
28,"First time flying from Heathrow and was apprehensive following all the cancellations of our trip caused by Covid and then the recent news of queues and delays. I had to need to be. We flew from terminal 3. Parking in short stay was easy with a short walk to virgin check-in. No queue at all, done in 5 minutes. Next to security, which I always dread. It was the best I have ever experienced. Staff were calm and courteous, no shouting or yelling instructions. Consequently the passengers were also calm and we were through in no time, not feeling stressed at all. We used the Aspire lounge, and found it a very relaxing place to spend a couple of hours before our flight. The staff were delightful and the food and drink good and plentiful. Our flight was called and when we reached the gate we were straight onto the plane. A brilliant start to our holiday, would not hesitate to travel from Heathrow again.",9.0
29,Terrible baggage service. Waited over 30 minutes for my bag to arrive as well as half of other passengers. Automatic identity check doesn’t work. Would have travelled through Gatwick if it was closer. Don't understand how they can’t do such a simple job of transporting the bags to the belt on time!,4.0
30,"Travel destination was Los Angeles from London Heathrow.  I cleared the main airport security pretty quick and patiently waited at the gate for boarding. The boarding started and eventually my group was called towards the end and as I walked along the ramp a young lady checked my boarding pass and said I was randomly selected for additional security check. The security check was quite thorough and detailed including pat down and item by item inspection. I didn't know I had the dreaded SSSS on the boarding pass and the Airline could have warned me. It would have made sense for the airline to have prioritized the passengers for the additional security check passengers so that the risk of missing the flight could be reduced. Also security staff who were from a contracting company should have been more communicative of what an additional/secondary security check entails, who or why it was ordered and what they were looking for.",3.0
31,"When Virgin Atlantic switched from Gatwick to Heathrow for its flights to Orlando I was originally quite pleased. It is a much shorter journey to the terminal building. Well distance-wise anyway. Pick-up drop-off by car currently costs £5 per visit. The roads are jammed from the M4 right up to the terminal. I am sure it took longer to travel from the M25 / M4 junction to terminal 2 that it usually takes me from the M25 / M4 junction to the North terminal at Gatwick. The check-in side of the terminal is packed with people and the standard of cleanliness and upkeep is vaguely reminiscent of a grimy 1970's British railway station. Once checked in and past security there is a shopping mall with some boarding gates attached. The restaurants are packed with lines of people waiting to buy a vastly overpriced meal (Captive audience I guess). The seats in the waiting area are reasonably comfortable but you may have to clean them yourself if you want to sit down. The whole area is noisy, packed with people, and claustrophobic with some of the worst lighting. The gates are small and cramped and ours didn't have anywhere near enough room for all the passengers on the flight. The aircraft was less than half full. Safe to say I hate Heathrow terminal 2 and all the garbage it makes everybody put up with. An awful ghastly place to be avoided if at all possible and only endured if you cannot avoid it.",1.0
32,"The most unfriendly, disorganized, and dishonest airport I've been to. Avoid flying here at all costs. Flying in, we were updated on ""new delays"" every 10 minutes, pushing us back 45 minutes, giving us only 30 minutes to catch our connecting flight. Then, when we did arrive, Terminal 5 happened. No posted boarding gates anywhere on the scrolling screens. We told the additional security screening personnel that our connecting flight was departing in 25 minutes and were told ""Everyone has a connecting flight, stay in line."" Only after security do they post the boarding gates, which unless you're lucky and get Gates A, you have to ride an elevator down 4 floors to catch a tram to Gates B and C. After which, you have to run up 2 sets of broken escalators. When we got to our gate, they had delayed the flight by over and hour and not posted it on the boards. When I asked why, having just run through the airport, was told that ""If we put up all the delays, everyone would be angry."" Spend whatever money is necessary to avoid this airport.",1.0
33,"The airport was fairly empty and BA check in was quick. The priority security was very quick and efficient, annoyingly the gate was announced very late and was a remote stand.",7.0
34,"Nothing works and the design of the Terminal 5 is a joke. The terminal can't cope with the number of passenger of an A380. The escalators didn't work, the journey in the terminal is endless.",1.0
35,"A complete mess. On arrival we waited close to an hour in border control and another hour to collect our luggage. On our departure there was not enough charging stations and our flight was delayed by over 2 hours resulting in many missing their connecting flights. While I understand Covid has caused a lot of issues, I do expect better of an airport such as this.",4.0
36,"Terminal two is so badly disorganised. Dreadful, horrible experience. Plenty of staff at check-in standing around but doing very little. Slow inefficient beyond belief. My departure gate B42 was quite a way away for which I was prepared. What I was not prepared for was having to queue and wait as there was only one operating lift going to departure lounge. Horrid.",1.0

38,"I went with my son for a trip to London, we were kept for hours, hundreds of people stuck because the machines were not working and there was just one customs officer who took ages asking people hundreds of questions while others were kept in line. The only answer to our complaints was: ""we have very few customs officers"".",3.0
39,Security is an absolute joke. They don’t allow you to keep your items together. They give you a bag to put all liquids inside and it must be sealed. Then they pick and choose what they consider a liquid/paste. They opened my makeup bag and removed one mascara but left the other. They make you throw away anything that doesn’t fit in their provided bag.,1.0
40,"Absolutely horrible experience while transiting. Arrived on time (actually a little earlier), bridge to the plane was broken and the airline staff took over an hour to find us stairs/get us out of the plane. The nearest restroom after exiting the plane was 10 minutes walk. Had to take a bus to another terminal and on arrival, I had to go through security. The lady at the security check was absolutely horrible and made me take out all liquids from my carry on from plastic transparent Ikea bags to move the containers with liquids to transparent bags available at the airport. She said that she will throw my liquids away if I don't do that.",1.0
41,"Poor Taxi pickup organisation at Terminal 3 Heathrow’s new approach to divert taxis to level 3 of the car park to pick up arriving passengers is causing long queues, congestion and frustration for arriving passengers. All passengers are required to navigate 2 different elevators with children and luggage. I waited with my family with at least 150 other people waiting for lifts to get to our arriving taxi. When getting to the pick up point there was further delays due to the congestion of around 20 taxis trying to find their passengers. More can be done to ensure a more efficient operation at the easily accessible forecourt.",2.0
42,"Heathrow T3 is not in the same league as Gatwick. Lots of seating but dirty with food crumbs or footprints. The shopping is ok but limited as are food offerings. The Curator Restaurant was the one redeeming feature. Lovely breakfast, fast service, friendly staff and reasonable prices, can recommend. British Airways in future at Gatwick until Virgin have a change of heart.",4.0
43,"I very rarely post reviews, however, I was looking for reviews about T5, to verify if others had problems with the 'Drop Off Zone' at T5 like I did. I had the same problem as reviewed below by Adrian Sharpe, I was looking for the multi-storey car park, and by mistake I entered in the Drop Off Zone. I did not stay, I immediately left the Drop Off Zone, and I found my way to the multi-storey car park. I parked and paid for my parking. To my absolute dismay I received a penalty charge this week, charging me £40 to have entered the Drop Off Zone. I am appealing this.",1.0
44,"The car parking company, Apcoa, is, in my opinion, operating a corrupt practice. I wanted to pick my wife and children up (having parked nearby). The signs are utterly inadequate and don't tell you what you are doing. I asked a policeman in the end because there were no staff. You are funnelled towards the drop off zone. The short stay car park is signposted off to the right but almost unnoticeable. When you go in the drop off zone you are on APNR cameras and liable to pay. There is nothing obvious indicating this (I physically got out and looked). 19 days later I got a PCN. I pointed out that I was in a drop off zone, was supposed to be elsewhere (the policeman told me this) and had then gone to the short stay car park as directed. They weren't interested and fined me. An hour and a half held hostage by parking, paid £5.30 and then had to pay a extra charge of £40. Add to that that entry to the UK was standing in a congested line for an hour with all and sundry.",1.0
45,"The worst experience! Upon touchdown we had to wait on the tarmac for about 10 minutes while the plane parked ahead of us tried to figure out what he was supposed to be doing. While transit through the airport and customs was a breeze (this was a first, usually takes over an hour), we waited for over half an hour for our luggage to start coming through on the belt. Meanwhile, we witnessed 20+ airport workers just hanging around joking and laughing like there weren’t hundreds of people across 4 flights waiting for their luggage to come through one conveyor. Nobody seems to care about customer service and everyone employee we encountered was rude and couldn’t be bothered to answer simple questions. By far the worst airport experience in my 30+ years of traveling. This airport should be ashamed!",3.0

47,"While not entirely painless, I had a pleasant and mostly easy experience. I arrived in the UK from the US, traveling internationally for the first time and was given helpful information from both staff and repeat travelers at Heathrow. Customs was very quick and straightforward, taking less than 20 minutes. I arrived and was picked up from the airport all in under 1 hour which is rather impressive for traveling internationally. Great WiFi connection, ample restrooms and seating and before customs all signage was easy to follow. Signage post customs and by the car park/pick up area was quite hard to follow, but I will possibly lend some of that to being American. I was frustrated by the amount of conveyers out of service, especially for disabled or elderly travelers. Lifts were also a bit tricky to find, especially for the demographics who need them most. Other than that, accessibility is great with many wheelchairs, trollies and services for travelers in need. Just be sure to take your time with navigating the pick up area.",8.0
48,"Arrived with BA0104 flight from Dubai. Going to the emigration area there was 2 employees who diverted me with my passport and Biometric Work Permit to the general (Rest of the World queue) There were around 300 people standing there, No social distancing, no attention from airports employees. Only 4-5 emigration officers were checking documents, air climatization is bad, people are getting tired, leaving the line for the WC visits and we are still not moving, 1 hour, 2 hours… you start looking at the other part where it’s dedicated to EU citizens. Why don’t you divert part of passengers there? Finally after 2½ hours they started to take families and give them priorities. It took me 3h15 min and I completed passport check in 30 seconds, officer never asked any questions just checked my Ukrainian passport and let me though. This is a pure disgrace.",1.0
49,"Terminal 5: Departure no problem, but dreadful queues on the way back - the Heathrow staff blamed multiple flights arriving at once, but with the skies less than full, this was a poor excuse.

50,"Hey Brains, I have an idea: why don't we charge people £5 to pick up passengers? We'll earn revenue from people who who aren't even travelling! Great idea, but won't that mean more people use the Short Stay car park instead and snarl up the lifts, cause extra queues and create even more chaos at Terminal 5, especially when some of our lifts don't even work?

The attendant was extremely helpful and polite, and explained everything thoroughly and made sure I had everything I needed to have for my arrival at my destination. Afterwards I went back to T5 to get a document signed. I had asked about it before and was told it could be signed if I came back after receiving my test result. I was a bit annoyed when I returned and they refused to sign the document. When I was going through security the staff was rude to me. I had started preparing my stuff in the line and was ready to finish unpacking my stuff once I could put my bag down. He kept repeating his instructions and did not give me a chance to finish before he repeated it again. I got very frustrated with him, which resulted in him being extremely patronizing.",5.0

Untrained staff who check no paperwork (locator and PCR), disorganised facility with very poor signage, everything seemed to be on a cost basis. Chaos. . Then we come to the long stay carparking. I had to alter the booking 2 times. No problem in extending and paying more money, easy to do online. When it comes to shortening forget it. The system won't allow. I asked for a refund by email, to be given a reply ""claim on your travel insurance"".",1.0
55,"Even though we are in the middle of a pandemic, I did not see any real changes to when I last visited Heathrow Airport last year in January. There was no enforcement of any of the covid guidelines set in the UK, or when there were some attempts at social distances they made no sense and were extremely redundant. When exiting the plane after waiting for the majority of the passengers to leave, I was approached by a very rude and hostile security guard. As I was travelling alone he made sure to speak with me rather than the family with two children (with no masks) walking behind me. I have taken the covid precautions seriously therefore I was wearing PPE (white disposable overalls, n95 mask, and face shield). The guard, sarcastically mocked if I were travelling to paint and then began berating me about how it is my fault that there is still a pandemic going on. Considering that there are far more people who flaunt their ignorance of the guidelines it is baffling why he was being like this about it whereas the family behind me was let off. Ridiculous. The border control guard, however, was the complete opposite.

As I was seeing my wife and daughter away to Thailand by government rules I was allowed to do. I proceeded to terminal 5 for my flight back to Aberdeen. Well I was in for more of a shock.

60,"First overseas trip of 2020 and surprisingly it was a very straightforward process through Heathrow Terminal 2. We arrived with 3 hours before departure but needn’t have worried. Travelling to Warsaw on LO282, our check in was completed online 24 hrs before. The check in area was quiet and we walked straight up to the kiosk to print our luggage tags. After issuing the tags, the kiosk printed paper boarding passes without any prompt - trying to save paper, we had already got our passes on our mobile phones. Would advise airlines to check if passengers need a paper pass at the kiosk. Once our luggage was tagged, we walked straight over to a drop off desk. In the past, there would be a queue, but given our early arrival at the airport, and the drop in passenger numbers this year, queueing wasn’t required. Tags scanned and luggage on its way, we joined the queue through security. Only two lanes were open, but the staff were extremely quick in moving passengers through. Before we knew it we were airside. From walking into the terminal to getting through security only took 20 mins. Obviously the main difference this year is the number of travellers going through Heathrow (or any airport for that matter). Airside was much quieter than we have seen, and one can only imagine the loss in revenue for the high end shops that cater to the wealthy passengers. We made do with visiting World Duty Free, then WHSmiths (always need some reading material) followed by a pint at the pub on the upper level. Naturally everyone is wearing masks and observing social distancing. My wife was disappointed that the perfume samples were not available - for me this was a major plus as I would usually have to wait ages for her to try different scents before choosing which to buy. Our flight usually departed from a B gate, but given the low number of flights, we were directed to one of the gates at the main lounge. Arriving back to Terminal 2 a week later was a little bit busier than before. To start off with as we deplaned, we had to show our COVID documentation (completed online 2 days before). Several fellow passengers had not done this so had to stand to one side and do it there and then. Our arrival coincided with a couple of long hauls from the Far East so there was a long queue at passport control. This wasn’t helped by only three e-gates being used. Just as I got to the front of the queue, they closed the e-gate! However, a member of staff was very good at getting three lanes down through the 2 remaining e-gates. I wonder how these queues will change once we end the transition period at the end of the year. By the time we got through passport control and walked over to the carousel, the luggage was just being brought out. From exiting the aircraft to leaving the terminal took 50 mins.",8.0

The can was clearly Powder, measured in grams and was on an outside net pocket of my backpack. The security staff, instead of just taking care of the can, they got everything out of my backpack, every single individual thing, including cosmetics that were actually in the bag on the tray, and put them directly on the incredibly filthy tray (exactly what I tried to avoid touching with my stuff). This was done at a very slow pace. Also my dad had issues with all his bags, instead of going directly to the problem, the staff touched and got everything out of the bag.

75,"Had just come off a 12-hour flight from Hong Kong and had to connect to get a domestic flight. We arrived at Terminal 5 but we were at the C Gates, so we were required to travel to the main terminal by train. It was around 5 in the morning and at least 2 flights had landed with a large number of passengers. There was only one train available that needed to take people back to the main terminals before returning to the C Gates and back and forth, so this took longer than expected. We were then required to go through security again however there were no signs or guides advising that we needed to do this. In some other international airports that we have connected, there is no need to go through security checks again. Because we only had 2 hours to connect, we decided we would try and head straight over to our gate before going to the toilets etc., but we encountered security instead. The queues were all over the place and you could see everyone was a bit fed up at this point. I had just come off the plane with at least 500ml of water left as well and instead of being helpful, I was shouted at for having a large bottle of water and was told to empty it on the spot by drinking it all (seriously?) or the security guard would bin my water bottle (was desperate for the toilet as well at this point). When we told her that nobody informed us that there would be security checks again, she shrugged and told us we should've emptied it in the toilets - obviously, I would've done that if I knew we had to go through this again! Overall she was incredibly rude, treated us as if we were stupid, put the blame on us and made our experience absolutely awful. If I had gotten her name I would've made a formal complaint. Honestly the worst airport I have ever experienced and would avoid in the future if possible.",2.0

First we have to go through the security check in Helsinki and get rid of all our drinks, buy water, drinks and even a bottle of liquor at Helsinki. Arriving after a 2.5hr flight at Heathrow, with 90 minutes to change flights. First you need to go through exact the same security check as in Helsinki. Security staff yelling and threatening people to listen to them or else they will be delayed. Here you are as a parent trying to get your family to another plane for a nice and stress free vacation. Unfortunately I forgot to take 2 iPads out of my bag. A simple mistake. The security staff took my bag (and several other bags of “criminals”, including an old English lady who clearly had difficulties understanding the instructions) to put it aside for at least 15 minutes before eving looking at it. The bag and iPads now needed some special investigation and it took another 15 minutes before I had my bag back. While I was waiting I could see several other people in the same situation, staff not trying at all to help the travelers, staff yelling and cursing at people for not putting the trays at the correct place. We had to run from the security check to the gate, me carrying a crying 3 year old, and a 7 year old trying to keep up. What a relief to make it to the gate and meet the incredible nice and friendly staff of British Airways. I feel bad for them, but I will never fly again via Heathrow. We had plenty of alternatives to fly to Miami, but thought Heathrow was a world class airport. Oh and the glass bottle of liquor I bought at Helsinki airport tax free and had with me in the flight to Miami. Not a single word to get that through security.",1.0
81,Departed from LHR T2 to Bangkok in October (evening). The check in for premium passengers was hassle free and security check was super efficient. In fact I've never encountered long security checks in any of the Heathrow terminals. It's one of the most efficient security I've been through. Once passed security there were plenty of shops or sitting areas with charging facilities. The terminal was clean and airy. On arrival we were connected to jet bridge in no time and was out of the plane very quick. Early evening on a Sunday with multiple wide bodied planes landing resulted in longer immigration queue. However the queue kept moving fast and most of the e gates were in operation. From landing to clearing immigration it took me less than 25 minutes despite the busy landing time. The only disadvantage or slightly negative experience on T2 is the long walk between the main building A and the satellite gates B (where most long haul flights depart/arrive). You have to go down and up on long escalators.,8.0
82,"The rudeness of security staff is unbelievable. One tells you to load your contents one way, others want them laid out differently.

83,Traveled in and out of Heathrow four times this year. Most recently on Terminal 5. It's a good airport. I don't understand the complaints about this. The security queues are quick and painless and the self service bio metric check on arrival with the machines work well and I'm out of the terminal into the underground within 10 minutes of landing. The toilets are well maintained and the prices of food and drinks with the variety means there is choice for all price points. The negative is lack of seating throughout the terminal as nearly all the space is taken up by retail shops.,8.0
84,"Worst airport for two reasons. Firstly, the security staff I encountered are very rude and unhelpful. When they try to check your bags, they do it at an incredibly slow pace that's literately maddening for anyone trying to catch a flight. Secondly the immigration queues are extremely long and counters are poorly staffed, normally people have to wait for an hour or so to go through immigration which is unbelievable. One time for a complete 15 minutes interval there was not a single staff member serving at the counters, not a single one!",1.0
85,"I absolutely despise this airport, not because of their layout, though it's rather complicated and time-consuming to get around, but because of the staff running the security. For the second time now, the last time was about 5 years ago and I swore that would be the last time I went through Heathrow, but security seemed to find yet again a way to cause me to be within minutes of missing my next flight. Both times my items breezed through the scanner, but ""I"", who had no metal objects on or in me, had to be scanned twice, and held to a very aggressive body pat-down. They even used two hand held metal scanners to search me and couldn't find a thing. I'm wearing a cotton shit, jeans and socks, no shoes. It took them well over 15 minutes to perform this abuse of power, and for a reason, I have no idea of. These people are truly messed up, I despise them and hope never again to have to go to that horrible airport again.",1.0
86,"I have been on a series of wide ranging business trips and now have new found admiration for Heathrow having used it at least 20 times in the last 4 months. The main thing is it realises it is an airport with shopping not the other way round. Inbound the connections from Domestic to an International can be made in 20 minutes - I have to do it at least twice on Sunday evenings as my flight has been delayed. The signs are clear, the 5A to 5B or 5C shuttle is effcient and never seems crowded. I have access to BA First class or Concorde lounges but have tried other lounges and bars and they all seem good (one in T5 beside the domestic gate lounge is very good at serving rapidly). There are loads of snack type outlets but it doesn't stink of food everywhere. On arrival the e-passport gates and security works very efficiently and I am not sure fast track actually delivers very much. Shopping is very good and I can't fault the terminal cleanliness. Two issues stop it getting a 10/10 - firstly if you are on a remote stand it is a very long bus ride and the buses are not very good, and secondly the have too many slots so if you are on alate out say 21.00-13.00 then you are going to spend a lot of time at the gate or in a queue.",9.0

British wit and world famous repute for good education and common sense is no where evident as we queue in dingy surroundings, eye sight gradually deteriorating due to faulty blinking fluorescent lighting, somehow no money forthcoming from the coffers of the wealthy British Empire for a replacement tube. Rows and rows of happy holiday makers after enjoying gentle British hospitality, cursing the somewhat hostile system of tax refund, obviously aimed at discouraging visitors from claiming what is rightfully theirs, in a cunning, sneaky, unfriendly, money-faced manner. Having travelled extensively, contributing to the healthy economies of a large number of countries, I can safely say this tax refund system and premise to be the absolute worst, even surpassing Paris’s CDG many times over. Common sense dictates more counters required for expeditious service, better ventilation (!) in a bigger area, toilet facilities, seating areas for the elderly and those with children and properly functioning lights (basic requirement!). This system of screwing visitors is keeping the economy afloat in a most underhanded manner. How disappointing that we leave Bonny ol England with this impression and what a put-off!",1.0

Queuing times are efficient as they take into account the intense amount of passengers that go through the airport, just not the planes, you'll be waiting 10, maybe 20 minutes waiting to take off, possibly missing a connecting flight. Seating wise, the seats are quite good to rest on for a person who lives quite far from airports. The food is fatty but really tasty. I expected so much less from an airport like this.

Extra security took forever. My colleague wasn’t able to put all her toiletries in the small clear plastic bag they provide. The bag has to fully close and hers didn’t, thus extra security warranted for her. After going through the extra security, she had to dump the things that didn’t fit in this ridiculous small bag.

114,"The bag check in is now automated which means there is no one to help. Waiting in line to try to figure out the system by ourselves. Took a few tries. Stressful. Then the worst security experience of my life. I was pushed, hurried, shoved around, roughly searched. They took off my prescription glasses and I couldn’t see anything to find the buckets that held my phone, handbag etc. The search was brisk, invasive and there was no one polite enough to help me after they were finished with me. I have never felt shocked and distressed in a security check before and there was no one behind us, so there was absolutely no need to shove me through.",1.0

Nobody sees to care about the customers and travelers passing through here, they just don’t, it’s obvious. This is my last trip to the UK. Good riddance Heathrow.",1.0
116,"This airport is a disgrace. As a UK citizen entering from the US and transiting to Manchester, we arrived in T3 and had to wait about 10 minutes for an operator to attach the airbridge. Once attached, we had a lengthy walk (about 15 minutes) to get to the UK Border and immigration check. Signage was OK but limited. Having been scanned at the ePassport barrier, I thought I was through and into the terminal proper but I was immediately confronted with another bank of scanners and bar code readers - no explanation or instructions. There was an unhelpful and surly security guard who stopped me from walking around these scanners. He told me that I had to (again) remove my glasses and have my photo taken for ""airport security"" - why? I asked him when my data would be removed from Heathrow's system. He gave me the impression he had no idea why I was asking and then glibly agreed with me that it would be deleted when I left the airport. I dont believe it for a moment. Given the recent court case about facial recognition software, where is the policy statement from Heathrow about the usage of our data and how it is protected/deleted? Once through this barrier, another lengthy walk to a bus gate for a long transfer to T5. Why does Heathrow not have a skytrain connecting terminals? After our overnight flight, we were made to wait about 30 minutes until a bus arrived at which point, there was a massive queue of people. The driver of the bus was rude, just packing people into the bus and then driving at quite a speed around a maze of roads to get to T5. We were then confronted with another walk to security where we again went through the usual street theatre of security, overseen by an unsmiling security guard - welcome to the UK. Had I been a foreign visitor, I would not have had a good impression of the UK. Once through the chaos of security, the shopping mall which is T5 was crowded with very few seats available and throngs of confused looking people. Eventually, we got to our connecting gate where our pictures were taken again before we were allowed to board. This airport is horrendous. Having flown in from JFK, I suggest that LHR management take a look at how a proper airport should be run.",2.0

I rarely ever complain, but after a 24 hour flight, I found it really unpleasant to stand for 2+ hours in the ""Non EU"" queue for Border Security Checks. Of about 18 processing stations, only 8 were staffed and sometimes as few as 6 whilst staff had breaks. There were 4 or more staff doing crowd control which seemed more than necessary. I have no problem with the processing staff who were diligently carrying out their work. There just wasn't enough of them rostered on and that's avery poor VERY POOR and needs addressing.

You just don't need this when you have many things already to carry. The number of the departure gate is not displayed until quite late. We found our plane by the registration and using an app. Seating at departure gate is limited and the boading of the flight was mixed up to say the least. Our return leg was even worse, Passport control was all but un manned there were a few advisors sending everyone to E passport gates and my 16 yo Autistic son was ushered off to another gate. I was allowed through but my son was rejected and told to go and stand in a queue in unaccompanied. I asked why and they said that he was under 18, my son should have been allowed to use E gates according to the heathrow website at the time. Again lots of e gates and photograph taking, no glasses allowed, no caps, etc. And gates not even in logical places. There are some very nice people in the shops but the passport control staff need to have their personalities re installed and learn their own rules regarding e passport gates.",1.0

There were two opposite queues, and both were long, 1 longer than the other. But it didn’t matter as we planned ahead our time (5 hours ahead) so we were able to pass security on time.

123,"30th Anniversary Rhine River cruise trip, from Amsterdam to Basel. Heathrow was our connecting flight both coming in and returning home. By far the worst airport experience my wife or I have experienced on 'every' level. We are AA Frequent Flyers with Global Security status as well. LHR had the single most unnecessarily invasive, rude, redundant and down right nightmarish security checks & processing of any airport (International or domestic) we've ever encountered. And this was merely for a 'connecting' flight both times wherein we never left the secure area! In fact upon our initial arrival we were so delayed waiting to land then gate docking that we nearly missed connecting flight and were rushed with ""expedited pass"" by airport personnel with small group others yet we were 'still' run through the most rude, confusing and inhuman security checks ever experienced 'just' to get to our connecting flight gate! Really? Barely made our connecting flight and had no time to even use restroom in between all this rush and harassment. Our second Heathrow experience (returning home) was if you can believe it very much worse! Words are not enough to detail that experience and it still literally gives me nightmares and anxiety. The airport security is staffed almost exclusively by employees who almost all seemed to 'profile' travelers and ""run them through the ringer"" in the most rude, abrasive, disrespectful and insulting manner. I have no bias against any person as long they do their job properly and with respect for themselves, others and the institution they represent. The airport itself is horribly inefficient beginning with the bus transfers from arrival to departure gate areas, continuing with confusing signage or especially instructions, and finalized by some of the worst airport staff we've ever encountered in all our years flying. Again this was 'both' times we had to go through Heathrow and experienced by others around us as well, not an isolated incident. Heathrow is a disgrace to air travel & travelers and the fullest example of everything that is wrong today with airports in general. It is quite a shame that Heathrow is meant to be an International hub for so many travelers and thus such a gruelling experience for so many.",1.0

127,"I have not been at Heathrow for many years, and I had to use Terminal 3 for a departure to New York. Not traveling on business this time, I was an economy passenger and I experienced this in such status. Basically, Terminal 3 is just a vast, overpriced shopping mall, crammed with every high-end store imaginable, with limited seating and limited amenities that I could see, e.g., USB charging ports for cell phones. One has to sit in a crowded, central seating area where gates are not announced until around 40 minutes before the boarding time. Once a gate is announced, it can be a 15-20 minute trek to a gate, even with moving sidewalks. And beware, there are very few toilets! The signs for the toilets take you on a yellow brick road kind of odyssey which can encompass a 10 minute walk through a maze of stores, unless I missed something, there is only one near the entrance to the mall after exiting security. There are no toilets near or at the gates, which, as I said, can be very far from the main seating ""pen"" so to speak. Also, the security lines can be long. When the airport web site states ""arrive 3 hours before departure"" there is a very good reason for that.

Compare, for example, how Terminal 5 flows with the clunky, Victorian-minded processes of Mumbai's Terminal 2. Back in the days when dinosaurs ruled, the departure lounges were boring places. You might find a duty-free shop where the prices were twice those on any high street and so one waited until called. I think it may have been the Brits who decided that people waiting to board were a captive audience and so now every airport makes every passenger run the gauntlet of the most inappropriate shops (How am I supposed to stuff an Aston Martin in the overhead bin?). I also suspect the airports, in league with the retailers discouraged passengers from going to their gates. If one is not in the mood to buy 50-year-old single malt or Beluga caviar, one must wait in a crowded hall where seats may be in short supply. Thankfully, Terminal 5 has broken with this practice. Well before a flight's gate is announced, the departure board lets you know the pier from which the flight will depart. The piers at Terminal 5 have ample seating and are much quieter.

This is clearly unacceptable when following an eleven and a half hour flight one has to wait such an additional length of time before starting the journey home. The baggage belt was shared by a flight from Beijing, and when we arrived at the designated belt, the Bangkok flight belt was still awaiting baggage. Even when it arrived, it was in dribs and drabs, the premium economy of course coming out first. Then the belt stopped for ten minutes and when it restarted, there were never more than a dozen or so bags on it at any time. The inefficiency of the baggage service must really create a very bad impression for any foreign visitors. On this trip, we could compare the baggage service on arrival at Bangkok (twice), Chiang Mai and Hong Kong. Although of course Heathrow is far bigger, the staffing levels clearly are not sufficient to operate the required service to a competent level of efficiency.",1.0

One security officer was even stating that ""since you didn't follow our directions, we are going to search everything in your bag"". This type of deliberate delay is unprofessional. These people already passed through security, and are unfamiliar with UK regulations. We were doing the best we could under the circumstances. In my case, after waiting 20 minutes, I was told my cough syrup had to be approved by a supervisor, but one was not called for the next 20 minutes (the flight departure time), so I finally just gave up and told them to keep it. They then rummaged through my bag and let me go. This last search, as well as the extra wait, was vindictive, rude, and frankly hostile. I expected better behavior from security personnel.",2.0

However when we arrived at the immigration area we had to wait in an incredibly long queue for 3 hours to get through with our NZ passports, while we watched other people go through the UK/EU side of the immigration area without having to wait in any queues. There were quite a few officials in purple jackets standing around talking to each other and not seeming to be doing anything, couldn't they have done something to help the many people waiting in the queue? To top it off, when we finally made it to the front of the queue the security guard who stamped our passport was incredibly rude and surly.

177,"London does not have a Value Added Tax deduction service. While stores may emphasize that VAT will be returned to you at the airport while shopping, this is not the case. The queue at the VAT return desk prior to check-in is two hours long, making it practically impossible to obtain VAT. No additional counters were set up to handle peak flow. The (unadvertised) VAT return desk after customs has a shorter queue, but one must remember to keep all their goods in their carry-on baggage, which is not possible unless one is familiar with the airport. This situation is extremely unjust (I daresay exploitative). VAT returns were promised as an incentive to shop, but the system was set up in such a way as to prevent such claims from being made. The situation could readily have been rectified by setting up additional counters for peak flow to limit wait times to a more reasonable duration of perhaps thirty minutes (to deter truly frivolous claims). This situation reflects poorly on the management at Heathrow Airport.",2.0

180,"Avoid travelling from LHR T2 if possible. Otherwise, allow around two hours to check in (digital) and drop off your bags (human operator) and around one hour to get through security, and that's on top of the two to three hours usually recommended. The system was shambolic and the process painfully slow. Infrequent travellers will likely find the experience quite stressful, while business class upwards seem to be processed without delay. As an infrequent traveller, I found the signage and directions inadequate - in the lifts when getting to T2 - which lift to use, what floor to get out on, what floor the lift was at, at check-in, there was no obvious signage explaining the universal queuing system or the need to get your own baggage label from a machine, the queue to drop off bags was very long and snaked around the place, so get a trolley - not only for your bags but for also for something to rest against! Security was impossibly slow. At one point, all the queues seemed to be full. The queue I was in barely moved until another machine was opened after asking three members of staff to try and speed things up. One traveller was overheard saying he had just ten minutes to get to the gate and was told he'd have to queue, which seems unreasonable when the facility to fast track some travellers exists. Surely this is not the kind of customer experience envisaged in 2014 when a representative reportedly stated that the customer would be at the centre of the terminal's design! Any investment in facilities matters little when travellers emerge from check-in and security stressed with insufficient time to browse the stores, enjoy a meal or even a cup of tea, not to mention use the bathroom facilities. On the other hand, nearly all the members of staff were terrific - helpful, courteous, professional and understanding. The problem was that they were too few. In short, many check-in machines, drop-off desks and security scanners stood idle and human operators were in short supply while customers lugged bags around a cordoned maze and queued for hours at both check-in and security. LHR should be able to do better than this. In contrast, Phnom Penh International Airport was very efficient, with clear signage. sufficient staff and quick processing through immigration and baggage pick-up. I rather suspect that LHR managers/decision makers should listen to and learn from the staff.",2.0
181,"Very disappointed. The priorities at London Heathrow are totally wrong. There is no attempt whatsoever to ease things for families right from the moment you unboard the train, right through passport control and until you claim your baggage. 1) All airports I can recall let you claim your stroller at the airplane. At London Heathrow not only do you no get that service but you don't even get it with the baggage. It comes out of from a completely different belt. My baggage came out from belt 5 and the stroller came out of belt 11 which is at the other side of the airport and of course I had to ask to find out. Worse still there are not staff to ask so that took an additional 5 minutes to find someone. At Zurich airport I was told it would come out with the luggage. 2) Passport control is virtually empty for epassports yet very crowded and run by 3 members of staff only for those who have to use the manual process, ie families, disabled and children. This begs the question as to who should get priority? Families with crying children who have perhaps just endured a potentially 12 hour flight or normal adults who can better cope with travelling or the disabled? Please think and get your priorities right like the rest of the world! 3) Baggage claim- please treat peoples' property with respect. The buggies were literally chucked around with one buggy visibly broken from lack of care when handling. I saw how they handled these at Zurich airport and Antalya. A dedicated member of staff picked them up and delivered them to the plane door whereas at Heathrow they were clearly not handled in the same way. Fortunately the broken buggy was not mine this time but it was mine last year. 4) The lack of staff is very noticeable. It seems the cuts are even visible at the airport. I wonder whether there is a lack of security staff too? I should hope not but it is likely to be the case. I think the management of Heathrow airport truly lets the nation down. It is a visibly beautiful airport, that is clean, big and respectable but is immensely let down by the very poor service and poor management.",3.0
182,"My wife and I flew into Heathrow yesterday after a 10-hour flight. We walked for what seemed like at least a mile before we entered a roped off sea of humanity in miserable, hot, uncirculated air indoors. I estimate at least 1,500 people were slowly moving their way through a human corral waiting for approval to collect their luggage and go on their way. Some of the most insulting and intimidating features were the signage, obviously cooked up by some right-wing PR-industrial psychology firm. Large ""UK BORDER"" signs seemed to say keep out near the front of the crowd. The signs gave the impression of a wall Donald Trump would have been proud of. I told my wife had I known this kind of treatment would be our welcome, then I wouldn't have bothered a stay in London. After well over an hour of this torture, soaked in sweat, we finally were herded up to the glass enclosed immigration man. There was air conditioning here. He lobbed off a series of rude questions that ended with what is the purpose of your travel. Holiday, I replied. How many days, the I-man asked. Three, I replied. Well that's not much of a holiday, he sassed. Well, we're off to France after that, I said. How many days total, he said. Ten, I replied. He then snatched our passports, loudly stamped them and gestured us on. Yeah, I whispered to my wife as we walked away, we'll spend more of our time and money in a real country.",1.0

All EU and non EU citizens were expected to queue together alongside small children (including our own) that are not allowed to be processed via the scanning machines unless they can do it themselves! Total chaos. When I asked why we were all queuing together instead of separate isles I was informed all the flights that were queuing were from EU countries but then I said we had Japanese and Indian passport holders in our queue as well as other International passport holders. The Border man said they must of been in the wrong queue then to which I replied well you have one man directing everyone into one queue there isn’t another queue! This is all down to funding cuts which leads to appalling processing services at our Border Control for U.K. citizens not much of a welcome home.,3.0

We flew into 5 and out of 3, with the reverse on our return flight. Everywhere you go there are throngs of people with few if any quiet areas. The really odd thing about Heathrow is that they have very small seating areas around the gates. On our flights I would guess maybe 50 seats for a plane that holds 200 passengers. To accommodate this, they tend to not tell you which gate you will be leaving from until 10-15 minutes before boarding. On our flight to Prague, the board indicated that the gate would be announced 10 minutes before boarding, but some of the gates in the ""B"" category were 20 minutes away! Luckily, ours was closer than that, but it seems like a strange way of doing things.",5.0

The directions for flight transfers were poorly signposted and a long walk away. Then we were delayed further by long queues at security. I always have small bag of about 4 toiletries less than 50ml in a clear plastic bag outside my bag which goes through security without delay and have never been stopped in my many travels.

190,"Terminal 2 is the newest Terminal in London’s Heathrow complex. Again, it is showing signs of being too small for its purpose. This terminal is exclusively for the Star Alliance group of airlines. Departure: Although we had checked in online, we had to join the queue to be checked in properly. That involved a wait for us of about 45 mins. Once through this, the security check, it was plain sailing to the boarding of the aircraft. Arrivals: It was a smooth passage through the Border controls until the luggage reclaim. We had to wait more than 60 minutes to get our luggage. There was the new smart luggage carousel. It would only dispense an additional bag on to the belt when there was a free slot. It came to a point where the belt was full and no new bags could be dispensed. Presumably, the delay was because passengers were held up by the immigration procedures. These existing bags on the belt were presumably from passengers who had been delayed. Surely, someone in the planning department would have thought of a hold up in the chain (i.e. seizure of the flow of passengers) and no bags were being collected from the carousel? In this case, is the latest technology the most suitable route to take? It was certainly frustrating to see the same bags going round and round and no new bags being added. A large crowd of passengers was waiting and venting their frustration. Eventually, the bags were being removed by the delayed passengers and the new bags dispensed onto the belt. We finally got ours after a wait. Our usual time to go through Heathrow is usually 1 hour. This time it was 2 hours. It was a disappointing experience in Heathrow’s latest terminal.",6.0

Queues were incredibly slow and the staff were rude and looked like they just didn't want to be there. I don't think they understand customer service. My mother got yelled at for not knowing how to use the passport scanner to get through, she understands limited english and the staff member who stood there (which I assume is there to assist people) tutted at my mother and rolled her eyes when I asked if she could assist my mother. This made me so angry. Why were they even there if it was such a chore to assist members of the public? Ridiculous. Security queues are long and slow and you can understand why, because staff members don't care.

The short term car park lifts are all operated by the usual up or down call button but it is very difficult to see which one of the several lifts actually arrives unless you stand well back which makes for a mad rush by everyone to the set of doors that open. Inside the lifts there is a very poor screen showing which floor the lift has stopped at, it seems to be some type of LED sign that you cannot read unless you are at exactly the right angle so most lift passengers have to call out and ask ""which floor now?"" The departure hall has many screens showing which check-in zone etc but the exact extend of each zone is unclear, is this queue in C or D etc.. common sense says it would be better to colour code seperate zones and where are the toilets, I could not see any signs in departures other than a single unisex cubicle outside by the car park lifts and nobody around to ask. In the arrivals hall there are signed toilets at each end and they were clean but what a stupid type of hand-drier, there are ""wings"" on each tap at the individual sinks and once the washing has been done then the water stops and hot air is blown downwards. Novel idea but unfortunately all this airstream initially does is blast the remaining water in the sink upwards onto the unsuspecting handwasher, why get rid of the functional wall mounted driers used successfully throughout the world? Finally - on each floor by the lifts there are 4 payment machines but this lunchtime two were broken on level 3 so both remaining ones had a long queue, this just happened to push me (and probably others) over into another hour and an extra £3+ are our computer systems so bad or is this a discreet way they make more money?

We have just under 2 hours to make our connection after landing from Portugal before going to US. To change terminals there is a line you get in. You have non compassionate, non conforming people managing the crowd. We were sent to a room for American Airlines customer service. They said for document check. What, you ask, we just came off an international flight. Then we realize the customer service only wants to help those who need to rebook. Luckily, we caught a girl and she said we could go get in line for security to go to terminal 3. The line is over 500 long. We ask one of the purple staffed hall crowd controllers about moving to an express line before we miss our flight now in 45 minutes. She said no worries, they will rebook you! You have to wait! I said I don’t need to be rebooked if I can move up. She repeated no problem they will rebook you! So we wait and go through security with folks, they all want different things. Take your shoes off, leave them on, no take that off. No consistency. Afterwards, we see gate departures. We see our flight is closing under status! My 70 year old mom is not that fast. I take all her stuff and run to the gate to try to hold it for us. We get to gate, there are 5 others flushed from running. My mom makes it and they pull us for another pre flight bag check!

Checking in: This was done at the desk, the old-fashioned way. I did not notice any significant number of automated checks in counters. Perhaps I missed it. Going through Security: Now that Heathrow Airport has got their act together with regards to the process of getting passengers through security screening quickly and painlessly. They have invested in more screening bays and people to do the work. We got through security easily and without taking off our shoes. What a relief. We then went to the lounge. There were plenty of branded shops, but we have visited them so many times so we gave it a miss. Boarding Process: It did not seem an orderly process. It involved a full flight for a super Jumbo A380 of about 500 passengers. Malaysia Airlines boards by seat numbers with the passengers at the back going in first. The point being, there are people who can see that the boarding process has started but they do not know exactly what is happening. There is no obvious signage or clear audio announcements to inform passengers the exact situation. Because they are not sure of the announcements, anxious for more information about their situation, they moved to the front. As a result, the area around the boarding area is packed with people. This full plane load of people blocks the main hall where other passengers have to cross to catch their respective flights. This is not a very civilised manner to board a plane in a modern-day airport. Malaysia Airlines should have clear signage to show exactly what is happening. Say this is where to queue for rows x to y etc. in contrast to the mayhem when I was boarding.",8.0

The secondary screening process is a time consuming joke - it took the inspector over 12 minutes to check the knapsack. During this period, the segregated luggage started to back up. Not at any point did a supervisor add an additional inspector or help speed up the process. The woman who helped me told me that ""this happens all of the time"".

On 17.01.18 we tried to pay by debit visa card in a few different places and floors to finally work out that the machine does not accept pin numbers but only accepts contactless payment. How would I know this if the error message says Visa Debit not accepted? Have been in the airport 15 minutes and spent another 20 minutes running around and trying to pay for the car parking which made me stay over 30 min and therefore more money to pay!,5.0
209,I was transiting from Amsterdam to Boston through T3. Security staff were very rude and unprofessional. Just yelling at everyone one like it was a boot camp. No respect whatsoever. Your only allowed one small zip lock of liquids under 100mls. When I asked why I was able to carry the same amount of liquid from Amsterdam I was told people in US and other countries don’t do their jobs that’s why. I had NyQuil caps for cold and they were thrown away considered liquid in a capsule. I almost missed my flight just as I spent 45 min for someone to recheck my liquids. Unless there is no other option I will never transit though UK. Worst experience ever!,4.0

I was forced to use the last position to place my stuff in the grey trays as two others were before me. For some reason there was a hold-up for a few minutes, then the process proceeded. Two more people came in to fill the gaps left by the two before me as I was stuck at the back of the queue so I tried to push my two trays left in the gap before the two newbies could push in but the security guard shouted at me to stop pushing. I told him I was before the two newbies but he denied this by barking at me in a very rude manner. As my trays eventually went off I told him there was no need to be so grumpy. His eyes were blazing. I would suggest that people like this with absolutely no people or customer service skills are not suitable to be dealing with the public.",7.0

Airport is really modern and security is fast and efficient.

The departure lounge is a disgrace for a terminal primarily operated by long haul airlines. It's literally a big room with shops and eateries around it, full of seating in the middle.

I'm a seasoned traveller but I've never seen anything as haphazard and disorganised as I experienced on 8th November 2017. My hand luggage went through the scanner and was selected for further scrutiny, fair enough, that happens from time to time. However the staff at security then seemed to be at a loss as to what to do. It took ages for someone to actually decide who should actually do the physical check of the bag and how to do that that check, it was laughable to watch them. It was more like watching the Keystone cops than airport security staff. Once they finally go someone to step up to the plate and do the check I had to turn my bag out myself and then everything was taken away for checking. On finding nothing it was then given back to me for repacking with no space to do that. Amateurish. I don't have a problem with additional searches, they are to be expected. I do have a problem with security staff who have no idea how to perform them, it gives me little faith that they could actually find something in the event of there being something there to find. When I returned through Rome airport the following week the Italian security were a model of politeness and efficiency.

Of course queueing time could be cut but the passengers who still don't know - despite all the signs and the fact that this has been going on for years - that liquids of 100 ml or less need to be put in a separate sealed bag etc etc. But mostly it's just something we have to get through before boarding. Wi Fi seemed OK once signed on. On return was in Upper Class so first off of the plane.

Once through you are greeted with an overcrowded terminal with thousands of passengers everywhere. Toilets were completely overwhelmed even in the BA business class lounge you had to queue, top tip is go to the A gates on the lower level as the toilets are hardly used. Everything at the airport is so expensive and even the exchange rates are a rip off if you are changing money. T5 in the morning especially Monday is to be avoided as it's just too overcrowded with hardly any seating to be had and that includes the lounges, a huge need to install more toilets at this terminal is a must!

I suspect they're even worse when you go through Fast Track - making departing from there a real unpleasant start to the journey 8 or 9 out of 10 times. The worst we've had was a tattoo covered 'gentleman' who just used his body to boss us around without saying a word, even when it was unclear what he wanted and when he finally spoke, he made a snide remark about my companions dreadlocks, who complained directly to Heathrow to no avail, until he twice prompting a non-committals answer but still no apology, making one of Britains' worst airports in terms of customer relations and treatment (worse than London City, Gatwick, Luton, Stansted and Birmingham for sure).",1.0

Why, for example, is it necessary to go through a complete screening process when simply making a connection at Heathrow. Are other airports deemed so slack that such is necessary? The scanning agent thought I was trying to smuggle liquids on board. I showed her that they were creams, which she accepted. That did not deter her from going through all my luggage for no apparent reason whatsoever, save the suspicion of liquids, which she had already determined to her satisfaction were not liquids at all. She even did a chemical screening. The couple in front of me had a similar experience. All of their articles of clothing were spread about, again after a suspicion of liquids, again immediately disproved. This is absurdity.

At Heathrow T5 it was the total opposite, staff looked miserable, nobody smiled and there was one security chap actually shouting at a traveller in bag inspection before final entry to T5 and they had to suffer this verbal abuse in front of everyone getting screened. The security guy was young 20/30, and was shouting at the traveller to push his tray into XRay machine, he shouted several times at him and even said “push it in, its not rocket science”, I could not believe what was happening. This was approx 7.30am Sunday Oct 15, so everyone at security had travelled in early hours or like myself 15+ hours and through the night. Everyone was tired and then they are subjected to this - a far from a good Welcome to the UK”. Totally disgraceful, Heathrow you have a lot to learn about working with the public. I did see one good security person and he was helpful and understood, but the majority staff did not appear to care. Heathrow is supposed to be the gateway to our country and should show respect and be pleasant to travellers and not treat them like cattle.

236,"Arrived 8/9/2017 on the BA red eye from BOS to Heathrow for layover en route to Greece. Had meticulously sorted and packed 8 prescriptions (some topical, some oral, some nasal) into regulation plastic bags with pharmacy labels clearly visible. One was a box containing a large tube of analgesic muscle gel that couldn’t fit into regulation bags, requiring a larger one. Here I was, a mobile and alert, cooperative 65-year-old Anglophile woman with somewhat complex medication needs, carrying legal and medically necessary drugs in her handbag en route to a vacation. Thus I presented a serious risk in the minds of 2 security agents, who in turn rummaged through my meds, taking the topical ones out of pharmacy boxes to inspect and run electronic wands over for 20 minutes, seeking bomb-making materials, while advising me that all 8 meds must fit into one regulation plastic bag—that I could throw away pharmacy boxes so they’d all fit. This seemed an episode out of Monty Python’s “You Can’t Win” game. I refused as their suggestion would defy the laws of physics, damage some containers, be confusing as some meds had to be used in certain combinations, and eliminate prescription labels containing dosage directions attached to boxes. How, I asked, would I explain to other agents, upon my return from Greece via Heathrow, such medications with no labels to prove their contents? The agents agreed with this argument but managed to lose one prescription bottle entirely and jumble everything in their zeal to protect the UK against American grandmothers and music teachers.

On the way out I was astonished by the range of shops after passing security and by how clean the place was despite the number of people passing through it.

We were called to gate 10 and were then ferried to our Qatar Airways plane. Should have been BA but changed due to the strike. A good experience. On return this is with BA we took off on time and were given a 2 hour flight time. We then circled the Thames estuary for 35 minutes Heathrow traffic was the culprit. When we eventually landed we then sat on the apron for an hour as there weren't any free gates apparently because of thunder storms. When we did get a gate we made our way to immigration just in time to see all the e reader get switched off, there were originally 5 or 6 working but they suddenly all turned red. When we went to baggage a sign was flashing saying 45 minute wait for luggage, thankfully we only had hand luggage.

All this took place whilst another customer ambassadors kept telling us that this was the only way in. Finally, they let us in. No apology and no acknowledgement of our existence, their faces drawn into a grimace, as though we had trampled on their consecrated tea break. We finally found our way by the use of signs and arrived at a closed door. A man was on the other end, telling us to wait. We wait and wait and wait whilst he has a general laugh with his colleagues on the other side. Finally he uses the card (around his neck) to open the door. None of this actually dampened my mood until we came across two women. To say that they were rude would be an understatement. After all the inconvenience we had already experienced, they decided that their best approached would be to demand our boarding pass in a tone one would use on a convicted criminal. Despite their disgraceful behavior, the request made sense. I offered my passport, with the boarding pass included. Being South African, I’m generally asked for everything. I thought I would spare us all the impending interrogation. To my surprise, not only does she sigh in frustration, but the moment we turn our backs, she looks at her colleagues and starts complaining. ""Why didn’t they just give me their boarding pass"", to which her colleague responds ""Maybe they don’t speak English"". My truthful feedback would be that a few our ambassadors should receive refresher training. If you plan on flaunting a title of customer ambassadors, you should make sure that you are worth of the title. The BA error must have been extremely frustrating for them, but that, by no means, excused their outright disrespect and poor service.",2.0
255,"Second time arriving at London Heathrow and 1 hour in the Border line (both times). An absolute disgrace. Plenty of empty immigration desks but no staff. The EU passport side was empty but ""the rest of the world "" spiralled out through lane after lane of traffic tape. As for the ""purple people "" Heathrow staff who seem to do nothing but scowl - what do they actually do? Once again by the time we got through our luggage had been taken off the luggage belt and stored by someone. If you can avoid this airport go anywhere but Heathrow.",1.0
256,"The archaic and entirely idiotic ""1 bag"" of liquids only slowed the entire process of security to a crawl. I watched staff running around asking for certain timed flights to cut to the front and entire families desperate to put travel size bottles (that are allowed in every other airport) into 1 tiny bag per person. When I asked why they had this rule I was told ""it's your fault for not looking at the website of the airport your connecting flight was routes through"". Customer service at this airport is garbage and I will never fly through this airport again, regardless of the cost.",1.0
257,"Customer Service is dead at Heathrow Airport: I had an hour to make my connection at Heathrow this morning. I did not have to change terminals, both my incoming and outbound flights were in terminal 5 and still I could not make it to the gate on time. I entered the ""Fast Track"" lane. Within 2 minutes I got moved, with others, to anther lane (non-fast track). As we are standing in line and others were complaining about the line not moving at all, I overhead the security staff member say to one of the traveling public, ""Fast Track does not mean you move fast"" - his words not mine! Finally, I got my bags on the belt for X-ray screening but my bag got pulled out for an extra security check and this is where the experience of abrupt, rude, uncaring security staff became most obvious. With a line of bags to be screened, I told the security manager 3 times I was going to miss my flight. ""No you will not Sir""! she insisted each time. As I ran to the gate, the bus was pulling away. BA attendants at the gate tried to stop the bus but were unsuccessful, but, they had no radios connecting them to the driver or anyone who could help. A colleague of mine made the flight was was to be on and 20 minutes after the bus pulled away the plane doors closed. I paid for a Business class seat and what did I get for it? The middle finger from Heathrow Airport. Airport management at Heathrow and around the world need to wake up and be reminded that we are ""customers"" not something you can take your own frustrations out on. We are paying your wages and it would be refreshing to see a little Customer Care. PS. The BA staff at the re-booking counter were very professional and did their best.",2.0
258,"This was my first time flying out of and back into the new Terminal two at Heathrow airport. Whilst I try not to believe the hype around the opening of new termini these days, such is the disappointment one usually experiences, I couldn't help but let my expectations rise just a little. Drop-off and check-in was fine. My travelling companion and I, both of us disabled, were directed away from the kiosks to a manned counter. We were offered assistance making our way to the gate but turned it down on the basis that we are both able to walk and that in any case we wanted to have a bite to eat ahead of departure. We were told however to be at the gate at least an hour before the flight in order to be boarded ahead of the rush of other passengers. At security it was frustrating to have to walk back and forth through the interminable queueing system despite the absence of a queue. One would have expected, on seeing two disabled passengers, that staff would direct us to a more straightforward route. The security process itself however was painless, staff were polite and friendly, and it was all done and dusted pretty quickly. On entering the departure lounge however, on checking monitors for our gate number, we discovered that the number would not be provided until 70 minutes before the flight, giving us just 10 minutes to get there. We enquired at the information desk as to whether they had any early information on the likely gate, and were told that we would have to find an airline desk downstairs, wasting yet more time. Instead, we wolfed down a passable dinner at the closest restaurant we could find before checking the screens again. One expects the walk to One's departure gate to be long at Heathrow. What was a surprise at such a new terminal however, was finding that the entire route to the satellite building is undertaken with moving walkways rather than any kind of transit system, such as at terminal five, Stanstead, and numerous other airports. I will confess that the escalator trip down to the subway is impressive in its scale, but a faster means of transport involving less walking would have been a more inclusive approach for all passengers. The remainder of our departure run smoothly, and we were on our way to Seoul almost dead on time. The most frustrating thing about our departure experience however was that airport assistance appears to be on an all or nothing basis. Either one waits to be ferried through the terminal like a lump of luggage, without the opportunity to eat or shop, or one makes one's own way but without any help in the shape of shortened cues, timely information or intra terminal transport. Walking distances aside, our experience on return to terminal two, two weeks later, was reasonably positive. We were ushered to the special assistance passport counter, and were through in a matter of minutes. By the time we reached baggage reclaim our bags were not only there, but had been stacked next to the carousel. The only irritation was chasing our tails around the shortstay car park to find the lane where our Uber driver could collect us. Whilst I realise that Uber is just one of many private hire operators it would be good if airport authorities could recognise the nature and popularity of this service, and provide a more accessible means of being collected. So, all in all, there was nothing terrible about our overall experience.",6.0
259,"Arrived at Heathrow Airport T2 just before 8PM, and the queues at non EU Immigration Control were unbelievably long. It took me an hour just to be able to see the front of the queue and the Immigration Control desks, only 2 were open, and it took me another hour to reach the immigration control desk, it was then I released that there were 4 UK Board control Agency officers standing there chatting to each other, oblivious to the queues right in front of them. 2.5 hours later, I managed to pass the immigration control, but by then, all the luggage had been removed from the carousel they were assigned to as new flights arrived. I managed to find my luggage amongst a mountain of luggage next to carousel 8. So, it took me almost 3 hours from landing to leaving the airport, and I was the lucky one, as I was one of the first to leave the aircraft, passengers from the same flight were still queueing when I went throughout the immigration control. The driver who came to pick me up told me this is not a one off but a daily occurrence. I think I will fly to Amsterdam next time and take a connecting flight into Leeds (my final destination), a small regional airport but seems to have more immigration officers (the last time I arrived there, there were 4 in total and I got through within minutes).",1.0

The immigration officers were chatty and friendly. There were plenty of good eating options and far cheaper than I expected of a London Airport. More than adequate seating areas. There's a great selection of hotels for an overnight stay, served by the excellent Hoppa shuttle service. Bus stations and bays are well sign-posted and easy to find. The security check was a breeze, even providing a nice area to pack your belongings after your stuff has gone through the scanner. Well done Heathrow!

From there we had a long walk to yet another bus to take us to terminal three - the second bus stop was literally metres away from the original bus stop. There were few actual seats on each bus, so standing was the only option. Once in terminal three signage was pitiful, and the toilets limited - more walking, no moving travelators, no toilets once at the gate. Security screening - the most grumpy lot that I encountered during eight flights. All in all very poor, in future I will travel via Amsterdam.",2.0

I then had a 15 to 20 minute slog to the 'B' gates. Once in the Air Canada lounge I could relax. Flight got called and left on time.

Sometimes they are really awful and being rude, but other times they are pretty professional and know what they are doing. UK Border Force have to be more friendly as they are the first image of British people that tourist will see. Immigration queue is usually long and take so much time. Queue on security when flying out is horrible. If a guy on front of you is caught on secondary check for bringing in a water bottle, takes so much time. If you caught in a secondary check, it takes ages for them to get you because usually there are lots of people getting secondary checks. Ground handling is really good. The immigration queue is already long enough that your bag would already be there. Tried some F&B, they are your standard London food and nothing really special. The seating arrangement before the checkin counter is really bad as there are no seats at all, but there are lots of seating, which are comfortable, after you clear security checkpoint. Shopping is too high end. Not a really wonderful airport, but better than others.",6.0
265,"As a UK traveller getting through Heathrow Terminal 3 was faultless. There was quite a long walk to immigration from the gate but, even at 7.30am when a number of planes were landing, I was through immigration in about three minutes. The bags then arrived at the same time I did in the hall and I was out of the airport within 20 minutes of landing. Absolutely brilliant.

266,"This review is specific to London Heathrow Terminal 2. We transited through one our way back to Canada. No real issues in regards to queues, relatively smooth, obviously some heightened security with everything going on in the world. Once through all the security checks, we took the bus from Terminal 4 to Terminal 2, the bus comes every 10 minutes so did not have to wait too long. After a lot of walking, which is not too bad since they have the moving floor belts, we got to Terminal 2. I must say this is one of the best looking terminals I have seen in quite some time. Spacious, lots of light, and lots to do. First of all, nice to see that Heathrow offers free wi-fi now. Terminal 2 is two stories, lots of seating areas, lots of shopping and a few coffee shops with some restaurants mixed in. There are a few private lounges as well, showers, an area that offers beds to sleep on if you have a long wait. I had a 6 hour lay over and I was able to pass time relatively easily. Definitely a nice change after having gone through Jeddah. Terminal 2 has huge windows so you can look out onto the tarmac and watch flights take off. Highly recommend this terminal.",9.0

As an airport you know when the flights come in therefore should be staffed enough to make it a nice quick experience for the people. If people don't think the British are grumpy they do now. This has happened twice in the last month I have waited over an hour and a half at passport control with 1-2 lanes open.

274,My first time from terminal 5. I have heard so many mixed reviews. Outward everything went really well and very quickly.

Even with immigration, luggage to collect and using off-site car parks, I have been in my car ready to leave 30 to 40-minutes after landing - excellent considering the size of the airport.

278,"BA's extensive route network make it an attractive airline to use to get to places. I am using them a lot. This review focuses on a situation that has been going on for years at T5 and it's unacceptable. This time I arrived from MIA at T3 took the airside but to BA's T5. There you are led through the rather efficient stages where someone confirms your connection then sends you up the stairs to go through security again. Getting to the conveyor belt is just a matter of waiting for your turn, it does move. The problem starts when your luggage will not come out of the X-ray machine directly to you, but is rerouted to endure secondary inspection. Luckily mine got straight through but I witnessed what I have seen time and time again. A dozen or more bags waiting to be inspected, very anxious passengers under a lot of time pressure and one security staff member that seems to take an extreme amount of time per bag to investigate, unpack, re-screen, repack etc. Just so painful to watch. These security staff members work unsupervised and there is not a thing you can do to express urgency, ask for sympathy or engage in anyway without delaying the process even more. It's is shameless power play with people under pressure, people that have been traveling for hours, may not feel comfortable, people whose bags come from a 'clean & cleared' situation (because they came directly from a plane and had been previously scanned). It is totally unacceptable and there is nothing you can do. My advice is to unpack anything that might raise concerns: batteries, small bottles, wires, computers, phone etc etc. put that all in separate bins. When you are about to start unpacking, peek over the X-ray to see if there is a difference taking the left or right scanning machine, the left may be empty for secondary checks while the right is all backed up. If you do end up for secondary checks, prepare for a delay up to one hour.",3.0

No way to tell which rep was from which airline. The instructions I was given weren't clear. As I raced to the gate, I checked the departure list and saw my flight was on time. Stopped by a customer service stand and asked them to contact the gate as I would be late in arriving. They informed me the flight was delayed for 30 minutes. I got to my gate as they were boarding. That experience could have been improved by better signs, clearer directions from BA staff, Airline reps having a proper place to address passengers . Updated flight information.

After a very difficult 17 hour journey it was a pleasant relief to find getting through at Heathrow was such a breeze. After landing at Heathrow I found clean and spacious washroom facilities before reaching immigration. There were drinking fountains I could use to fill up my water bottle. I then got through immigration very quickly using, for the first time, the self scan passport booths. There was a helpful member of staff there to assist which was useful as I put mine in the wrong way round the first couple of times. Then my baggage came off very quickly and the baggage reclaim area was clean and orderly and there were plenty of trolleys.

290,"Weekend trip to Edinburgh with British Airways meant flying from, and returning to London Heathrow Terminal 5. This is our most used route, normally travelled at least once a year. I had checked in online to minimise queuing at the terminal, and on this instance, had the boarding passes sent to our smartphones. Our flight, BA1454 was scheduled to depart at 17:30. We entered the terminal at 15:00, went directly to the Bag Drop (no queue at the multiple desks), then onto Security. Given the time of day (mid-afternoon on a Friday) the queues were short and we were Airside at 15:10. 10 minutes to drop off bags and get through security is near excellent. The departure lounge was crowded, but we made our way to the Two Rivers pub/restaurant. As it's a Wetherspoons, the prices are low and quality/selection of food and drink is very good. The only premium lounge at T5 is the BA lounge (as Blue members we aren't allowed in), but the Wetherspoons is the best alternative. After a quick bite, we alternate visiting the shops until our flight is called. As the gate is right by the pub, we wait until just before boarding to join the queue. Our return to Terminal 5 was equally quick this time. We deplaned at 16:59, walked over to Baggage Claim and had to wait a few minutes for the bags to start arriving on the carousel. There were only two carousels in this area (I am guessing there are other carousels for the international flights that arrive at the B and C gates). We collected our luggage and exited into the public area of the terminal at 17:20. All things considered, Terminal 5 is an efficient way of exiting or arriving to London. I think in this case we were fortunate with our flight times - in particular I have never seen such a short queue at Security. It is quite crowded and noisy in Departures however. There are many high-end stores, but none seem to be really busy. Staple airport favourites such as Boots, WH Smith and World Duty Free attract the most footfall. It's all very well having luxury handbags, jewellery and other high value items available, but does it really appeal to the majority of passengers? Travellers from certain countries may have money to indulge in luxury items, but I believe most would want a last minute memento of their holiday knowing they wouldn't face a huge credit card bill when returning home.

Maybe I just hit a bad day, but on the afternoon of my transit, staff was unhelpful, security just barely ok with cold approach. The transit hall is just too small and too crowded, packed with shops but less eating opportunities. There is not enough seating to accomodate all travellers. Perhaps the worst point are the gates, which are glass-fenced, so one can get into only when boarding starts, and once you are there, you are doomed - no shops, no toilets. Terminal 5, on contrary, is spacious, with plenty of seating, and one can sit wherever. Gates are not fenced and toilets are clean. Gates No.'s are announced only about 30-40 minutes into flight, which keeps people waiting in the main halls so they get crowded. Forget about comfort, privacy, peace, etc LHR is no such airport.

293,Used Heathrow T2 for my long haul flight to BKK. I haven't used T2 for a year and it has changed a lot - and unfortunately this is not positive. To avoid possible traffic jam I traveled from London on Heathrow Express. The station at Heathrow is miles away from T2 itself so it involved a lot of walking. That is understandable as Heathrow has few terminals. Check in was fairly easy without a long queue and most of the passengers are required to print out their boarding pass and luggage tag at the machines. The security screen was not well organised at all. So many machines were not manned during peak hours and we waited for at least 30 minutes in the queue. The staff working in the security screen were however very friendly. The main terminal area is clean and there are few shops - the choices not as good as T5 but if you are not into shopping it's not a main concern. When the flight was called we had to walk from T2A to T2B which was again a long journey. Arrival experience echoed departure. Long walk from T2B back to T2A and then faced long queue for passport control. I think the biggest let down of T2 is queuing time.,4.0

How it is appropriate to assign gates just 20 minutes before boarding when it takes that long to get there if you are lucky. Security lines are slow. Bathrooms need service badly and smell.",3.0
295,"What a horrible experience. I've flown through many airports, large to small, various countries, and security process and staff here at London Heathrow are hands down the worst. These jokers make the TSA in the USA look like speedy professionals. Every other bag in the connection security line (meaning all had been through security elsewhere), was being flagged for hand screening - with a guy moving the speed of molasses unpacking every single item, taking 10+ minutes per bag. Not a single word, just monotone bad manners and zero concern for the line of stressed out people in fear of missing their flight. My bag was packed identically to the way it's been packed on dozens of flights, including through LAX, Paris, NYC, etc only here was it necessary for a 45 minutes extra screening with no explanation. I will avoid this airport like the plague in the future. And all the items I planned to buy, nope. LHR gets a 0 from me, and zero of my money.",1.0
296,"I recently experienced Heathrow's new T2 The Queen's Terminal for departure. I was aware that Economy pax are required to self-checkin and print boarding passes and lugguage tags, only First and Business have conventional checkin counters. However, as I was travelling with Singapore Airlines in Pemium Economy I was directed to the Business Class checkin counter. So convenient. I was checked in and on my way in three minutes, saving the hassle of trying to decypher the lengthy process at the self-checkin machines, though I do understand they work well. I hope this helps others who travel Premium Economy on any airline, as I suspect this service is available to all. The process through security is much better organised at this new terminal with few hassles, unlike an earlier flight I had made departing from T3. The only downside to my departure was that, as the flight was on an A380, those large aircraft are terminalled at the satellite T2A, which involves around a 20 minute walk, especially hard for elderly pax, though there are travellators. All in all T2 is a pleasure to use.",10.0
297,"Heathrow claims to be a world class international airport yet this morning none of the 10 electronic immigration gates were in operation at terminal 4 at 5.30am despite the fact that my flight from Kuala Lumpur and 2 other planes from the Middle East had landed. The result was a longish queue for those with ""eu"" electronic passports to pass through 4 manual entry points. The explanation given was that they did not open until 6am. Most businesses try to deliver customer service in response to customer demand, i.e. If planes have landed and passengers need to pass immigration why are we not using the latest technology we have no doubt spent considerable sums of money on to provide a first class service when it is required?",5.0
298,"I am English and 69. Heathrow is inefficient, tiring, pedantic and the staff unacquainted with civility. I have used Heathrow 5 times since April 2016, every time an exercise in frustration and temper control, mainly from long queues and empty security bays. Staff know that they have the power to delay and inconvenience and that power is apparent and hovering to be unleashed. I have witnessed women older than myself treated with great disrespect and almost contempt because they were confused or not as nimble as staff want. It is the primary Gateway to London and Britain. What an awful welcome. The old saying 'You never get a second chance to make a first impression' is unknown by Heathrow.",1.0
299,"Draconian rules now apply at London Heathrow Terminal 4. You must clear security at least 1 hour before your flight departure because the security scanning computer will deny you access. When this happens you will have to go back to your airline check-in desk and get them to escort you through. Chances are, by the time you have organised that it will be too late and you will be refused access to the departure lounge. This happened to me and my 14 year old son. We were initially held up with a liquid security scan which had been set up before the security gates and we missed our Etihad flight despite Etihad staff coming from their terminal gate to try and get us through. We were travelling to Australia but that didn't seem to concern the Heathrow airport staff. Rules are Rules. This information should be printed on boarding passes because until it happens most people would be totally unaware of it.",1.0
300,"Flew to LHR from YVR: arrival at T3 on British Airways. Terminal 3 was ok - facilities a little bit dated. A fair amount of walking from aircraft to immigration. Queuing was reasonable and was able to get through immigration in about 15 minutes. During peak times, I can see the airport becoming very crowded. Baggage came out almost instantly upon arrival at the T3 belts. Departure from the new T2 - the new, sleak glass building is an improvement over T3. In the departure hall, there are only two restaurants. They were also fairly overpriced. Once airside, there are more shops, although they also are overpriced. Security queuing was ok - albeit with security staff who were borderline rude and aggressive. One must wait in the main terminal and check the departure screens to find out the gate assignments. For most long-haul flights, one will go down on a super long escalator, walk in a long underground passage, and then come up on another super long escalator. The process is quite tiring and tedious.",6.0

The airport terminal seemed quiet with few queues. We spoke to someone at Singapore Airlines to see what time we could check in, and also whether we could get a seat change because my husband is extra tall and larger than average build. The helpful lady told us check in would be 6 pm but that the supervisor came on duty at 5.30 pm and they would be the best person to speak to regarding this. In the meantime we went to Wetherspoon for a meal whilst we waited and the staff there were very helpful too. We reported to the Singapore Airlines check in at 5.30 pm and we were immediately passed through to a member of staff to try and make the necessary changes. She was helpful and put us in touch with a staff member who was helpful to accommodate us. We made our way through to departure which went smoothly. Whilst waiting for our gate to come up I noticed a sign for special assistance. The walk to the gate would have taken 15 minutes and my husband who has knee problems would have been ill walking for that amount of time so I approached the special assistance area and they arranged to take us to the gate on their vehicles. All in all a very pleasant start to our holiday.",9.0

303,"I've flown to and from Heathrow airport (particularly terminal 3) at least once a year in the last 6 years. The departure area is appallingly crowded, particularly where the food and beverage shops are located. It's the only airport where I don't feel comfortable enough to sit and have a drink before my flight. The overall airport isn't actually too bad with many shopping options before departure. As for arrival, it's almost always an unpleasant experience since 3 years ago when my university forgot to notify the border control that my student visa should be cancelled a year early. I'd very honestly explained that I'd be entering as a tourist (without requiring a visa) and not a student the first time, and my visa shouldn't be valid. On hindsight, I should've just lied. The friendly officer helped me put out a notice to change my status and let me through. However each time I land since, I've had to go through the same ordeal of being put in a holding area, unpleasantly treated and barked at like I'm trying to sneak in and stay on in the country until they verify whatever it is they needed to verify and grudgingly let me through. The whole process often takes over an hour without considering the long queues at immigration. The officers here are thoroughly unpleasant and inefficient and I wouldn't wish this experience on anyone.",3.0

I do not understand, however, how can a 747 (BA202) full of people be offloaded onto buses. T3 was beyond busy, which is expected. I tried to find a lounge to sleep, to find it only just before boarding, so I guess I was either too tired or the signs were not clear enough. The wifi also failed at times. I would suggest some kind of renovation on T3. I found it too crammed with some outdated areas.",6.0
305,"As a place, Heathrow has something special about it. No other airport I've visited has quite managed to grasp that sheer feeling of international wonder, the way Heathrow does. Call me crazy, but I really do love the size of the place. It adds to that excitement, knowing you are one of many - travelling to goodness knows where in the world. I love how beautifully modern each terminal is, even number 3 which is in obvious need of renovation comparatively to 2 and 5. Once through security, the place is practically a gigantic mall, anything you need - you'll be able to find. To be fair, for someone new to Heathrow airport, I can understand why the place may seem like a labyrinth, especially if travelling from one terminal to the next. As a Londoner, I practically know the airport inside-out, so for me personally that isn't an issue. Similarly, walking for me isn't really a problem - although I can see why for others it may be. Even if there may be more than your average doddle to the gate, the airport does actually tell you how many minutes away the gate is, which is quite useful. The staff generally are nice, of course at the border you occasionally catch the odd grump. They normally help you swiftly and are patient with fuming travellers. Queuing times are an issue, however. Be ready to wait a long time if you are an international / non-EU traveller headed to the UK. For me, baggage can often be a nightmare in Terminal 3, especially when they take such a long time to start loading the bags on. The only other bone I'd like to pick is with the WiFi. It's alright - but upon me making skype calls, it constantly stops working, or breaks up. Perhaps I'm being spoilt, expecting high-speed WiFi from the airport, but it's far too on / off and I never find any decent consistency with it. When I'm at Heathrow, I honestly am happier just to stay on data, it's way less of a hassle. I'm constantly in and out of Heathrow, but I'm happy to call it my favourite UK airport. Upon departure, the place always gives me that huge burst of energy and excitement - it's definitely something about the architecture and general ethos of the place. I also love the shopping features and terminal layouts. It's really a magnificent airport. Beware for baggage / customs waits, however. Don't forget to also have a space GB of data on you, as I find the WiFi to be pretty inconsistent.",8.0
306,"Used Heathrow Terminal 2 to travel to Warsaw with LOT Polish Airlines. Outbound departure was at 06:30. As I try to stick to a 3 hour check-in rule, we checked in at 03:45. There was some queuing involved at check-in due to multiple airlines using the same set of desks. However, we were checked in quickly and went to go airside. For an airport claiming to be a major international hub, and wanting to expand, Heathrow appears to open for business quite late. We joined a queue before security, and were told that security would open at 05:00. About 40 minutes later (and 20 minutes before Security opened), the single queue was allowed to become multiple queues. We watched as passengers who checked in 30 minutes after us, suddenly appeared ahead of us in other queues. At 05:10, we were herded through into the security area. The process of going through the scanners was quick (less than 5 minutes from joining the back of the queue to putting my belt back on). Once airside we were looking forward to buying some last minute gifts for family, and grabbing a bite to eat. However, the World Duty Free shop did not open until 06:00, and the food outlets were only just opening so we had a very limited amount of time before running to gate B33 for our flight. And no chance for breakfast. A long distance to the gate via down escalator, tunnel (with travelator) that runs under the taxiway and the up escalator in the satellite building. You feel exhausted and rushed by the time you arrive at the gate. At least the flight proved better than the airport experience. Returning back to Terminal 2 proved equally frustrating. Flight landed on time, but as the aircraft exited the runway (27L) at the farthest point from the terminal, it was a long taxi to the gate. After deplaning there was the long walk back to the main terminal, to join the converging crowds at passport control. As British/EU passport holders, we were instructed to use the automated booths instead of queuing at the faster moving manned desks. Given that about 1 in 3 arriving passengers had issues with getting through the booths, this process needs to be improved. In order for me to go through, I had to try twice (removing my glasses for the second attempt). The facial recognition software needs to be able to allow for glasses/headware etc. Otherwise real bottlenecks will occur. However, we got through and made our way to Carousel 4 in the baggage hall. The screen above the belt said the bags were arriving, and I was reunited with my case within a couple of minutes. However, after 40 minutes, my wife's case hadn't arrived and other passengers from our flight were also waiting. We asked an attendant who said that all the bags had arrived and should be there. Clearly they weren't so the group went to the enquiries desk. Another attendant said he would need to check ""downstairs"" and after 10 minutes said there was a delay with the baggage handlers but that the outstanding luggage would appear shortly. The flight landed at 21:45 and we finally got out of the terminal at 23:30. Not a great experience all things considered, and it does beg the question that if the airport is running at 98% operational capacity, how will adding a third runway improve the situation? I fly out of Heathrow not because I want to, but because of necessity (I work close by, so it is handy to get to). Compared to some other hub airports, Heathrow is vastly inferior.",4.0

But, unfortunately, we were faced with the longest queue at passport control in which we had no choice but to stand and wait in for over an hour. I cannot fathom how this airport functions and why it cannot process people within normal time frames like most other international airports. Yes, I get that Heathrow is a large and busy airport but do they seriously think that this is the way that people want to start their holidays? Border control staff look bored out of their minds and the whole process is nothing short of excruciating. I couldn't even log onto wifi to pass the time as it kept dropping out. When we finally got to the window the staff member wanted to make small talk with me and ask inane questions about my holiday. Seriously, stamp my passport and just let me go, I have zero desire to make small talk after standing in a miserable queue for an hour! There isn't even someone to usher forth those in line with young children, there was a family with a very irritable baby and toddler and they, like everyone else, had to just stand and suffer.

308,"UK Border control numbers in Terminal 4 were woefully inadequate for the number of arrivals. We arrived from Paris on time and there were several other flights that were either late or early that meant we had close to 1000 people waiting to clear Border control. It took 30 minutes to reach the ""45 minutes wait to this point"" sign and from there another 70 minutes to clear Border control. Less than half the control points were manned and 2 hours is totally unacceptable for this process. I lost my pre-arranged transport (but still had to pay for it) and then had to pay for a taxi. Heathrow get your act together. Looking back at Border control performance measures they have failed to reach their target of <45minutes for the past 5 months. I'm not sure why 45 minutes is the acceptable criteria. I don't think I have ever had to queue for more than 30 minutes at any major airport I have been through.",2.0

However, for other less experienced (or nervous) travelers, I wouldn't recommend an itinerary where you have to change terminals at London Heathrow.

I had a bad experience a few weeks ago on the 23rd of June whilst travelling with wheelchair assistance passengers to Tegal Airport Berlin. Both the outward and inward flights were delayed. Being a Bronze member and that there were no business class flights available, I asked if I and my disabled passengers could have access to the club lounge where they would be more comfortable as the delay was no fault of ours. The response was rude and unwelcome. I was told that if I wanted to use the lounges then I should have booked business class. Not the response I would have expected from a frequent and loyal user of British Airways. I tried to ask another member of staff but was redirected back to the same manager at business class check-in. The return flight was no better, this also was delayed and my wheelchair passengers were left in their wheelchairs to await the delayed flight. I know that British Airways have no control of assistance at Tegel airport, but the situation was even worse when we returned to Heathrow. I was the lead passenger travelling in a family group with wheelchair assistance passengers. When we arrived at Heathrow, the assistance offered was terrible. The driver of the buggy would not let us travel together as a family and wanted to split us up. I had to call a manager to resolve the situation but not before causing considerable distress to my assistance passengers. The assistance operative was very rude indeed and accused us of telling lies when we informed him that we travelled as a family on the way out. Not a good state of affairs.",1.0
337,"BA texted passengers that they were expecting Heathrow (T5) to be very busy, and recommended checking in online. Taking their advice, I did so, and gave extra time thinking I would be stuck in queues at security etc. I was happily surprised to find this was not the case. I sailed through everything in less than ten minutes, a very acceptable time for this. The airport was busy, but I filled my time with a little shopping, and enjoyed a breakfast at the cafe that has replaced the rather grotty pub near the domestic gates. It was a marked improvement. T5 remains a better experience than most terminals.",9.0
338,"It is only when you visit airports like Heathrow that you appreciate how truly awful other airports are. Only good things to say apropos recent experience at T4, including arrival - immigration cleared and bags delivered within 15 minutes. Customs well signposted - to claim back the dreaded VAT. Check in, smooth and hassle free. Security robust and efficient, but always handled with a smile. More than ample seating throughout the terminal. Excellent wifi. And refreshments at High Street prices - don't forget to say 'yes' when asked if your coffee and food are take away, and avoid the VAT!",10.0
339,Unbelievably slow security lane. One person took about 1 minute on average and there were 40 people in front of me so it took 40 minutes. Other airports usually take 10-15 for that amount of people. It wasn't even the security. The ticket and passport check to enter the security zone was slow. I'm not sure if they were just having problems with ticketing but I almost missed my flight due to this slow lane. And the transfer between terminals is a nightmare. Everything takes three times as much energy and time it would take in other airports.,3.0
340,"Where to start with London Heathrow - an airport that is so hopeless it makes hopeless look good. Took a flight today from Rome which was roughly an 1.5 hours and then took an hour and 50 minutes to clear customs. Queues (for non-Europeans/UK passport holders) was staggering and simply unacceptable. Took an hour simply to get to the immigration hall. Most distressing of all was to see the extremely poor handling of elderly customers and those with a disability. They were only allowed to use one gate and took even longer than the rest of us. When I got to the immigration officer and told her how we'd waited she shrugged and said that's the price you pay to visit a beautiful country. Poor attitude but somewhat explains the hopelessness. Low standards. Whole thing was inefficient and poorly run. The biggest laugh - Heathrow's slogan is ""Making every journey better"". The only good thing was the crowd spent so much time in the queue we started to bond. Whoever is in charge, get some tips from Changi or Hong Kong which are also busy but still run within acceptable limits.",1.0
341,"I arrived at C gates T5 at 23.25 on 12th June. Transfer was good to immigration, but that's where the trouble started. All e gates were closed, apparently they should close at 23.00 but opening was extended due to passenger load. This loading was still evident way after midnight. Finally cleared immigration only to wait another 40 mins for baggage to arrive. Tannoy announcement made that because the plane was so far away it would take an extra 15mins. The shuttle train from c gates proudly displayed that your baggage travels at 30mph but I guess that was not the case last night. Finally got the baggage and headed for the customs exit nearest to the underground only to find that it was ""roped"" off. This meant walking to the exit at the other end of the baggae hall in the opposite direction to that needed to exit for ground transportation. There should have been notices explaining that one exit was closed, but there seems to be absolutely no thought at T5 for the poor traveller. Exited to baggage area theough the half open door with a broken door closure. Headed for the Underground exit only to find that there were trolleys blocking the exit doors, again no notice to say that it was closed, no helpful note to say the the underground Station was closed, but there are buses to central London. I caught the N9 from the ""local buses"" stop. Do you really expect visitors to your country to expect a local bus to go all the way to Central London. Please please have some thought about visitors and help them, because at the moment the whole attitude seems to be ""couldn't care less"".",1.0
342,Purple parking at London Heathrow give the impression of a very professional car parking service with off site parking speedy transfers etc. The car park is very difficult to find and not very well signed either in or outside. The car park itself is in a horrific state and is quite some distance from London Heathrow. Transfers are as and when required. The ticket given to you when dropping off your car says to call them upon your arrival as soon as you get off the plane then the transfer will be waiting. I did this and was held on the line for 17 minutes at 3p a minute and had actually collected my bags and was outside the airport by the time someone answered the call. For the sake of an extra £10 I will be booking meet and greet next time and saving all the hassle.,3.0
343,"Departure facilities at Heathrow T5 are very good, plenty of shops, restaurants and bars all in close proximity of each other. Friendly helpful staff and very clean airport. Easy to find gates due to excellent signage and generally very good all round. Inbound is a different story, several escalators taking you both up and down to then have to wait 10 minutes for a train, which is more like a universal studios ride than an airport transfer. Passport control is ridiculous with nowhere near enough staff manning the desks, EU passport holders queuing for almost an hour on my last journey while non-EU straight through. Baggage reclaim area is very big with plenty of trollies. Overall I think BA have scored a bit of an own goal here and more thought should have gone into arrivals where the majority of people are tired and just want to get home.",5.0

345,"A ghastly experience at London Heathrow. Arrived from Boston and landed at 10.50am. We were travelling on to Glasgow and had a long layover. 1 staff member at the UK border was trying to deal with 3 queues at once - grossly understaffed and a complete shambles. Security was a farce. My bag was 'rejected' by the machine and was moved to join a queue of others to be opened and checked by one of 2 members of staff. One worked quickly and got people on their way. The other could not have gone any slower. My bag was'rejected' because I had not opened the amenity bag given to me onboard and had not transferred the tiny lotions to the polythene bag that they insist on. We walked into the Galleries Lounge at 12.15pm, exactly 1h25m after landing. The queue of people waiting to have 'rejected' bags checked was outrageous. An American couple beside me missed their flight because of it.",1.0
346,"My husband, myself and my twin girls (aged 13 months) were travelling to Lisbon and on arrival back to Heathrow we were informed that TAP (our airline) would only provide the buggy at the luggage pick up spot. When we asked for support from Heathrow staff we found the staff to be rude and unhelpful saying that there were many families standing in the line and they weren't able to help us. To be clear there were many families but all had two parents to one baby (twin parents don't have that luxury). We asked if we could have help with either our hand luggage, a temporary buggy, or a faster queue - we were told no to all of the above and to stand in line. Personally I don't understand why an airport provides assistance during departure when families have access to a buggy and yet no support on arrival when there are no buggies available. Overall a disappointing experience - this is in contrast to Gatwick who provided support on the way out and return. Also when I asked the Heathrow ambassador how to complain - the response was I don't know - I'll phone my manager. So helpful but ill equipped to provide any support.",2.0
347,"Heathrow Terminal 4 is a small, little bit dated, but friendly terminal, completely separated from the other terminals (1-3, 5) of Heathrow. It is mainly used by Delta, Etihad, Alitalia, Qatar Airways and several other airlines. It has a great passenger drop-off area for free if you arrived by car to the airport. When you arrive by tube, you must use several escalators to reach the Departures floor (or take an elevator).The escalators are a bit inconvenient because all are surrounded by bollards restraining trolleys, so you may need to lift up your larger piece of luggage. There are limited number of seating, shops and phone charger sockets in the departures hall.",8.0
348,"Horrible airport. Arrived from Basel. We had approximately one hour to find our plane. We had to transfer to Terminal 3. There were approximately 70 people waiting for small buses heading to Terminal 3. Buses were full and kept passing by because they were full. We were directed to another area to catch a bus at the beginning of its route. Traveled up and down and down and up escalators through long corridors. Finally found a bus leaving for Terminal 3 at the beginning of its route. Had to pass through security. Security staff were unpleasant, shouting at passengers and many were doing nothing but standing around. When we got to our gate the gate was closing. In the space of approximately 10 feet our passports were checked four times. Four times by people standing close enough to each other to talk to each other and see that our passports were checked. Awful experience. It was like getting caught in a maze.",1.0
349,"When flying to Europe I usually pass through LHR. LHR possibly has some of the best shopping. Their customs line is always long once you reach the terminal. Usually if you are passing thru and London is your last stop before heading back to the US. The customs line is long. If you fly straight out of LHR back to US the line is shorter for customs right by the check-in counters. Overall I think LHR after some of their improvements to T5 are really stepping up their game. I wish SFO would take a tip or two from LHR. Security is strict in LHR. You must pass thru security at least 1-hr before departure at least is the case when flying Virgin Atlantic. So if you are connecting be sure that you either purchase your connections on the same ticket or allow a few hours between flights in case of cancellations/delays/changes to departure time. I experienced a change in departure time. My flight was not until December but I purchased my tickets in July. Changes to my flights were made in September. My travel agency never informed me. If I would've used TripIt app back then I would have known and made adjustments. Moral of the story I missed my flight back home to US. I had to pay extra to change my flights for the next day plus hotel. It was my own darn fault but lesson learned. Positive side, extra night in London and excellent evening out. One of the biggest gripes for travelers are the airport fees. It is a shame.",8.0

BA lounge was understandably busy at that time if day, but I found a comfortable seat and enjoyed a bacon roll and coffee. Flight information was clear. Seating area at gate was plentiful.

I noticed a sign to 'register for faster exit' (using the Bio-metric gates) and have just accessed this information to find that you have to pay £70.00 per annum for the privilege of going through the Bio-metric gates. What a load of rubbish. Whilst I realise, and agree, that border controls have got to be exercised these queues are not acceptable, neither are the delays, and all it achieves are very disgruntled passengers and the ruination of a wonderful holiday (or business trip) spent out of the UK.

Airport staff, including the security, was extremely friendly. My flight left from T5C which is a short train ride from the main terminal. Flight took off with delay which is normal in Heathrow. Return journey after a long weekend was even better than the departure experience.

Speaking of which, barriers are used to control lines, yet there were numerous lines operating in the same direction meaning multiple lines were then having to funnel into one line. A blatently obvious error because someone hadn't bothered to adjust the elasticated straps on the poles to form proper directional lines. Additional staff in red uniforms situated just in front of border control posts at the front of the pax queue doing absolutely nothing. What are they there for? Border control posts - clearly not enough open and plenty of UKBF staff looking on chatting. Airports are not shopping centres.

All made worse by large volumes of purple jacketed jobsworths treating everyone like small children but doing nothing of any discernible use except make things worse. It's quite clear that passenger comfort and over efficiency has been sacrificed to save money and that whoever is in charge of the whole mess couldn't manage their way out of a paper bag. My suggestion-retrain the pointless purple jackets to operate the passport desks and open more than the 4 that were open this evening. Oh and persuade the half dozen border force personnel who were standing around gossiping on the other side of passport control to get behind a desk and do their job.",2.0

358,"LHR is the airport that I use up to 15 times a year. Such a large airport should be viewed as three airports, each served by a different tube station, and standard varies. The oldest, Terminal 1, 2 and 3, is old and in real need of renovation, even some redesign. The second, Terminal 4, is actually the most convenient, being not too large, and easy access to tube station is the key. Terminal 5 used mainly by BA is modern, and has excellent shopping and eating facilities. There are good lounges too (if you use BA, then note that the B Gate Lounge is much better than the A Gate North and South lounges). The convenient connection from LHR to every part of London is the key, and there are various means that gets you to your final destination in town. One complaint: they never give the gate number until about one hour before flight, and it can prove difficult to commute in such a large airport entailing a long walk or internal train transport. Wonder why they can't announce the gate number early, as most other airports do. This is its minus point.",8.0

There is no gate information, only terminal info, which is a problem for T5 which has 3 concourses. The signage varies between useful and misleading. The layout for the concourses in on the upper level show the layout for the lower level and signage is inconsistent for finding the concourses that require transit. The gate areas in T3 are adequate, while in the newer T5 the waiting area was inadequate for the A380 and BA's boarding procedure was chaotic. The departure display was never changed and there was an absence of regular updates. Somehow BA boards more efficiently and provides better information at IAD, which is no one's idea of a great airport. There were no charging stations and the nearest one served a bullpen of at least 6 gates.

One reviewer talks about not knowing your gate until 10 mins before boarding, and I have to rubbish that as wholly inaccurate.

I was concerned about the 2 hour delay as I anticipated the usual anxiety causing mayhem once at Heathrow as I would have to dash to catch my connecting flight to the USA. I was not wrong. Arrived at T5, then a train and a bus stampede to get to T3. Checking in at American Airlines was ridiculous. There were only 2 women serving a long line of customers. I was questioned as to what I planned to do in America. I have an American passport so excuse my surprise at this question. Then the dreaded security. I just hate going through T3 security specifically. I make sure I carry very little of the 'banned' items just to be able to get through without incident. Not this time. My hand luggage was pulled for secondary checks. There was 1 person manning this activity and he was mouthing off the whole way through. When I pointed out that I risk missing my flight, I got a loud lecture about how he was the only one working and that everyone there had a flight to catch. He suggested I go and beg for help at a little office in the corner. I did this and one woman reluctantly plodded through and started searching my bag. Nothing was found. One women who was trying to get to the same flight as I was, was willing to leave everything there just to catch her flight. One would expect Heathrow to have sterling service considering the size of the airport and volume of customers. I understand the restrictions and I applaud that safety is an issue, but do they have to do that with bad attitudes because they don't know how to organize their staff? I usually go for a long layover at Heathrow so I don't have to endure the snotty inefficiency at the security sections. I thought 5 hours would be enough this time - I was wrong.

378,"I connected through Heathrow's T5 - home of British Airways - in April. I connected from a domestic UK Flight to an International US flight. Upon arrival, we had to use air stairs and a bus. Due to a tight connection of only one hour, we received an ""Express Connect"" slip from some very friendly staff. I'm not sure what this slip does. We followed the clear signage to the Transit Hallway, we were going from T5A to T5C. Despite the mass of walking, we chose the hallway because the transit train was very busy. There was a good choice of shops and restaurants and the restrooms were very pleasing. We boarded on time with nice gate agents who assisted us onto our A380 flight to Washington Dulles. Definitely connecting through here again.",8.0
379,"As the flight ACC-LHR was slightly delayed, I missed my connection flight, but I was already informed of this on the flight, and my seat was rebooked to the next flight leaving just two hours after the intended, so no problems, and a very smooth and quick handling by the BA staff. LHR is huge, and transfer between terminals time consuming. E.g. transfer between Terminal 3 and 5 took about 1.5 hours including security check. However, the airport is very well signed with purple signs indicating routes, and bus service between terminals goes on each 3-5 minute. If you are an experienced traveller, LHR will cause you no problems, however, first-time travellers will find LHR enormous, albeit not chaotic. Many shops and restaurants in the terminal areas, even lower cost fast-food spots. Despite its size, LHR works well each time I have ben here.",9.0
380,"On outbound flight the ability to fly in from an Edinburgh  shuttle and go back upstairs to catch the next flight is pretty good. The trouble is that BA often schedules you on a short connection, so there is little time to enjoy the shops and restaurants. Most long haul flights go from the two satellite terminals 5B and 5C accessed by the underground monorail, which have a fairly sparse selection of shops. But despite all this I've had many bad experiences at immigration and security it's hard to dismiss it as one bad experience. First of all the ludicrous arrangements for flight connections - it is all too easy to go through the wrong immigration line and end up exiting to arrivals accidentally when you really wanted to go back upstairs to connect to the next flight. Immigration is a disaster due to BA assigning ridiculously short connections. People are called out from the passport control queues and physically moved to the front in a rather haphazard manner. Except nobody told UK Border Control who don't have enough desks in operation to accommodate the numbers of passengers to be processed. Why exactly do incoming transiting passengers have to go through security a second time, when they did so at their origin? Especially those (like me) who arrived via the ultra-strict USA airports. Would be OK if it actually worked efficiently. Firstly there is the so-called ""Fast Track"" line which is anything but because it only brings you into the massive bottleneck sooner (and it isn't really policed by anyone, incidentally, so any Tom, Dick or Harry can blag his way onto it and not be stopped....), and then the fancy automated X-ray machines. On no less than THREE occasions now I have had my Duty Free purchases automatically singled out and put in a queue to be scanned. Alright if they were quick and efficient about doing it, but on this occasion I stood and waited 15 mins whilst the staff  messed about; pre-occupied with arguing with irate and (understandably) frustrated passengers trying to make those ridiculously tight connections. There was no sense of urgency amongst the staff - I could only forlornly look at my stuff sitting in a tray alongside several others. One other couple in front of us had theirs confiscated because the bag had not been sealed properly at their origin and they proceeded to have a heated argument with the supervisor.  For somewhere that self-styles itself to be one of the world's premier hub airports this is nothing less than shocking.",4.0
381,"I was flying to and from Heathrow terminal 2. Terminal is new and excellent. There are lots of self check-in counters, as well as the regular check in desks. Waiting time was about 10 minutes, probably because my check-in time was around 5 in the morning. Going through security was as smooth as possible, polite staff and no unnecessary waiting. Departure lounge is amazing, with lots of shops, restaurants etc. I had to wait for two hours for my flight but that wasn't a problem at all. Flight was delayed for 20 mins, but due to heavy rain so no problems at all. Boarding was smooth and fast, and finally, only five minutes waiting time for take off.",10.0
382,"On arriving at Heathrow after a thirty hour journey, I fully understand that having to use a wheelchair I do have to leave the plane last. On leaving the plane I was shocked that I had to vacate the chair four times between the plane and the baggage area. I was placed in cold passage ways with no access to toilets or near any drinks facilities. Very few of the staff transporting me could not or did not want to speak English, and showed any interest in their job. On reaching the baggage at last, only to find our taxi driver was not there. On phoning his base in Louth (Lincs) we found him on his way back to the pickup area having been to one of the offices to ask them to tannoy for us. This they refused even after he told them that he had been waiting two hours and that one of his passengers was an eighty two year old gentleman in a wheelchair. This being the second time that my wife who is seventy eight years old and myself have been treated this way at Heathrow we will in future be looking elsware to find an airport to depart and return to from the UK.

385,"London Heathrow Terminal 4 gives mixed feelings. On the arrival, you can clearly see the current refurbishment efforts on-going. Immigration for EU citizens is swift, at the time (09FEB), the automatic passport gates were being renewed and all people had to be manually checked. Luggage delivery is quick in comparison to other airports, only thing is that the luggage loaders do not seem to know what priority tags are and how these should be handled. This is my fifth arrival in LHR T4 in the past year, that the priority tagged luggage is always delivered last. Onwards connections to ground transportation is a hassle - you really see and feel that T4 is no longer a focus for the airport operators. You have to go to either T5 or LHR central to be able to connect to most ground transportation  e.g. Heathrow Connect and Express services - it adds a significant delay and so far away from seamless intermodal travel. Departure at T4 is a quite efficient, being SkyTeam Elite+ member, the SkyPriority Check-in is swift and generally staffed by very helpful and friendly staff. The FastTrack sometimes can backfire on you, in particular in the evening peak. For the smokers T4 has an airside smoking facility, it is located opposite Gate 6..",7.0
386,"As almost everything in UK, this airport is a rip-off. Only overpriced or fast-food in plastic containers options for lunch. The airport is more like a big mall rather than an airport. Signs are contradictory, sometimes guiding you to nowhere. Rude employees ignoring my family when they tried to communicate with them in a language other than English, then, making fun of them because they can't speak English (of course they don't know I can, but I arrived later). London Heathrow is not an international airport, compared with Seoul Incheon Airport where they help you (or try to) in many different languages.",1.0
387,"I use Heathrow twice month (sometimes more) - this is usually Terminal 2 or 4 (but occasionally 3 and 5). I generally find the experience quite agreeable for both arrival and departure. The shopping and dining options are quite good - I don't really buy duty free but for practical items (toiletries, stationary, newspapers etc) I cannot think of a time I haven't found what I was looking for. It is normally quite easy to find somewhere to sit but there is not much variation in seating styles compared to many airports and this is an area I feel they could improve passenger comfort - I wouldn't fancy spending more than a couple of hours here. Immigration is usually quick for the EU lane and most of the time I use the automated machines which now seem to be more reliable. Security is the weakest element - not so much in terms of the queues and waiting times (which I've never found bad) but more the human element which lacks any real courtesy and friendliness. The staff attitude and dialogue is typically passive aggressive - particularly towards foreigners and just generally unpleasant. The number of bags being pulled for secondary checks seems to be ever increasing and there is no consistency as to why (I use an old-fashioned razor with a detachable blade and sometimes the blade is confiscated but most of the time it isn't). There is no efficiency or urgency from staff - during my recent visit there were 6 bags waiting for secondary checks with 1 staff member doing this whilst 7 uniformed security staff stood 10 feet away chatting amongst themselves - it is infuriating. Another bug bear is the Heathrow Express mobile ticketing staff that intercept unsuspecting foreigners on arrival and sell them overpriced tickets to what must be one of the biggest transportation rip-offs in our capital city. If you are not in an urgent rush, buy your ticket at the Central Station and take the Heathrow Connect stopping service which goes every 30-minutes to Paddington and only takes about 10-minutes longer - it's about half the price. I actually think it's good you can buy tickets whilst waiting for baggage but there really should be transparency about the available options - but I guess that's not in their interests.",7.0
388,"I like T5, but have increasingly been frustrated with the security there. Yesterday I arrived on BA (transferring flights) at T5, it was relatively quiet and with my fast track clearance joined the dedicated queue upstairs for security screening. All passengers in that line are both eligible for fast track as well as have been cleared already at the originating airport. With about 10 or so people in front of me, it took less than 3 minutes to get to the conveyor belt to have my belongings go through screening. So far so good. Then my bag was rerouted on to a separate track for secondary screening. With about 8 bags prior to mine waiting to be checked. I then watched for almost 50 minutes, the incompetence, rude attitude and purposely slow process of each of those bags being checked by one of the security staff. As frustration grew with each of the waiting passengers - now missing connections - the attitude of this security staff member grew worse and worse. I noticed that these staff members work totally unsupervised, seem to hate their job, finding pleasure in some terribly misplaced 'power game' ruining passengers experience and disrupting travel. Needless to say that eventually everyone passed this ridiculous check without any interference since all these passengers already had been cleared previously. Everyone understands the importance of security but this is totally unacceptable, the 'do not care' attitude by both security as well as airport operator is infuriating. Today, I did have enough time to connect to my flight but anyone with less than 1H30 minutes will miss his or her connection.",2.0

We were quite upset at the attitude encountered especially as we did not provoke it. As expected, the tested items passed all tests. Later on we unfortunately discovered that lids were not secured properly which wasted both medicine for our baby as well as his food. The whole encounter was very upsetting for us.

In fact, 5 of the passengers missed their connecting flights because the assistance staff were so disorganised. The British Airways staff who got off the plane were very apologetic but of course it was not their fault. Eventually we were fetched and ferried to A gates and made to wait again. I was eventually taken to the assistance waiting area at 7.45am. They fetched me and took me to my gate in good time.

As usual, the plane arrived over London in plenty of time to land, but was then placed in holding pattern for ages. We finally touched down at 7.30am and disembarked relatively efficiently. Then the fun started. First of all, UK Border control was evidently unable to cope with volume of arriving passengers. The Stasi-like airport staff barked orders at the arriving passengers. Someone was informed not to take pictures of the queue - never mind the fact that the pictures were being taken in the hall leading into the passport control area and not in the hall itself - because the queue seemed to snake about 100 metres outside the hall. When passengers finally arrived in the hall, half the automated gates seemed to be giving trouble. A couple of passport control officers were having a nice chat between themselves (at desks 1 and 2) as they evidently couldn't be bothered trying to help pick up some of the slack. After getting through UK Border Control, it took another 45 minutes before our bags arrived. Honestly. What a screw-up airport.",2.0
394,"Flew Heathrow to Auckland, via Zurich and Shanghai. Overall, Heathrow is great for its airside services and comparatively quick and friendly security process. Check in, however, is not so great. First, we were ushered towards the self service check in machines. We told the assistant that these generally hadn't worked on our long haul trips, but he insisted on trying. Sure enough, it didn't work, but the assistant said he'd try another couple of times as [the assistants] get into trouble with the airlines if passengers do not use the self service machines. It was only when the machine refused to work and we told him to give us our passports that he gave up and just walked away from us. We ended up at a desk. The lady we went to did not greet us kindly and frankly looked miserable. She told us our check in had been partially completed and had been done incorrectly. She said 'this is actually the business class desk, but I'll do it for you anyway.' (It's worth noting this was 6am, there were hardly any other other passengers around and no other desks open for our flight). When we mentioned our issues with the machines, she told us that's not her problem. She again said that the assistants at the self service check in machines are told by the airlines/airport to ensure people avoid the check in desks. She also told us that the machines are not set properly by the airlines to work on our kind of travel. Overall, not a positive start to a long trip.",4.0
395,"A long haul return trip which involved 3 international airports and 1 domestic, guess which one gets the thumbs down. For many years LHR has been a misery through which to travel. Trying to negotiate it is like rummaging in the Christmas sales and best avoided. T5, oh my word, what a mishmash. Arriving by bus from T2 on the ground floor, we had to make our way to the top floor. There is nothing warm about the décor with its display of the nuts and bolts that keep the building up. I recall the old Terminal 1 and this isn't much of an improvement. Upon arrival at the top of the escalator, a check on the flights board to determine where we should go for some assistance on our airline, then a look around at the myriad drop off points and signs which are strewn through the middle of the hall which completely obliterate the view of anything else which might be useful. That meant we dealt with a person who had a sign above her head which said ""Assistance"" when we would have been better and probably quicker at a more appropriate desk. We had been unable to check in online the night before at LAX for some unknown reason and she dealt with that part of the problem, but, could not resolve our major complaint and we had to go to desks at the far side of the hall which were fairly well obscured from view. At least the person there dealt relatively quickly and easily with our issue. This terminal and probably all of LHR needs a simplification of signage. Even fully awake, airports can be difficult to navigate, but, tired passengers don't appreciate being assailed with arrays of signage. The T5 BA Business Lounge (domestic) is shabby to say the least. The terminal itself didn't look as though there was much seating, although we were too busy trying to sort out problems to notice much, and Zone A looked very crowded. The worst thing about LHR is staff attitude. The first thing they need to realise is that airports are there for the travellers. Even when smiling at you, the attitude seems to go from condescending to surly to couldn't care less with few, but, very welcome, exceptions. Listening to what customers actually say would be helpful. Too big, too muddled, unwelcoming. Would prefer to avoid if at all possible.",4.0

On my last trip through the airport we had to get to T1 from T3. After taking a bus to T1 we proceeded to the gate as displayed. However, between looking at the screen and completing our long walk to the gate, we discovered it had been changed. This meant we had to run to the opposite end of the terminal. We were lucky that our next flight was delayed or we may have missed it. Furthermore, we were held up at security where the staff were slow and relaxed and seemed more interested in having a chat with us than getting us through as quick as possible.

My only gripe to be honest is that there is a hell of a trek to make before you reach the departure gates in the satellite. Fast track was fairly busy but the queues were not too long and we were airside within about ten minutes.

419,"Am a regular traveller via T5 to Edinburgh with BA. Had noticed in the past that when the lift arrives at departures, many (what appear to be business) travellers make a mad and crazy dash for security, mowing down anyone on the top concourse who might be in their way. But it was only this evening that I realised why. I found out that T5 runs a policy of barring you from boarding your flight if you are not through security within 35 mins of your flight departing. I was at security this evening 27 mins before my flight was due to leave and was barred from getting through. Only the seasoned traveller knows of this 35 mins rule - from experience, as BA doesn't tell you (I checked my pre-flight e-mail from BA and it definitely doesn't point this out). What happens then if you are not at security within this 35mins period? Well, you are directed straight to BA's massive sales desk, located between the two security entry (or better still 'non-entry') points. Yes, you have to book a new ticket and may have to wait days for the next available flight. Nice way of getting lots of money from you for nothing. My advice: Stay away from Terminal 5. Simple reason: it's the only airport terminal anywhere where BA controls security and therefore controls the amount of time that you are forced to spend in the shopping area beyond security (minimum time that you must spend in and around the shops is 35 minutes), a retail and catering offer which is, surprise-surprise, owned by BA.",1.0

It is about a 5 minute walk to UK Border Control, and the signs are easy to follow. The immigration line moved slowly on Friday afternoon, but the immigration officer was very courteous. Baggage claim and currency exchange were fast. It wasn't very obvious to me how to reach ground transportation (Hoppa Bus to Hotels), but one of the airport personnel was kind enough to guide me in the right direction. After taking the elevators to the shuttle area, I had to wait a long time for the bus to my particular hotel. On my way back, check-in and security were very smooth. I couldn't believe how quickly I was able to get through all the processes and reach the boarding area.

422,"Airport security rude, unfriendly, unhelpful. They seem to forget that passengers travelling through this airport are paying customers. You are treated like some sort of criminal for no reason.

I would hate to think about my relatives from America and Asia having to use this airport and the bad impression it gives of London and the UK. Also for long haul passengers like myself that also travel regularly this is a lot of money on an air ticket and would expect to be treated respectfully and kindly at the start of any holiday. On top of that the terminal is old and requires long walks to departure gates.

Plenty of choice for food because there were so many restaurants and shops.",8.0
424,"For an airport of this size and relevance Heathrow is rather underwhelming. The layout of separate terminals means that you should add a lot of extra time if you have a transfer at this airport. Connection to the city is good, but only if you have enough cash to pay for the expensive Heathrow Express. Otherwise you will be using the regular tube line where you will try to find a spot for you and your bags among commuters. The airport is well organized but there are often big queues especially at immigration so you should take that into consideration when making your plans. For the airport of this size food and shopping is very poor (except for T5 which gives a bit more options). Many of the chains have only one restaurant at one of the terminals so you might not find what you were hoping for on yours. There are no really good food options and when it comes to shopping there are only a few luxury stores plus a few stationery stores and that's it. Staff are mostly rude and tired, which is not surprising, but it is an annoyance. I think you should try one of the other airports in the city before Heathrow.",4.0

And like her, many other old people connecting from Europe or Asia. The new change effective October 14th, 2015 certainly did not make me a happy traveler with BA.

She said I am just doing my job but there are ways of doing the job politely and respectfully instead of rudely and vindictively. When she saw me looking at her badge, she immediately turned it around so I could not get her name. Politeness and common sense were completely absent. There was nothing unusual in our bags.

Realising that I was close to having a panic attack, I managed to make my way back to security, where I spent a most miserable hour crouched on a chair almost out of sight of the dreaded screens. Even there, the harsh lighting and black surfaces are incredibly unpleasant and stressful. I must have been visibly distressed, yet the dozens of staff completely ignored me. I had intended to buy several items at the airport, but was so disoriented by the lighting and the screens, I couldn't get any of the things I wanted. I have been through hundreds of airports, and T2 is by a very long way the most ghastly, inhuman, miserable, utterly inhospitable place I have ever had the misfortune to experience.

Arrival at Terminal 2 from Vienna - a very long taxi to the gate after touchdown. Another long, long cold walk to arrivals. The E-Passport gates in passport control kept crashing, there were lots of Border Agency staff just standing around barking at people - wouldn't they be better employed on a desk checking passports and clearing the queues?

They put me through a full body scanner and then went to pat me down. Twice I asked that this be done in sight of my belongings - I have had things lifted at other airports. Not only did the security guard refuse to move the pat down location 2-3 feet away so I could see my things, she patted down every inch of my body at least twice and used her wand multiple times. It was as if either she was ""teaching me a lesson"" for asking to be near my things, or she actually wanted my things to sit unattended long enough to be stolen.

All in all from landing to getting out of the terminal took 2 hours. Welcome to London. I then made a bus transfer to Stanstead. The central Bus Station which was never very great is being refurbished and passengers now have to queue in a temporary area outside T3. Place is a joke. As a Brit, it's frankly embarrassing.",2.0
441,"I have used Heathrow many times in recent years and although I still like T5, it seems to get busier and busier each time. I enjoy transferring from a domestic UK to an international flight there, no hassle at all. I like the opposite less. Having to go through a boarding pass check by the airline, then an immigration check by the UK Border authorities, then going through a boarding pass check by airport security even before joining the often slow line at security is extremely tedious, especially if you have arrived on a long flight. Security can sometimes be very rude too I have noticed. Recently I have had to transfer from a T5 domestic to a T3 international flight and in those cases you do have to pass through security again, even though you are only on an airport connecting bus. Getting to the security checkpoint in T3 requires a long walk up and down escalators and through deserted corridors which don't give a good impression. The gates are nicely refurbished, but the central waiting and shopping areas are busy and the low ceilings make them very dark. Hopefully if T1 reopens the pressure on space will be reduced. I would recommend Heathrow to some people and not to others, depending on the kind of connection they were making and their level of mobility.",6.0

443,Arrived at Heathrow Terminal 5 from Baku on the evening of 30th August to find the queue of people way past the immigration and down the walkway. After about fifteen minutes another flight arrived and they emerged from an escalator in the middle of the heaving mass to jump in front of most of us. There was one totally ineffective security  lady who just gave up trying to control the chaos. When we eventually arrived at the hall where the immigration officers were sitting we found four in place. There was about 20 electronic gates but none were switched on. Of course being British I had to use the UK/EU line which was about 50 times longer than the non-EU one. I would have cleared the line half an hour earlier if I had been a foreign national. I was pleased to see that the aircraft staff desk was manned with not one person arriving there after the first ten minutes. After about 45 mins of sitting watching the seething mass in the hall the officer manning the empty desk decided that it was all too much and left. The terminal or rather arrival gate we came into at T5 was not finished but of course T1 - the Baku flight original terminal had been closed. Prematurely it seems. Frankly Heathrow or at least T5 is a shambles and the owners and UK Government should be ashamed.,1.0

Waited over an hour for baggage while they kept announcing changes of belt. There are quite obviously failures in management since the whole concept of customer service is absent. Terminal 3 has seating for 5 passengers at each baggage belt (when a plane drops off 300 passengers the maths just doesn't work). The luggage trolley rack is located at the opposite end from where arrivals enter the baggage hall; a smidgen of common sense here would avoid passengers flying off in all directions, bumping into each as the get a trolley and then come back to baggage carousel to pick up delayed luggage (if they are the lucky ones).

I arrived at LHR on an overnight British Airways flight from San Francisco, and thought it would be straightforward to manage passport control in time for my connecting flight, which was scheduled to depart 2 hours later out of the same terminal (Terminal 5). Several factors conspired to make me almost miss my connecting flight: 1) Terrible signage, which led to my standing in the wrong passport control line for over 40 minutes, only to be told (upon reaching the passport control agent) that I was in the wrong line and needed to go to the ""Flight Connections"" line. 2) The control agents in the second line were very efficient, and kindly gave me a fluorescent orange ""Fast Track"" note to expedite my transit, but this may have done more harm than good, since the ""Fast Track"" security line into which I was routed was a Kafkaesque experience. All passengers were required to pass through security (again), which involved removing all gels/liquids/pastes/etc. from carry-on luggage, transferring them into a small plastic bag, removing laptops etc., and standing in a incredibly slow line to go through a metal detector. Passengers were not asked to remove their shoes, but every single passenger I saw go through the metal detector triggered the alarm, which required a) removal of said shoes to be X-rayed and b) a thorough and very slow pat-down by one of two agents (one for men, one for women), which slowed the line to a crawl. I watched over 30 minutes elapse while standing in this line (again, this was the ""Fast-Track"" line), and then my bag was flagged for random screening, requiring an additional 10+ minutes while another security agent swiped my various bags and tested them by gas chromatography. By the time I got through this process, my flight was about to close, and I had to run at full tilt to the gate, roughly a kilometer from the security checkpoint. The terminal seemed to have some nice shops, restaurants, and other amenities, but I was unable to appreciate them while running at top speed from the security line to my gate.",1.0

We had to do it twice both on our way to India and returning to the States. In both instances understaffed check points and truly bazaar search habits lead to extended delays. Our return trip we went through security checks in Mumbai, Delhi, Paris with no concerns or questions. We never left any airport - yet at Heathrow it took over 1 hour as the chap checked every small bottle, my wife's jewelry and other non-liquid items. No amount of complaining to a ""supervisor"" was effective as he said, there were new procedures for the UK.

I also hate the fact that they do not post boarding gates until close to boarding time, meaning that you constantly have to check the monitors.

462,"Arrived on BA from Dubai at Terminal 5 at around 6 am, along with a bunch of long-haul 747/777/A380 arrivals from all over the world. There were bottlenecks on the walk from the gate down to the shuttle trains which take people from the remote satellite terminals to the 'main' part of T5 which houses passport control/baggage reclaim as well as check-in/security on departure. Had to wait around 20 minutes to get on a train, because in many cases the shuttles would arrive from the previous stop (the C gates) already full. Was a bit stressful. At passport control, it was a 30-minute wait for non-EU nationals, expected as this was the morning rush. Immigration officer was courteous and polite (am a frequent visitor to the UK, so minimal questions asked). She endorsed (i.e. stamped) the wrong visa, and when I pointed out her error, she rectified her mistake with minimal fuss. Bags didn't take much time. Very convenient vending machines if you need to pick up a SIM card in the baggage claim hall-if not, there are several shops in the arrivals area selling UK SIM cards, plus WHSmith and a few other outlets. Signage to Heathrow Express clear, and in 20 minutes was in central London. Departure: Arrived on the HEX, and wanted to do VAT refund, but the office was on the other side of the terminal, and quite busy at that, so I ended up ditching-they should have a VAT refund office on either end of the large T5 check-in area. My flight left at 1pm, and there were quite a number of flights leaving, a mixture of European and intercontinental flights. Used self-service kiosks to print BPs, then waited for a good 30 minutes in the bag drop queue. Would be much more efficient to have a proper self check-in service, where passengers can print and stick their bag tags themselves. Although the queue to get into security was short, getting in line to go through the scanner, then waiting again for the bags to come out through the machine all ended up taking a good 15 minutes. By then, only had 70 minutes or so until departure. Bearing in mind that my flight left from Gate B35, which required another ride on the shuttle, only had 20-25 minutes to grab a bit and run. Despite arriving 3 hours in advance, with the all the walking and waiting, felt like I was cutting it close. Overall a mixed bag. I highly recommend anyone planning on doing a VAT refund to get there a good 4 hours before their flight (and of course, you need to be prepared to show them your purchases, so unless it's in your carry-on, you need to do this before checking in your bags).",7.0

Our flight arrives late to Heathrow though, and then the real fun begins. After a thorough security check by British officials in Edinburgh, we are subject to that all over again after an excruciatingly long bus ride between idiotically poorly connected terminals (arrival at T5 and departure for LAX at T3). Both times we're ""randomly picked"" for a 2nd level security check. So OK, through all that and then we need to re-check in again for the AA flight to LAX (after printing boarding passes online with all docs verified). Why? Then we are so lucky to actually learn of the departure gate a full 5 minutes before all the other clueless passengers who are anxiously watching the monitors. This is one of the silliest parts of the operation: holding the gate secret until 20 minutes before boarding. Anyway, rush to the very far away gate, and then into a new secure area- yes another check of passport and boarding pass that gains us access to the usual ugly 'stall' with no services and no bathrooms. There more poor people (thankfully not us) being checked by yet more random searching.

Distances are long however, and both my recent flights arrived at either a remote stand or the satellite terminal. The policy of announcing the departure gate only an hour beforehand is annoying, especially if the departure is from the B or C gates, which take a while to get to.",8.0
467,"I completely agree with reviews submitted by Alan Gerbhart and Michelle Strauss. It took me 70 minutes from arrival to clearing security into Terminal 5A on 21st July despite having ""fast-track"". At immigration there was a problem scanning a baby's eyes but instead of taking the issue aside the immigration people (5) dealt with the issue at the desk holding every other customer back - there was no other desk in use at this point as every immigration officer decided they would also assist with the baby - ridiculous, and no apology obviously. At security the queues were surprisingly short (see immigration issue) but they still insisted on swabbing bags and items unnecessarily, even lifting chocolates out of my daughters bag and re-scanning them - why? We also had a duty free bottle of perfume, sealed in the bag with the receipt but again they insisted on opening it and testing it - is there no-one with any common sense employed? And of course no sign of supervision or management anywhere. I compare you to many other international hubs I travel through and without doubt immigration and security here are the worst for organisation, worst for customer service and worst for passenger management I have ever had the displeasure to come across.",1.0
468,"Terminal 2 - This Terminal appears to have been deliberately designed to make things as difficult as possible for passengers to negotiate. If you are not young and fit I would suggest you avoid it. I have some mobility issues and I found this Terminal difficult in the extreme. Plenty of room in Car Park then lifts take you to area out in front of Terminal Building. When you enter you are met by automatic check-in machines with desks behind but no staff to help you find out what you need to do. I decided to avoid the machines and eventually find the EVA Air Business Class check-in desk. Staff here were excellent. I make my way to Security. Despite being very quiet, passengers are still made to snake through the movable barriers forcing them to walk about 20 times further than necessary. Fairly quick getting through the checks and then passports. Now the problems really begin. The signs inside the Terminal building are unclear and totally inadequate. I eventually work out I now need to go down a level. The lifts throughout the terminal are generally tucked away, difficult to find, and at least half appear to be marked 'Staff Only'. At the next level I again can't find any clear signs to show how to get to the Business Lounge, which I was told was near the gate. The design of this level is awful. There are no clear, easy routes to get across. Passengers are forced to walk much further than necessary. It appears to be in order to make them go as close to as many shops as possible. I eventually find the exit I need in the far corner. I now have to go down yet another level. I am now faced with a lifeless corridor. It is a very, very long walk from here to the gates and the Lounge. There are some moving walkways. By the time I get close to the gates I am in pain. I now discover I have to go back up a level to get to the Lounge. Unbelievable! I then have to go back down and walk a little further to get to the gate when it's time to board. Boarding was shambolic. No information given. One mad scrum and slow moving queues. Arriving back in the Terminal was no better. On leaving the plane I have to immediately use a small, slow lift to go up a level. There is then quite a walk. I then have to find a lift to go up another level. The lifts are an even further walk, with confusing signs and most of the lifts marked 'Staff Only' or 'Buggies Only'. The sign in the lift says I need Level 3 for Arrivals but there are only buttons for 0 and 2! There is then a very, very, very long walk and the need to use yet another lift. I eventually get to Passport Control. I have a Priority Lane pass but there are very few staff in it so there is quite a wait. Through Customs then outside to find the way to taxis. I find I have to walk to the other end of the concourse and go down a level in the lift. I then have another quite long walk to the taxi queue. There are plenty of taxis for the number of people waiting but only one member of Airport staff doing the taxi bookings. A long wait. I have travelled a great deal over many years and Heathrow T2 is, without doubt, the worst one I have gone through in terms of access, passenger convenience and ease of use. I find it staggering that it has been expensively re-designed very recently and this us the result. I shall be doing all I can to avoid using it",3.0

Wheelchair users - don't let them take your wheelchair away until you get to the plane. We did and my wife was taken by LHR wheelchair to a holding area where she was put on a seat and the wheelchair taken away - and left there for over an hour. She was then taken by buggy to a lift and had to ""walk"" to the departure gate where she was transferred to transport to the plane. On our return to LHR we held onto the wheelchair which was brought to the plane but it took over 45 minutes to arrange transport to the baggage reclaim.",1.0

Queuing time to get to the belt was only 7 mins. The whole process needs review - rejecting bags randomly and then swabbing them 20 times while mountains of luggage build up on the belts and people are in a frenzy to catch their flights.  Don't use the excuse ""but we are just keeping you safe Sir"" - other airports keep us equally safe in a much more pleasant and stress free fashion. I don't think its a staff issue, and maybe their sullenness is simply a defence against the barrage of abuse they suffer for being at the front end of stupid processes.",1.0

We only had an hour layover coming back to the USA. Security is very slow at this airport. We would not have made our connecting flight if I had not asked one of the security personnel to help us get through so as not to miss the flight. He was nice and helped us get through the line.

We were told that somebody would be with us in 5 minutes. Half an hour later, and despite a further 3/4 presses on the bell, still nothing. Eventually, as time was passing by quickly, and we needed to catch the flight, I slowly hobbled to the desk where this lack of service was 'co-ordinated'. The only explanation given by the sole person at the desk for this lack of service was that neither he, nor the woman pushing the wheelchair, knew where the various numbered locations were around the airport! Eventually I was taken in a chair, to the relevant Gate for the flight, but had to painfully and slowly walk the remaining distance to board the aircraft. Although allowed to set off before other passengers, in order that I could get to the seat before fellow passengers, this wasn’t possible, as I was soon overtaken by others on the way. Arrival back at Terminal 5 wasn't much better, again with some delay, finally being 'dumped' at baggage reclaim, although we had none to collect, and that was it! From there to the area where the taxi could pick us up, was a further long walk.",3.0

If they were ever polite I would think there was something wrong. I found the process of going through check in and security very faceless and impersonal, then when I got through the to the airside part of the terminal I found terminal two very cramped, the food available very lacking and overpriced, in fact the meal deal in WH Smiths was the best choice. Overall my thoughts of Heathrow is that they want my money but forget what the passenger actually wants or how we wish to be treated.",1.0

476,"We were First Class passengers flying through LHR on our way to Athens from IAD. I have transited or arrived in LHR more times than I can count, always on British Airways. This was the worst experience ever. My traveling companion had forgotten to remove two small liquid containers from his luggage to be scanned separately in a plastic bag. Although we were in the FastTrack line, we were shunted off to a secondary screening line where the hand baggage of individual passengers who did not somehow pass the screening were sent. The gentleman at the head of the line said he had been there for over an hour and had already missed his flight. There were a number of other people in line. The secondary screeners were rude and unprofessional, and the process was vastly over-complicated. Security is a necessity, but efficiency is also important. It appeared that each individual compartment in any hand luggage that had some sort of violation had to be swabbed, and the swabs read. There was a single person doing this, and the line kept getting longer and longer. A supervisor came over several times but left after a few minutes, doing nothing to remedy the hold-ups. We finally were cleared after almost 90 minutes in this line. The offending liquids could have been removed, put into a separate tray, and the offending liquids and bags could have been resent through the screening machines. This process is often used in other airports when there is a problem with hand baggage. This was the worst and most unprofessional screening I have ever seen.",1.0

(2) Security can be very time-consuming, especially and oddly on weekend mornings. Allow plenty of time. (3) While the UK is (still) in the EU, it is not a Schengen country.

486,I have to say the new T2 is a missed opportunity. Whilst the new terminal is obviously a generational step forward on the old many of the practical aspects of the design are deficient. The lifts and escalators up from the rail station to departures go through a huge covered outdoor void a strange choice in a city where the average temp is low. This looks even more of a deficiency when you enter the departures section inside and see it is cramped. People tripping over each other to deposit bags too few check-in kiosks etc.. Why did they scrimp on the area of the departures hall interior when they had literally acres of adjacent space under cover outside. Equally baffling was despite building this huge outdoor covered void the car and bus drop off areas are uncovered requiring passengers to still walk out in the rain. Again a strange choice for a wet city like London. All in all for a brand new terminal I would give it's design a pass mark at best.,5.0
487,Arrived in T5 on 28th May 20.00hrs as is always the case BA flight from Brussels was delayed. However was amazed astonished disgusted with the lack of organisation in the immigration processing hall some staff were arguing aggressively with passengers who understandably were showing their frustration with the situation. It took a minimum of 45 minutes to process through immigration no explanation or apology no advance warning even on the flight. I will try to avoid Heathrow in future in the same way I try to avoid British Airways.,
488,Transited through Terminal 5 on the 18th May 2015 travelling from Dublin to Tokyo. Landed at Heathrow late morning. Passport control at flight connections was a chaotic mess between staff and passengers nobody seemed to know what was going on. Huge queue and badly organised. Finally got through. Found a lot of the terminal was under renovation. All the shops were luxury shops too expensive for most people and the restaurants were the same. And the terminal was very overcrowded. Then when I went to get my flight directions were poor realised very late that my gate was on lower level. Other passengers were also late finding the gate. Then had to take bus a ridiculously long way to the plane. It took forever. So flight was late departing which meant being stuck in a long queue to take off. I have always found Heathrow a good airport for transfers. This was my first time at Terminal 5 though and it was a disaster. Will avoid Terminal 5 from now on.,3.0
489,My first use of the new Terminal 2. On departure the check-in area is large and spacious like the old T1 its on a level up from roadside so you approach via an elevated road. Once through security (no problems there with the staff) there are enough seats for everyone. My main gripe is the place lacks that certain atmosphere the old T2 had. It all seemed a bit too new and sterile. Walking under the aircraft parking area to get to the departure gate was a little annoying but moving walkways help. On return the corridor from the gate to the security/passport area is so narrow its a joke. That said everything is on one level and walking distances are short. Spoilt by the queue at the e-passport booths but made up somewhat by fast baggage delivery and a short walk to get outside for the buses to the car parks. Shame then you have to go down a level to get to them. Guess T2 is like so many new terminals; functional but lacks individuality and character.,6.0
490,We recently arrived into T5 from Boston. We were embarrassed by our own country. It was understaffed and poorly laid out and we barely made our connection. Security took an age to get through - and why do you need to go through X-ray etc again when you have just landed? The train transfers were packed so very few people could board and the electronic passport controls seemed to malfunction more often than they worked. It was a complete fiasco.,
491,T3 arrival only. Plane arrived early but delay due to airbridge issues meant late getting off. Gate was a long way from immigration. On the walk there I was passed by many fast walkers and even people running. When I arrived there I could see why long lines for the automatic passport gates only 3 later 4 UK/EU passport desks open and 1 or maybe 2 other passports open. Only advantage to the long wait for passport control was the bag was on the belt when I got there I was lucky as it was stopped and it looked like they were having issues restarting it. After customs I went to look for the shuttle bus to my hotel only to find the bus stops arrows pointed in 3 different directions depending on stand number but I spotted an information stand near one of the signs so went to ask where I found 2 members of staff chatting. After a while standing there I interrupted them with an 'excuse me' and my answer was a thumb in the general direction of one of the arrows without them breaking their conversation. I know the immigration issues are not totally under BAA's control but it does let down the whole airport.,5.0
492,Hong Kong to London Heathrow T3. May 22nd 2015 6.40am arrival. 1 hour + wait for baggage. Terrible service - the whole process of landing at Heathrow (any terminal) is slow. Take a leaf out of Hong Kong's book and see how efficient they are. No excuses please improve for everyone's good judgement when they arrive into the UK.,
493,Terminal 4. When will Heathrow become international? The complete attitude from customs in astonishing. I had to wait 15 min until customs could be bothered to check my bag only for them to tell me it was because I had left my iPad in my bag. Every other airport tells you to leave it in your bag? No signage to suggest otherwise just the attitude. To claim the VAT back leads you to unpack all items or again facing the attitude of customs who tell you to produce all items to be claimed. Will avoid at all costd in the future!,
494,Arrived T5 Satellite B Sunday May 17 at 6.15 am - a busy time of day. Got from plane door to meeting my ride in less than 15 minutes. Granted no bags but did have E-Gate malfunction and had to go to the desk. Never achieved that kind of speed at the other airports everyone raves about in this forum.,10.0
495,The Airport is clean. But the food outlets in Terminal 4 seems to offer few vegetarian options. That should be taken care of. Secondly wifi is free for 8 hours. I know no one will stay at an airport for 8 hours unless necessary. Wifi should be free all the time.,7.0
496,Terminal 5 security appears short staffed and the supervisor at A gates on the 11th May appears to relish upping the chance of people missing connecting flights. I travelled on a BA flight from JFK arriving into Heathrow at 06.35 with a connecting BA flight to Leeds Bradford due to fly at 08.55. We followed instructions for the transit and passed quickly through passport control. When we arrived at security it was very crowded as I realise many flights arrive in early morning. Nevertheless the queue moved and finally it was my turn. Having gone through security at JFK I hadn't thought there would be a problem but stupidly I forgot that I had a small bottle of wine from the overnight flight in my handbag. Quite rightly this was picked up and my tray set aside and joined the queue of another 8 trays of hand luggage that had to be checked. Time was suddenly against me. I realised what the problem was and asked if the bottle could be removed and rechecked to expedite myself getting to the gate. This is not possible. I was told to ask the supervisor. The rude indifference of this man was so frustrating. In the end the lady checking the bags said if the others awaiting their bags to be checked were OK to let mine go in front of theirs then she would check it. The offending bottle of wine was removed and the bag rechecked and I ran as fast any 63 year old woman can run to Gate A2 where my friend had gone to inform the staff at the gate what was happening. We got on the flight the door was closed and we pushed back. I know it was my fault but the rude indifference and almost relish of how this was handled was appalling. Next time I will go via Amsterdam. Fast track their means is more about your connecting flight time rather than your Club status and in transit security staff do not seem so poorly manned.,4.0
497,"T5. Appalling security. Approximately 70% of screened bags referred for manual checks with only one person doing checks - whilst many passengers overseas did not comply with regulations on fluids this seemed to be the most common issue and therefore area is inadequately staffed. There was no information for overseas passengers prior to screening about the rules. Had to wait 40 minutes for my bag to be checked - manually to find out that there was no problem nor could the explain need for the additional check. My wife had the same issue on adjacent scanner to be told that bag laptop and fluids not ""laid out far enough apart"" in the tray and her wait was 50 minutes. This is my first Heathrow transit in approximately 10 years as I usually can use Manchester for all of my long haul travel needs. I will avoid Heathrow in the future.",
498,I travel regularly for work and have used Heathrow Terminal 5 6 times already this year and each time it has been a total shambles. Anyone transferring to a connecting flight here has to face the very real possibility of missing their flight and dealing with some of the most aggressive and rude security staff in the world. The connection system does not work and I'm embarrassed that this is the major hub of UK. I would strongly advise all passengers to use and of the other major European hubs when transferring as Heathrow in my honest opinion is worse the worst in the continent. I assume that the ineffective system is due to too much space been given to retail the intelligence investment in resources or bad facilities planning. On my most recent trip there were twice as many people giving out free maps of London as there were working on security. Hopefully I will not be back here for sometime.,
499,Connected to LHR on my trip from BRU to LAX and return from SFO to BRU inbound and outbound flights were both times with BA thus connecting in from and to T5. I was really worried after all the bad reviews but had a really nice experience. I travelled economy so no fast track or lounge for me so had the basic encounter with the airport and have no complaints whatsoever. On the first leg (on a Tuesday morning around 7.30) I timed myself from the moment I stepped off the plane until I cleared security to less than 20 minutes! Lots of signs pretty clear instructions no problem. I had to take the train to T5C again nothing to worry about. On the way back coming from SFO and connecting to BRU early afternoon of another Tuesday I deplaned the A380 and timed myself again from getting off the plane (T5C) to clearing security: about 40 minutes although security was a little bit more crowded and my bag was put on the side and double checked. Overall I had a quite good experience but I can easily understand that it can quickly become a bad one when there are lots of people or when having tight and stressful connection. I found T5A to be a little bit overcrowded but you can still manage to find a place to sit. LHR is a great place for plane spotting!,8.0

501,I am a frequent traveller and have little choice but to use Heathrow as my hub for certain flights this means transferring from T2 to T5. The transfer itself is not a problem but the security process is. I flew out to Athens and had to wait 40 minutes at security to have my toiletries checked only to be told that after the initial alarm they were safe and did not pose a 'security threat' after all. On my return went through security at flight connections carrying four tins of honey bought in Duty Free at Athens sealed in a transparent bag etc as per EU regulations. But at Heathrow one of these tins according to the machinery in use appeared to pose a 'threat to security' and I was told (politely) I could not carry the honey in my hand luggage but would have to check it in this meant leaving flight connections via the utterly chaotic passport control where the staff appear to be trained only to shout at travellers I checked my luggage with my airline and re-entered the main security area. The staff were rude and insolent. This experience is not the first I have made if I could I would find an alternative hub for my onward journeys from Ireland. And it is not just Heathrow I have experienced similar at both Stansted and Gatwick. UK airports are now to be avoided at all costs. Rudeness is the norm and a complete lack of common sense.,
502,Flew From T2 to Toronto. Nice airy spacious terminal. It is all self service now meaning you even have to print your own labels. A female member of staff spoke to us very rudely when we asked for help with the labels. Instead of patronising people with your superior smugness you might want to hop to a counter and serve people in the old fashioned way you used to. Very disappointing. Otherwise fine but the usual range of high end and rip off shops airside.,4.0
503,Athens - London - Philadelphia dep on 18/3 return 19/4 via BA terminal 5. An absolute disappointment in this confusing and complicated terminal packed like sardines in that train though a world traveler lost in that confusing terminal and my polite request to an airport employee for directions received an angry and impolite reply. On my return I had to rush to catch my onward flight to Athens I pushed my way in that train like a sardine and took an oath to avoid this terminal in the future. I must compliment a BA employee who was extremely willing and helpful at gate 14 - if I remember well.,5.0

505,"Terminal 2 is now akin to a ""lost cost airline"" terminal - meaning DIY. When you check in for your flight you have no choice you have to scan your passport and then print your own boarding card and your luggage tag and apply the luggage tag yourself to your bags before you are permitted to join the queue to fully check in and talk to someone which then takes the same time as a normal check in at any other airport. Many staff standing around (and few very helpful and most frankly rather condescending towards customers who just do not get the concept) that actually could be put to better use by getting behind the desks and checking you into your flight and conducting the full procedure like any other airport. Security very disorganized and not efficient at all and WiFi in the terminal is hopeless as keeps cutting out. Many staff including gate staff and G4 Security staff borderline rude towards customers in the way they talk and look at people and just too many all standing around and talking to each other. Other facilities within the terminal are satisfactory including the restaurants and duty free.",2.0
506,An international traveller does not have too much expectation on any airport but so far Heathrow is still considered to be a very busy international airport. Nothing to do with the facilities but the security staff. 10 out of 10 that I read them are rude and impatient. I witnessed one of the security officers shouting at a passenger I heard the lady only asking about the security procedures. She said nothing wrong. If staff cannot deal with their daily workloads then the job is unsuitable for them.,
507,Arrived at the new T2 and it looked very well laid out and exited quickly. The problem is the congestion of planes not the terminal. Having landed it is really unacceptable to be left on a taxiway for 15 minutes because a gate was not available. LHR want another runway but they cannot even handle the flights they already have. A shame because the new T2 looked really nice but it just takes too long for planes to park getting to car rental etc.,5.0
508,What a shame that T2 doesn't have the passenger in mind what an opportunity missed and what was the thinking behind the design? Indeed design a fab new building but not for the purpose of architectural vanity. You forgot the passenger experience here. I have travelled widely internationally but the distance travelled from check in to my outgoing SQ flight and baggage reclaim from my incoming SQ flight takes some beating quite bonkers. What should be a relatively smooth and stress free transition to and from flights has become a heck of a long walk but at least it got my leg muscles working after a 13 hr flight! As for arriving by the Heathrow Express or Tube - add another 30 mins after you have your bags once you have negotiated the barriers and stranded trolleys. Why are we unable to access these services from within the building rather than having to exit and then descend via slow elevators or escalators? Give me T4 any day. So the important point here is make sure you give yourself plenty of time to get to the departure gate indeed the 2-3 hr check-in timeline from ticketing to the gate has never been more relevant with the new T2.,3.0
509,Without doubt the worst airport in the world including Lagos. Had the misfortune to arrive after departing from Dubai int. airport. What a culture shock! From happy smiling faces to misery. Miserable faces terrible customer service and downright rudeness. Travelled with Virgin which was wonderful. Required assistance for walking difficulties. Wonderful help until Terminal 3. Arguments about who would pick me up someone took me from plane to halfway to first ramp. Waited ages for electric truck got another 50 yards then told could go no further. Managed to walk the rest of way to baggage reclaim. Spoke to lady there about assistance that had been booked. Told me to sit and wait but no seats! After waiting 20 mins my wife and I struggled to car park. What a shambles.,
510,T5 arrived in the early morning rush. Was through all controls and back in lounge in 30 minutes which has been a fairly typical experience. I think may critics have unreal expectations of a very large airport. I have travelled extensively and Heathrow compares well with most others. All airports require security when connecting and many now have trains/escalators to connect between terminals - why do people complain when asked to do the same here ? I am in my 60's and have no trouble managing to get from A to B and I find that signage is perfectly adequate if you bother to look at it. Staff may be less than friendly but that has been my experience in most of the airports around the world.,8.0
511,My first time through T2. Who designed this passenger nightmare! OK so check-in and getting through passport check and security was OK (Heathrow is an airport that has invested in decent security arrangements). But then to the gate - nightmare! Long walks inadequate moving walkways - where's the train or people mover?,3.0
512,Transferred from an international flight in T2 to a domestic one. My incoming flight was a little late admittedly but the extremely long queue for EU immigration was being handled by one person. No-one in authority to organise the priority of any passengers. The people in front of me had a 4 hour period - I had half an hour. The queue for international immigration was almost non-existent but the haughty woman said she was unable to assist. A staff member with a walkie talkie appeared and then proceeded to tell us he had no responsibility for this area. Here's a suggestion - use your initiative and find someone who is. Eventually two people came along and proceeded to prioritise flights which were later than ones almost ready to depart the story goes on and on but the woman then proceeded to yell at me that I had 2 minutes or I would miss my flight. Have travelled extensively around the world and I have never seen such a mismanaged situation. I was embarrassed to be British!,
513,"This has got to be the world's worst airport. Been here numerous times and not impressed. Sure it has its fancy expensive shops to make revenue but what about the people who want to sit down? Here's why I gave Heathrow 0/10. 1. Not enough seating areas - simply unacceptable. 2. Uncomfortable chairs - when the airport gives its passengers delays after delays at least provide comfortable chairs. Ever seen reclining chairs or free massage chairs in Singapore? 3. No trolleys - this one just blew me away. What if there are some pregnant/elderly or even just want some weight off your shoulders after a 13hr flight (like me 4 days ago)? Sorry not at Heathrow. First airport that I've seen that doesn't have trolleys. 4. Delays - this is bound to happen and I understand that. But if I can predict that I will have a delay that's sad. How did I predict? Well on a perfectly fine day without snow fog heavy rain wind etc. On the departure gate screen there were about 75% flights that were delayed. It seemed that the longer haul were taking off without delay but within Europe everyone was getting delayed. Then to make matters worse they decided to tell the passengers that the plane have ""not arrived yet"" when it was standing outside the window the whole time. 3hr delay with the plane there all along. Why? To fit 3 different flights in to 1. Again I understand that sometimes they have to do what the have to do but what I don't understand is why were 75% of all flights at Heathrow delayed? Why did everything have to be so disorganized? I felt extremely disappointed and its a shame that in my future travels I will try to avoid this airport at all costs even if that means paying for a more expensive ticket.",
514,After reading the scary reviews of LHR T5 I was rather apprehensive about my experience when I flew into London on British Airways from Delhi last year. Let me make this clear I had a perfectly good experience both ways. Arrival was a breeze. So was the return journey.,10.0
515,Absolutely appalling return to the UK after visiting relatives in USA for bereavement. Treated like cattle airport staff could not communicate in clear English we were polite they were insulting. Long walks for elderly dad.,
516,My wife and I returned through Terminal 4 from Manila on 19th Feb and were really appalled at the manner of the Immigration Officers on duty. They have no manners are not polite - no please or thank you. We have travelled through many countries and have always been treated with respect and politeness - what a shame that our own Country is let down so badly by it's frontline staff.,7.0
517,I don't understand why after billions of investment in T5 BA are still using buses for some flights to and from the plane. It really spoils the experience as well as taking much longer when time is critical. the bus driver on the return wasn't smooth. It's bad enough for able bodied people. Is BA doing this to save money? If so shame on them. I thought of seen the last of this outdated service in the UK which treats passengers like cattle.,4.0
518,Travelled through T5 on my way to Manchester. Only issues where minor delays caused by a plane blocking our gate on arrival which was cleared quickly and a minor moment of confusion over which passport line to go through. Luckily plenty of people in purple jackets to ask! Plenty of facilities for passengers if you want something to eat or drink. Terminal is relatively easy to navigate. Does it set my world on fire? No. Its an airport. But as airports go there are many many others which are far far worse. And very very few which are better.,10.0
519,Flew Heathrow to Frankfurt to connect to Sao Paulo flight. Flew from new Queens Terminal and loved it. Obviously the investment is paying off. Light airy and no queues to speak of. Well done Heathrow.,10.0
520,Terminal 2: Connecting from an Aer Lingus flight to an Air Canada flight (no terminal change) just before Christmas and missed the Air Canada flight due to incompetent security staff. Waited 45 mins at security (there were no queues!) to get my bag dropped on the floor and then pawed through by a rude operator while the manager refused to apologise for the slow service. After managing to make it through passport control I then faced a long walk/run to the B-wing gates where I discovered I had just missed the flight. To be fair the Air Canada staff at the gate were incredibly helpful and booked me onto the next available flight immediately.,1.0
521,I have now used terminal 2 several times now and each time I return dreading the experience. Queues everywhere at check-in empty counters the usual bling shops and too few eating and seating places. Designed by committee and approved by the usual BAA overpaid elite who care not a jot about their travellers only revenue. Then on your return - the long walk to freedom! Endless corridors which tax the fittest and god help anyone suffering with leg problems. It is ludicrous to expect people to endure this with no seats anywhere and few toilets. Have these people not listened to anyone? Yes I know they be ordered ahead but should they not be there already? At least a wheelchair!,3.0
522,Terminal 5 is a nightmare for intercontinental transit passenger. I have passed through many other airport but this is the worst designed airport terminal. My first flight got delayed by 3 hours and my 4 hour transit become 1 hour. I could not connect from gate C to gate A within the terminal. Reasons were: 1) Stupid design of gates A B C and security check between them takes hours. 2) Before entering gates A for transit BA checks the boarding pass and passport. Why do you need to check as the in-transit passengers just tell them the gate and passengers will manage. 3) Number of escalators up and down: I have to take 8 escalators to move from one gates to others. Who designed this.,1.0
523,As one of the busiest airports you would think customs could do a better job getting people through. There is always a slow moving line with never enough agents. In the future I will do my best to avoid Heathrow.,
524,Flew Heathrow to Frankfurt to connect to Sao Paulo flight. Flew from new Queens Terminal and loved it. Obviously the investment is paying off. Light airy and no queues to speak of. Well done Heathrow.,10.0
525,T2 - Shopping ridiculously high end - if you want cheap and cheerful food - forget it. EAT is the cheapest thing there (which says it all). Most restaurants have a name attached meaning its like you're fine dining and overly expensive. The shops are mostly high end designers. Barely anything to do. All in all really unnecessary and poorly thought out. Queue for the ticketing/check-in was a joke. Machine didn't work for us meaning we had to use the desk. We were 3rd in line straight away as there wasn't a big queue (doesn't sound too bad) however we were 3rd in line for about half an hour! So slow not very friendly or helpful.,3.0
526,Terminal 5 - traveling via London with a layover of hours in both directions. December 19th - January 4th. The passport check and security check are disorganized confusing and a pure nightmare. The wait and standstill was unbearable. Passengers were missing connecting flights stress tears and arguing. The lack of WiFi connection in this area was ridiculous. Hundreds of people just stood in lines moving one step forward every 10-15 minutes. This has been the worst experience that I've had in years.,
527,Arrived into Terminal 5 from Houston and was transferring to Dublin in same Terminal. The flight connection signs do not refer to transfers to UK and Ireland. We were told by ground staff to join the main transfer line on two occasions! These instructions were totally incorrect ! We eventually were told to join a different line. A waste of about 20 mins and we would have been about another 30 mins if we did not keep asking the ground staff. Flight to Dublin was delayed 1 hour but did not show on the information screen until original scheduled time had elapsed.,1.0
528,"Terminal 2 - 2 consecutive Thursday evening flights in from Munich there were delays of over one hour and over 90 minutes respectively whilst waiting on baggage. Reasons such as ""2 planes came in at once"" don't cut it. It's one of the busiest airports in the world why should planes landing at the same time be a problem or a surprise? Having to wait for plane doors to be opened (staff went to wrong end of terminal) and delays because all the biometric passport gates were closed are not good enough. No-one is ever there to take responsibility.",
529,Terminal 2 at LHR - flying business class on 1 Jan and couldn't check in at the business class desk because they were too busy. I was directed to self check in and set about printing my own luggage labels and boarding passes - I needed x2 but only got one and then had to wait 20 minutes for the other one. Having got rid of my luggage I then went to vat refund desk - queue a mile long. I abandoned the VAT refund experience and then went through security - all ok but then - no mini trolleys for hand luggage. I was forced to carry x2 7 kg hand luggage bags. Suffice to say I couldn't be bothered with any shopping. I then had the bright idea of going to a business class lounge before proceeding to my gate - another bad idea. I took a very long escalator followed by 3 travelators then another 2 escalators then a lift to the Air Canada lounge. I arrived sweating with an aching shoulder. Avoid terminal 2.,3.0
530,I have now used the new Terminal 2 on two occasions October and December 2014 and have been disappointed as I find there are not sufficient cafes (EAT had long queues) and I have struggled to find anything vegetarian in the restaurants. Even the vegetarian sandwiches were sold out. All in all lots of bling but that's it.,1.0
531,At Heathrow Terminal 5 waiting for bag drop. Absolutely unbelievable! Massive queues! Waited over 45minutes for bag drop! What's the point of having so many check-in counters but only a quarter of them is staffed! Hoping to become a world class airport? However there's not many choices when flying out or into London. Other 'London' airports are so far out of London and they are even worse then Heathrow!,
532,Terminal 5. We arrived on an early morning flight from Cape Town and took more than an hour to get through transfer. Totally under provisioned for volume of traffic. This was not the first such experience but it was the worst to date. How can most other major airports manage to do the necessary in reasonable time?,2.0
533,Terminal 2 a nightmare. Uncomfortable to use departures on level 5 accessible only by lifts if you have baggage. Then a walk in icy blast across an exposed area open to the elements. Self check-in a shambles. Walked forever to get to gate. I will fly from a regional airport next time and transit somewhere comfortable like Schipol or Zurich or Dubai.,
534,"Terminal 5. We arrived from South Africa to transfer to Edinburgh on Saturday 13th Dec and the late arriving A380 eventually parked at the far satellite - we then had to queue to board the very full transit train with everyone carrying luggage join the queue to follow ""Flight Connections"" queue to pass through passport control more escalators and walking brought us to yet another queue for security and on to the gate to queue yet again on those yellow footprints. Time to travel a few hundred yards = 70 minutes - and we caught our connection but our luggage did not. Terminal 5 seems to have been designed by the junior staff - it is not at well thought out why the complication of three separate buildings and the consequential underground railway? Terminal is such an unpleasant experience with absolutely no independent lounges and is so congested - pull it down and go back to the drawing board surely there are some competent architects who could make a much better job of it. Other large airports seem to manage it!",
535,T5 in December from and to SFO. Arguably the worst terminal ever designed. Arrival you have to go down three sets of escalators catch a train then go up three sets of escalators. Immigration lines for non-UK passport holders was some 200 people with only 3 immigration officers. Clearing immigration took me 45 minutes. Departure about 50 minutes to clear security and again with the escalators adventure. Nothing modern about this terminal. Will avoid by not flying BA.,
536,Terminal 4 don't understand why this airport receives such bad press. Terminal was busy with several flights to India plus other Asian destinations however there were lots of security channels open and the staff were handling the volume of passengers well and even with a smile. Terminal was clean lots of seats tablets for use if you want WiFi worked well and there was a nice viewing area. All staff I came across were nice and helpful. Lots of retail options available and I found the prices of duty free cheaper than the other airports I've visited in the last couple of weeks (Doha Zurich Paris Bangkok). Plus for those on a budget there's places like Pret Boots WHSmiths etc where the food was the same price as the high street. On return thanks to e-gates was through immigration in 2 minutes bags were out in 5 and was on the tube within 20 minutes of landing. Pretty impressive for an airport the size of Heathrow. I've been to some of the world's best airport (ICN SIN etc) and honestly on this occasions LHR T4 did just as good and needs to be given credit where due.,10.0
537,"Terminal 2. I have used this ""new"" terminal several times now and each time has been an appalling experience. When you see the kind of staff operating the terminal it becomes clear why. My most recent experience this week: I had checked in online electronic boarding pass in hand so I went straight to join the lengthy queue for baggage drop. Oh no you need to queue up at one of the self check-in machines to obtain luggage labels faff about sticking them on and then rejoin the ever lengthening baggage drop queue after being curtly questioned by a miserable looking ""jobsworth"" about your destination. Baggage drop itself was OK the lady even smiled slightly - things were looking up! Next stop security I decided to join one of the shorter queues but this was clearly not allowed as I was immediately blocked by jobsworth number two who had clearly decided on my behalf that I needed to join a much longer queue. I declined his kind offer and got some indecipherable response from him so I just carried on and was through security in no time at all. Caught flight all good. Return flight into T2 last night. Plane landed on time sat on apron near T2 for 10 minutes before pilot announced that the guiding something or other to the bridge had failed and we had to wait for an operator to arrive and guide the aircraft to the stand manually. Whatever it was then took another 20 minutes or so and it was then a case of down the steps onto the wet and windy tarmac up a flight of stairs into the terminal followed by something like a half mile trek involving a mix of operating and non-operating travelators and escalators and lengthy walkways to passport control. At least passport control was fairly quiet and the luggage soon arrived on the belt which unlike my previous T2 experience was actually working. Exit to car park got in lift lift not working. Into next lift not working. Finally made it to car on level 3 in third lift. Got to exit barrier and then had to queue for over 15 minutes due to chaotic mixture of 3 exit lanes going into one and some unfortunate punter having broken down on the exit road. I hate T2 it is almost beyond belief that a new terminal like this has so many faulty operations and so many rude and disenfranchised staff.",2.0
538,Flew from T1 to Lyon. What a shame this terminal is closing as currently it's an oasis of calm. Everything was a breeze from the security to the calm and effective BA lounge. What a joy!,10.0
539,There is now so much focus on retail areas with little or no thought for the average traveling passenger. The retail outlets are all high end and seemed to be lacking customers. So much space is now taken for retail that the is little space to sit down without feeling overcrowded. T5 has a lot of construction going on considering that it is only a few years old. It's not a place you would not want to spend a lot of time in luckily I have access to the BA Lounge so I can escape the main areas however for those without access there is no other choice.,3.0
540,LHR T2 September (for arrival) and last week (for a quite separate departure). Works fine except that the free wifi doesn't work and the free Internet terminals use tablets - which are lousy to type on I think I'd rather pay for a proper implementation of both. This aspect was very frustrating otherwise T2 comes recommended. All the stuff we used to hate about T1 has now been attended to. The airport will also work better once Virgin's domestic flights stop next year - as we won't have to be photographed as well as everything else.,7.0
541,Heathrow 5 is probably the worst airport to transit through I have ever experienced (and I have been through some bad ones in the past). They do not have a proper transit system in operation and you must go through passport control and bag screening even if you are just connecting to another flight. The screeners seemed to be working very slowly at passport control two agents were not taking people and were just chatting even though they could see that there were hundreds of people in line. At bag control they merged transit passengers with new passengers making lines very long. We had over an hour and just made our flight but our bags did not and many passengers missed flights. The English used to know how to run an airport but no longer. I will do everything I can to avoid Heathrow in the future.,
542,Due to various disabilities I flew business class from Washington D C to London Heathrow. Do not do this the cabin crew were fabulous but from the second we landed it was a nightmare. Not enough wheelchairs or staff even after waiting for 15 mins I was not taken to the passport area until nearly an hour later. My husband who had come to collect me checked the landing times and it had been brought forward to 6.07 so he left our home early to drive the two hours to the airport. He was really concerned as even the cabin crew had disembarked and I was no where to be seen. All other airports were fabulous just terminal 5 with its shabby business class lounge and disabled unfriendly seats. BA really lack any duty of care towards disabled passengers once you reach terminal 5.,2.0
543,Arrived at Terminal 5 with BA from HKG and we had to wait 50 minutes for our bags to appear on the carousel! After 40 minutes I went to the baggage desk to ask what was happening and after a few phone calls the BA staff member told me it was 'just busy and it's always like this!' So if it is always that way why hasn't something been done about it? I did notice the flight crews baggage came out first on the carousel!,2.0
544,Terminal 2 - a pleasant experience. Clean efficient free computer tablets to use free half hour wifi amazing stainless steel sculpture. Food is usual rip off England.,9.0
545,Flew to Munich from Terminal 5. Security queues were okay though not very quick. I like the display boards which show which of the two security areas has the shortest queues. Good facilities airside. Had a drink and snack at Gordon Ramsay's where the service was very slow and the price high.,8.0
546,"Landed at terminal 5 at 6.15am on 3rd November on a BA flight from Miami. To say we were ""packed in like sardines"" on the monorail to the immigration and baggage reclaim area is a massive understatement too many people for the area to cope with. Whilst waiting for our cases I visited the ladies toilets. I have to ask what goes on there over night? Certainly no cleaning. They were in a disgusting condition very dirty the floor the toilets everywhere. Empty soap dispensers. I am English and quite well travelled but have never seen airport cloakrooms so bad when arriving home. Just imagine what impression this gives visitors to this country the moment they arrive here.",5.0
547,05h22. Standing at immigration. Long queues! One person handling passports! Ridiculous!,
548,Arrived from Malta at 1910 on the 4th Nov and I was met by a member of staff at the aircraft door as requested - I was then transferred to an electric cart which dropped me off just before immigration so far so good. I was told I would have to wait for someone else to transport me through immigration to the baggage reclaim area. One hour and 10 minutes later they found somebody to take me to the baggage reclaim via immigration. Whilst waiting it was suggested that my wife (62) may like take me while a 30 something man walked beside us as he was not trained to push a wheelchair but would show us the way. I spoke to the manager in charge on the internal telephone who blamed the delay on the immigration and baggage reclaim area but refused to come up with a solution. My wife eventually went ahead to collect the baggage. Overall Heathrow should be ashamed of the way they treat disabled people with contempt but then they are only copying most other public bodies older persons not wanted.,
549,Arrived back into UK on 29 October. Immigration improving for UK passport holders but there needs to be more electronic gates in Terminal 3. 5 is not sufficient to absorb times of high usage. Luggage reclaim was slower than expected.,5.0
550,First time through new T2 and not impressed. Arrived on Air Canada around 10pm. Took forever to taxi to a gate followed by a walk the length of an upper floor of the terminal followed by a very long escalator down to a lower floor and an equally long walk back again. Finally reached passport control. Usual lengthy line for non-EU passports. Fortunately I have a UK passport and headed to the line for the machines (chip passports). Only 3-4 out of maybe 8-9 machines were operational and turns out it was a lot quicker to walk up to an agent where there were no queues (as an aside why are there so many desks for EU-passports that seem very lightly used when the number of desks for non-EU passport seems so inadequate - even in a new terminal?). On return to Canada was fortunate to be able to use priority check-in (very good) and avoid the chaos of general economy check-in. More long walks. AC business lounge is close to the gate miles beyond the main shopping area (there are a couple of shops near the gates but very limited selection). Was expecting a big improvement over T3 but layout seems very poorly thought out. Too bad.,2.0
551,I used Terminal 3 on the evening of 16 October taking the Oman Air flight to Muscat. Given that this is the oldest terminal still in use at Heathrow it was not bad at all. Security was particularly worthy of comment being quick enough (despite the usual clueless customers) and the guy who dealt with me was actually very pleasant. My bag was selected for extra screening - I have no problem with that - which was done swiftly and with some cheerful conversation. I appreciate that Heathrow operates close to full capacity and it does not take much to make it seize up but based purely on this experience there was nothing to stop me recommending the place.,9.0
552,Just awful. Check in system failed. Security incompetent and rude. Fast track is a joke. Third world airport but no one seems to care.,
553,Arrived at new terminal 2 on 15 October. Gate was not ready even though the terminal is not yet fully operational. No ground crew to install chocks etc. Massive long walk to immigration through mile long passages and the longest escalators in the world. Only 2 staff at immigration and biometric machines were not working. How badly designed is this terminal! Why park the planes miles away - I would much prefer buses. Heathrow generally is a disgrace but this new terminal will make is even worse if that is possible.,
554,LHR T5 - Washington Dulles 29 Sept returning 14 October. I read the reports about T5 and wonder whether I have travelled to a different Terminal. Yes - there are tons of unnecessary retail outlets (do they ever make any money ?). Yes - there may be a bit of a queue at security. And exactly what airport doesn't have a queue at security in these modern times ? BUT - if you travel to ANY US port of entry (Washington Newark LAX Chicago Miami etc) you will see just how good Terminal 5 actually is. Alright - it's no Changi at Singapore but it's pretty darn good. Going out we had no queue at bag drop a minimal queue at security and found there are plenty of quiet corners to find seats away from the stretch of retails outlets. Coming back on 13th October we had to get the shuttle train to passport control and baggage reclaim but were through the electronic passport control claimed our baggage got our car from the Meet and Greet in the Short Term car park and were on the M25 heading North in 45 minutes. No complaints from me about Heathrow Terminal 5.,9.0
555,Terminal 2 is a nightmare - new terminal that does not deliver! Long! long! walks from aircraft to central area and no airbridge operators 2 out of 4 arrivals in 2 weeks.,1.0
556,I recently transited on a long haul trip from the US to India. I flew with BA using their hub at Heathrow Terminal 5. I was very impressed and happy with the terminal. I saw Heathrow after almost a decade and the improvement is quite marked. Terminal Five is a magnificent terminal ultramodern with excellent cleanliness and facilities with very professional and helpful staff. The airport has an excellent selection of shops and restaurants. What I like most about Heathrow were the staff especially the purple coated helpers whose job is to assist and guide passengers. They should have more quiet sleeping areas at the airport. Right now the only sleeping areas in the airport offer hard benches suitable for resting not sleeping. I also think lounges for pay for the use of Economy passengers would be a help to make the place for attractive for long haul flyers. All in all a good airport experience a huge improvement from a decade ago.,10.0
557,Transit through Terminal 5 is an ordeal and a dreadful welcome for visitors to our country. The management of passengers through security is nothing short of disgraceful. The airport management at senior level should decide what is more important a stress-free passage for passengers through security or to continue to open more retail outlets. At the moment it appears that the emphasis is to get passengers to spend more at the retail outlets than to establish a stress-free passage through security. With good logistical management this problem could be avoided.,3.0
558,Yet another disappointing experience at T5. Arrived at c gates. My connecting flight's gate not yet known. So had to get shuttle to section a. Very busy and like rush hour on the underground. Then waited at section a until gates shown - plenty of seats but seems so full and busy - nowhere pleasant to wait. Why no lounge for paying passengers as at the other terminals? Only BA preferred customers have that facility. Then another shuttle trip to b gates. Limited facilities there and seating around gate areas mediocre. Could learn from other airports which I used on the current trip - Johannesburg and LAX. BA and BAA and T5 not a good advert for wanting to travel via the UK.,5.0
559,Heathrow one of the largest airports world-wide and a disgrace short staffed no wheelchairs available for my travelling companion who has trouble walking whilst waiting for the wheelchair we missed our flight to Manchester - leading to a delay of over 4 hours till the next flight We had no problems with Airports in Chicago New York and Las Vegas who where top class. Get your act together Heathrow. And to top my first experience of ever using Heathrow arriving in Manchester my suitcase did not arrive with me. Next time I go direct from Manchester.,2.0
560,Took our son to term 2 last night. Chaos reigned at A counters. One was encouraged to print own bag check etc and then you had to join another queue. The machine would only print one of his boarding passes so he was not allowed to drop bag drop queue he had to join the special assistance queue. 50 minutes later he got to see a person and they checked his bags and printed the second boarding pass. He had checked in online the previous day with Singapore Airlines. Term 2 had grouped all the airlines together and so no individual queues for the airline you were travelling on. It has never been as bad as this in the last 40 years we have travelled through Heathrow. Who's so called bright idea was to lump groups of airlines together. The staff had to keep taking people out of the queues as they were going to miss their flights as the gates close an hour before take off. Shame this lovely new building cannot have proper facilities for the travelling passengers. Everyone says Heathrow is the worst airport in the world so why can they not do something about it. Better management is called for and more staff at busy times is needed.,
561,Sept 22 early am arrival from the US. I do not think I have cleared any airport I have travelled to faster than this. Zipped through Immigration and Fast Track - was in lounge about 15 minutes after leaving the plane. It can work apparently. The recommendation would have to be for this experience as many were not so good.,10.0
562,September 22 2014. I had a one hour international connection at T5. Everything went smoothly I was put in the priority line for both immigration and security. I made my connecting flight London-San Francisco with no problems.,10.0
563,When flying Virgin Atlantic from Terminal 3 be aware that the gates are a 20 minute walk from the security check point and there are NO food or beverage services at the gates. Layout appears designed to extract the last few pounds before leaving London.,5.0
564,Terminal 5. The security checks carried out by Border Security is just ridiculous disorganised not enough desks open or staff available it was abysmal. We travelled back into the UK from San Francisco at the US end the security checks are more organised quicker and more efficient. They are set up to handle volume not Heathrow T5 it is a joke will not be going there again. Take my advice stay clear use other airlines even go to Amsterdam to go to the US not Heathrow T5.,
565,Taxis. Anyone wanting a black cab especially late at night not wanting to go into central London beware of the shambles that is the queue for cabs. It is managed but you may find that when it comes to your turn the cabbie won't be interested or will want a fare out of proportion to the journey distance (it's to do with the stupid licensing arrangement they have from TFl's taxis dept) leaving you having wasted your time. The queue operative may approach cabs further down the line - but no guarantee that other drivers will take you either. Seems that a lot don't have card readers in their cabs either. There are private hire taxis in the terminal - my advice is to use one of those instead and it may well be much cheaper.,
566,"Transited through LHR to JFK from KUL and the airport has good connections for flights to various parts of the world. However they need to improve on the security screening and its staff. I noticed that the staff were ""selective"" in the passengers who had to undergo additional screening based on stereotypes according to my observation. The transfer desk and security at Terminal 4 could do with some improvements on their tone of voice (when dealing with certain passengers) as well as the building interior itself. Terminal 5 is a nice terminal and is more systematic. Bus transfers were efficient. Free internet limited to 45 minutes only at LHR.",6.0
567,Flew from T2 Heathrow to Newark New Jersey and the staff and atmosphere could not have been more different. The T2 staff were polite and helpful (unlike the Newark staff on arrival who were rude and arrogant). There appeared to be an abundance of staff within the duty free area and restaurants who were extremely pleasant and helpful which made for a great start to our city break. Would definitely be happy to fly from this terminal again.,9.0
568,We were changing planes from a flight from South Africa to a flight to the US. We didn't know we would have to go through airport security and I absent-mindedly kept a water bottle in my carry-on. This meant they had to go through every item in my luggage while insulting me for not knowing the rules. They also decided to go through my wife's carry-on because it had an odd-shaped object. But first we had to wait while they went through half a dozen other people's carry-ons extremely slowly occasionally taking a break to do something else. The lady in front of us missed her plane because of the long wait. They seemed to be deliberately slow and deliberately rude. In the future we shall book all our European trips through Amsterdam instead of London.,
569,T2 to and from Cork. Absolutely no complaints short walk to check-in short walk through security (but there seems to be some problems with the photo ID system - photo taken at entrance caused problems at boarding - no idea why) staff courteous I have a replacement hip but I was dealt with easily. Very quiet in the lounge area - was a Sunday lunchtime a decent selection of places to eat - recommend London's Pride. Lots of seats but what it will be like when fully occupied maybe a problem. Return was easy short if somewhat convoluted walk to the baggage hall no border controls to worry about waited maybe 20 minutes for the baggage to arrive. Then finally short walk to the short stay car park. It is 42 years since I first flew from (the old) T2; but this is how terminals should be.,9.0
570,T5. Considering the numbers they do a pretty good job. BA strict about not checking in too early (3 hours) but I parked myself at a coffee shop to wait. Lines in ok. Nice food options bit of shopping all clean and tidy. Airport staff positioned in busy areas to help. Gordon Ramsey restaurant is great! I always stop there on route. Security is pretty strict but considering most pax act like they've never left the country (leaving coats on change in pockets etc) they do a good job.,9.0
571,Customs queues are some of the slowest I have seen. Terrible. It can be expected to wait up to an hour to get through if you don't have a British passport - and this is coming from someone with permanent residency here.,2.0
572,Flew out of and back into Heathrow for a flight to France. Checked in within under a minute. Short wait at scanners but no queue at immigration on return. Good range of restaurants but very expensive shops as always and terrible queues in WH Smiths.,8.0
573,Arrived back from Canada yesterday flying into T2 Heathrow. The distances between gate and the border are ridiculous funny how departure seemed easier than arrival. Border lines long as expected but went through the electronic gates which worked but could have done without the three women who were overseeing the gates. They looked very stressed and acted like it. The baggage reclaim however is fundamentally flawed. The baggage carousel does not work. The new system is supposed to stop bags entering the belt electronically stopping bags until there is a space on the belt. If there isn't a space then the bags stop coming up from the handlers below. As the flight had a lot of people waiting to go through the border we stood and waited until someone reclaimed their bags and another one could enter the belt. Eventually a couple of baggage workers arrived and started moving the bags on the belt to make space for other bags. Clearly the bags were being held below and they were trying to sort it out. I chatted with them and it seems that this happens all the time. TIP! Push the bags together if you can you are more likely to get your bags in a decent time frame. Very disappointing.,3.0
574,Terminal 2 on day 5 of Turkish Airlines occupation. Had to wait on taxi-way for 20 minutes because our gate was occupied - don't get that there were many unoccupied gates. Our gate was a 20 minute hike to the central areas - given the lack of occupancy would have been nicer if we'd been closer in.. Almost no people around (4pm on a Monday) so no queues at Immigration and the eGates worked well and quickly - maybe 10 seconds to clear Passport control! Then an hour for our luggage. The belt started. Then stopped. Then started again and some bags appeared. But then it stopped again for about half an hour. An engineer came and moved some bags around on the feeders and eventually all was good. A frustrating end to a good week's holiday and a very poor first experience of the new LHR T2. I know they'll fix it in the end but right now I couldn't recommend T2 as a gateway to the world.,2.0
575,Slow slow slow security and passport queues at Heathrow (and we were British Passport holders). Departing LAX everything went smoothly the Americans seem so much better than us at handling airport security and they don't see the need for laptops to be taken out of bags so why do we here in the UK? Long queues here at Heathrow whilst transferring from the inbound international flight to transfer to our domestic departure to Manchester. As a BA customer we were eligible to use the fast track section but that didn't speed things up because the security staff not coping at all well just opened that up to all passengers simply making things worse. One security lady wasn't even able to track which passengers were putting which bags on the x-ray machine belt. If possible don't transfer via Heathrow!,3.0
576,Terminal 2. We were on a day trip to London for football match. This was our first trip using T2 as Aer Lingus have just moved there from T1. What a shock to find a spacious clean modern terminal! Both arriving and departing were pleasant experiences by airport standards. We had no luggage but security had plenty of open lanes and chatty friendly staff. We had checked in online so have no knowledge of the check in facilities. Plenty of dining options. The only problem was that the signs told us 'please wait' and gave no gate details. It was only when a announcement was made that anyone knew where to go. Apart from that T2 was great and we will not miss the nightmare of T1 with the twenty minute trudge to the backside of nowhere to wait in a glorified tin hut!,9.0
577,Well this is a very busy airport with a lot of terminals gates facilities and a lot of really interested shops. At our arrival there was a huge queue for visa and passport examination and that should be organised better. Five or six desks didn't work and that number that is present at terminal four just isn't enough for all those people there. Something else that I didn't like was some kind of form that you have to fill in while waiting there are no tables or desks when you can put a pen and form while filling it so you have to fill it in while standing and/or walking in the line. There is no sign that you need to fill that in there are just a few spots to take those forms (and to take them you have to step out of line). After a two-hour long wait we finally finished with that queue and went to baggage claim where again are no signs for which flight is which baggage claim terminal. Fortunately one assistant helped us with that. On flight back home things were much more pleasant everything was quick well-marked there is a lot of duty-free shops and of course there is a lot of stuff members all polite and ready to help. Airport is connected with Tube station by elevator which is well marked and good because a lot of people take the subway. If you are visiting London this is a good airport but if you change your flight Heathrow isn't that good solution maybe Gatwick or even Paris or Brussels airport will be fine.,9.0
578,I have been travelling throughout Europe and UK for 2 months. I have had the misfortune to have had to enter the UK through Heathrow airport. The processing of arrivals is disgraceful and extremely inefficient. On the first occasion it took over an hour to get through UK border. I write this review as I am standing in line for over 1 hour now and I have just reached the sign that tells me it will take at least another half an hour. This is pathetic for a country like the UK to show the world how hopeless you are at organisation . I will never return to the UK through Heathrow again it's a disgrace. It's mid afternoon on Tuesday 26th August 2014 and still Heathrow cannot cope with the people coming to this country in an efficient manner. Never experienced anything like this at any other airport. Wake up and get better. Everywhere else can do it better than you.,
579,T3 the check in was good but there it ends once in the hands of the security screening it is nothing short of pathetic. Primary screening is very slow staff seem to keep changing jobs so everything stops while they very leisurely swap positions. There seem to be lots of staff just standing around doing nothing to relieve the chronic congestion and about every third passenger gets picked for secondary hand luggage screen which is manned by just one person so expect about another 30 minutes delay. The large percentage of secondary screening suggests either Heathrow passengers are particularly naive about what is allowed or the screening staff and or the equipment needs a good upgrade because this level of now the manual search I have not experienced anywhere else. I watched this process for some waiting on the change of the guard and it involves every single item being removed in search of I am not sure what because I didn't see anything confiscated. Then a swab is taken and taken to a machine about as far away from the search point as possible so more delay.,2.0
580,On itself T4 isn't too bad however immigration is a nightmare. When these e-passport gates Do not work prepare having to queue for a long time. Airside service in shops can be really bad. Staff really do not care and do they even speak English? The good thing is there's a smokers area!,4.0
581,The congestion problem at the security has multiple causes. 1) The gender-gated system of having one male and one female officer to screen persons coming through the gate is wildly inefficient. Any single exceptional case such as an artificial joint leads to that agent being dedicated to that single passenger while every other passenger of the same gender must wait at the gate - this can lead to dozens of one gender just standing there at the scanner gate while the bags pile up at the other end of the belt. Anyone with the slightest math competence can tell you that simply passing on the exceptional passengers to a SEPARATE line and letting the non-exceptional passengers continue would materially enhance passenger flow. Both of my recent times exceeded 30 minutes which gives the lie to their claim to clear 95% in 10 minutes at peak times. 2) It's astonishing that a newish terminal could be designed in such a way that the security lines overwhelm the space available for queuing. Chaotic. 3) The security staff do not seem happy in their work which leads to coarse brittle behavior by them.,
582,Clearing Customs at Terminal 5 was appalling this morning (Monday 18th August 2014). We only had one Customs representative for the first half an hour for both EU and International arrivals! To make matters worse she gave priority to the EU line! When a second customs representative arrived she too gave priority to the EU line making several international arrivals late for their planes. I myself was stopped from going through when an EU customer just happened to arrive. When I chipped them they were very rude and unapologetic. Full marks however to a lovely lady who as a Customs representative tried her level best to ensure people were attended to in order despite their being several queues. This poor lady was visibly embarrassed and quite ashamed of her work colleagues for their rude and unprofessional behaviour.,
583,"Terminal 1 - Bag Drop. 10 Aug 17.00 hr - horribly long queue - we could not believe what we saw in a ""modern"" airport. It takes 45 minutes plus just for bag drop. Staff told us it is always like this. Just awful! After this long wait a very long walk to departure gate which was in Terminal 2.",1.0
584,I'm not sure if I'm particularly lucky or that the reviewers are being particularly picky but I find travelling through T5 remarkably civilised and trouble-free. Went out to Shanghai on 25/7 - an extremely busy day but had no issues at all with check-in or security. No delays. Coming back on 9/8 was the same story - through passport control and a short wait for bags. More than satisfied.,10.0
585,Departed London Heathrow (LHR) terminal 2 on 22/07/2014. Arrived terminal 1 12/08/2014. Arrived at T2 over 3 hours before departure. Good signage to indicate check in zones. Check-in for Star Alliance flights is generic and the entire process was chaotic with passengers about to miss their flight being constantly pulled out of the snaking queue system and fast tracked to a check-in desk. Despite it being the 1st week of school summer holidays and 5 Star Alliance flights checking-in simultaneously not all check-in desks were manned. Check in staff were minimally communicative. Eventually got checked in then came the security 'experience'. Long queues for security. My cabin bag was selected for further checks which required a further long wait as there were several bags selected for further checks and just 1 member of staff doing this - in the 1st week of school summer holidays! The additional security checks on my back-pack must have taken about 40 minutes by the time the 1 member of staff got to my bag had checked everything swabbed everything put the swab through the ionmiser re-xrayed everything and then I had to re-pack everything. Eventually completed security clearance had a quick trip to the toilets (clean) and got to departure gate with about 10 minutes to spare. At departure gate a sullen non-communicative member of ground handling staff. Airbridge was broken so down two flights of stairs and walk to aircraft. On arrival on 12/08 after spending an extraordinary amount of time going around in circles above London we eventually landed followed by a very long taxi to airbridge. Good signage in terminal. Clean and plentiful toilets. Very long walk to T1 UK border from where aircraft parked. Reasonable queues at UK border handled by pleasant UK border staff. Baggage reclaim no problems as baggage already on carousel when we got there. The final insult: sitting in the grid-locked traffic at about 22:45 outside of T1 car park for about 15 minutes wondering why we're not moving. My advice: if departing T2 get there at least 3 hours before hand (preferably more) and hope that you can just about make it to your flight or better yet avoid LHR T2 if at all possible.,1.0
586,"Connection from T3 to T5 at 0600 on a Friday. Inbound flight was delayed 75 mins leaving 30-odd minutes from aircraft door opening to gate opening at T5. Knowing Heathrow I was not at all confident of making it - indeed I assumed we wouldn't. Flight connections signing was good and the transfer area was actually quite efficient with buses seemingly frequent although a painfully slow journey it did take the promised 10 minutes. Into T5 and a bit of quick thinking got us into the fast-track at the id check saving 10 minutes queuing time. Security was not very busy but was very slow although staff were polite enough. Passengers seemed mostly at fault for the speed of things as only about 1 in 5 makes any effort to ""get ready"" leading to lots of opening and rummaging for things in bags before the x-ray. A sprint down to gate A10 and another bus journey took us back where we'd just come from but we'd made the connection - in something like 40 minutes plane to plane. However it felt like it was despite not because of the airport.",6.0
587,I was picking a foreign language student up from LHR on Sunday 20th July. The flight was from Berlin. It was chaos! Obviously the airport must have been aware that this was one of the busiest times for them as hundreds of foreign schools were waiting to collect English Language students to go to schools all over the country. We arrived at 13.00. Our student's flight was listed to arrive at 13.50. After about an hor the flight disappeared from the screen. We eventually found someone to ask and he said it was delayed. The passengers were all taking at least two hours to pick up their luggage! We eventually left the airport about six o'clock and parking had cost us a fortune. What s going on at London Airport? What an example to foreign visitors!,
588,Arrived mid morning from DFW at T3 on American Airlines. Disembarkation was fast we were through immigration in no time with all desks manned and luggage on belt within 10 mins of us getting through border control. Extremely fast and efficient as has always been my experience at Heathrow in recent years.,9.0
589,We were held up going through security and when a bag was side-tracked as being 'suspicious' were forced to wait quite a while as they were 'rotating' - the desk was un-manned for several minutes between 'shifts' and a queue of people was developing. Staff are obviously busy but their surly approach does not make for a comfortable time. Also the body scanner seemed completely out of kilter as it kept on alerting even though I was wearing cotton underclothes and cotton on top - no metal at all. They suggested that my glasses were the problem but they are plastic frames. The staff person on decided then to re-calibrate it but it was totally unnecessary to be exposed to that as there was no good reason for it. We also noticed a lack of facilities - after a long day leading up to our arrival at the airport we were surprised and disappointed to find that there are no shower or washing facilities available - only the normal toilets which are not suitable for the purpose.,5.0
590,LHR is a national disgrace. Travelled to T1 from Marseille on several Sunday evenings this year. Almost every arrival has been poor including baggage delay of 30 minutes because of the 'arrival of several aircraft ' (there's a surprise) stranded on the plane for over 30 minutes because there were no steps no gate available. On most occasions arrival involves disembarking into the terminal and then back out again and on to a bus. Is this really how an international airport should be run? This is not a four star airport - just look at the reviews.,1.0
591,Our LOT flight ex-WAW landed punctually and taxied to the gate at 21.40 but LHR ground staff did not appear for fully 15 minutes. The exasperated flight attendant said this was typical. Once let off the plane we found ourselves in a deserted T2 but were routed to T1 for passport control and baggage reclaim - a walk of a further 15+ minutes. To reinforce the joy of the BAA experience at LHR I then paid the extortionate GBP 23 for a one-way Heathrow Express ticket to Paddington.,4.0
592,Was travelling back to Singapore after a 2 week holiday in UK and Paris. We took 5 flights to and from T5 during our holiday. This last one was our 6th flight. We were all very tired when we got to the airport. We arrived with 3 hours to spare. We tried using the self service check in kiosk even though it never worked on our previous flights. Of course this time it didn't work again. So off we went to counter B1 for assistance. There were only 3 groups before us in that queue so we thought it won't take us long. How wrong we were. One group took 5-10 mins which was ok but the second one took over 50 mins. To make matters worse after this group finally left the staff at the counter attended to a big group which wasn't even in the queue. Of course we were not happy and moved away. My husband decided to ask the staff at self service check in kiosk to help us check in. She was attending to my husband when my kids and I joined him. She had obviously checked in some of us and then asked for the passport of the fourth person without telling me who she has already checked in because I wasn't there. I gave her the wrong passport and that's when she started talking to me condescendingly. She threatened not to proceed with checking me in. By that time my kids and husband had already been checked in I had a lot more to say to her but had to hold my tongue as all I wanted was to be checked in and get on my flight. Were finally checked in after 1.5 hrs. Just as well we arrived early. I am so shocked with how bad the service is and how the staff can get away with it. Of course our BA flight to Singapore was delayed like all other flights that we took during our holiday. This time it was delayed for 3 hours. 2 hours of that we were stuck in the plane. Have promised ourselves not to fly BA in the future if it means going through T5. Worst experience ever.,1.0
593,We arrived at Terminal 4 amidst a downpour and our taxi dropped us off at the drop zone. Having paid him an exorbitant fee for the fare because the M25 was clogged up we were then exposed to the torrential rain in the time it took us to find a trolley and wheel all our luggage up to the terminal doors. By the time we got there we were all soaked to the skin. I looked around and discovered we had no chance of seeking any cover or protection from the weather as there wasn't any until you reached the terminal. Surely this is ridiculous as winter rain would be just as bad. Not happy at all. I for one will be avoiding Heathrow in the future not only because of this but the M25 is a continual joke.,1.0
594,We traveled through Heathrow on 7/18/14 passing through from Stuttgart on our way to Dallas. Due to a late arrival our connection time was shortened to a little over an hour. We transferred easily from Terminal 5 to Terminal 3 although it takes about 15 minutes by bus to do so. However the security screening at Terminal 3 was completely unacceptable. First of all there were only 2 lines open. Secondly once it was our turn our bags were placed into a tub and then abandoned. Simply left on the belt and everyone walked away. I asked several times for someone to process us and was told someone was on their way. Several security personnel were simply standing around doing nothing. I then went to the supervisor's desk and demanded that someone process us. He told me to stop shouting at him and that he had dispatched someone. Again we waited. I explained again that we had a flight to catch. No one was interested in the least in this. Then an agent took our tub and moved it forward to a table. Then another agent came. All these agents moved at snail speed. It was like a bad movie. No one was friendly not to mention displayed any sense of urgency whatsoever. The agent then carried our tub very slowly to another desk and proceeded to review our bags. We had a pasta machine brand new unopened in the box. This then needed to be taken apart examined it might have been a weapon and only when yet another agent a supervisor and the only person with any sense in that whole bunch said that it was ok were we permitted to pack everything up and proceed. I was absolutely furious. We were on our way to Dallas and arriving in the US was a breath of fresh air everyone there was friendly we processed quickly. The staff in London should be ashamed. This is the absolutely worst airport ever. They really could not have cared less.,
595,"Departed from Terminal 2 on EVA air. Was excited to visit the new airport with high hopes it would be like T5 but what a great disappointment. The check in area was airy but not as grand as T5. It's clean and basic. There were only two cafes/bar before security - A Costa and a Weatherspoon. There is also a very tiny travel shop. When we entered the check in area it was empty - not many airlines have moved to T2. There was a very polite and friendly gentleman from the airport at the entrance to give you direction and guidance. I assume because it's not occupied solely by one airlines like T5 does the check in desks seem to be more ""traditional"" and less inviting. Most of the airlines are using self check in and bag tag printing service which might save time for some but not for all. Perhaps the airport was still new and not used by many airlines and we also arrived very early the check in was very smooth and fast. Security was also fast but it will be interesting to see what happens when all airlines move in. The check in agent warned us its a long walk to get to the gate. It turned out to be a reasonable walk just a lot of stairs/escalators going up and down. There are not many dining and shopping options in the terminal either. The signature restaurant was a big disappointment. Food was boring and plain. Shopping is also very weak. All in all it's a clean and new airport. If you are flying short haul with no requirement for check in or eating/drinking/shopping it might work well.",3.0
596,"Travelled with Air Canada from the brand new LHR terminal 2. We checked in online the day before our flight and had our electronic boarding passes and arrived at terminal 2 expecting to just drop our bags off as per usual. Upon arrival we informed quite rudely that even though we had already checked in and had our boarding passes we still had to use a self service machine to obtain our baggage tags and then drop our bags off. So we used the machines and my partners passport wouldn't scan properly so he could not get his baggage tags. We were told by the assistant that it was probably because the surname was too long on the passport (strange reason) and that in order to get a baggage tag we had to join the ""check in assistance"" line which was huge and check in his bags there. I was also told that because I had my baggage tags I had to join a different line and drop my bags off there because as I had already printed my baggage tags I would not be allowed to drop off my bags at check in assistance with my partners bags - cue Benny Hill music. So I dropped my bags off and then rejoined my partner in his line turns out a lot of people were having having problems with the self service machines not reading people's passports properly. After 30 minutes wait we eventually reached the counter and explained the situation to the agent who was so rude and basically said ""not my fault the machines don't read your passport and that we should complain to Air Canada"". So in the old terminal 3 you checked in online and dropped your bags off but in the new brand sparkly terminal 2 you still have to use the self service machines and proceed to drop off but god help you if the machines don't work because the staff will not help you!",4.0
597,"I have flown from the US to Europe many times and my experience at London Heathrow Airport was horrible. The airport itself was difficult and to top it off having to deal with the ""lady"" at security was a nightmare. As I said before this is not my first time flying to Europe or even a London airport. The treatment I received while going through security was disrespectful and flat out rude. I realize security at airports are in some regards different but when you are being talked about while you are less than two feet away from this ""lady"" as if you are stupid is reprehensible and to be called a ""moaner"" and being accused of ""moaning"" about the security procedures because you are from the USA. As my bag finally made it through security I was standing in front of the metal detector she says ""I hope you have a nice flight and forces a smile. I looked at her and replied ""I will once I get out of here."" This was by far the worst experience I have ever had at an airport and if I have any control over flying through London or staying in London I will never fly through London Heathrow again.",
598,What were they thinking when they designed this airport? Having everyone walk a gauntlet of high priced shops through a narrow corridor pulling luggage is just plain stupid. Inadequate and confusing signage throughout. Complete lack of information kiosks. At the entrance to some of the escalators there were barriers that forced you to turn sideways to pull your roller board through. Seating in the waiting area only a very small percentage of seats could view the departure monitors. The degree of walking waiting and confusion is equalled only by some airports in 3rd world countries. This was one of the most frustrating and ill conceived airports I have ever been in. For shame England. Is the really the best you could do?,2.0
599,I have been flying through LHR Terminal 5 two to four times per month for the last 11 months and would have continued to do so for the next year. However my experiences at T5 have been dreadful - long queues for Border Control and Security. So much so that I cannot rely on two hours being sufficient to get from an inbound international flight to a domestic connection. Border Control staff are impassive and unhelpful but BAA staff are downright rude inefficient and ill-informed. Schiphol can manage 45 minutes gate to gate - are very friendly and obviously want my business. Likewise Newark. It is obvious that the Border and Security facilities at T5 are inadequate for the numbers passing through but a look at other airports would show that significant improvements could be made with little investment - moving a barrier here; moving a machine there; better training and utilization of the existing facilities and staff.,

603,"This is the worst airport I have travelled through. I have travelled the world extensively and have never encountered such rudeness or disorganisation. We travelled with British Airways (who were fine) and were using Heathrow as a transit stop only (this time). Despite being in transit we waited in multiple queues and 2 hours into our transit with only 1 hour to go I asked a staff member ""Are we going to make this flight"". The response was simply ""No"". There was no help either to make the flight or to help us if we missed the flight there was no apology and there was no express queue available to people with short transit times. The staff in general were highly rude un-helpful and despite there being a lot of staff members they were standing around doing nothing. There was only one security check station open lots of redundant staff members and copious amounts of travellers standing around for 2-3 hours waiting to get through. Unless you are actually wanting to enter London do not transit through Heathrow CDG is a much better choice and the staff are delightful. If you need to enter London I would seriously consider flying into CDG anyway and then getting the Channel Tunnel Train.",
604,Transferred from T1 to T3 on 24 May and T3 to T1 on 8 June. Bit of a nightmare - lots of walking backwards and forwards - down one long corridor and then back up to same one separated by a glass partition pretty unhelpful staff several of whom did not seem to know where to direct us. One person fairly aggressively claimed we were going the wrong way and wanted to turn us back when we wanted to enter flight connections (we did have the right to go there) - a less experienced traveller could easily have accepted his reprimand found themselves land side and had to recheck in and pass security and maybe missing their flight. Also inter terminal bus journey not comfortable or pleasant. Would only recommend if no alternative existed (or being the optimist if the new T2 makes things a lot better).,3.0
605,Not the worst airport in Europe but giving Paris CDG a run for the bottom place. June 26 the luggage system is down all officials concerned with acting stuffy and official not in helping. Security staff that confuse inefficiency with thoroughness BA their usual incompetent selves (is this what unionizing does to customer service?). A place to avoid at all costs! Plus most public space is taken up by expensive duty free a clear misnomer.,1.0
606,Arrived from US at 6.40 am on June 11 with no checked luggage on my way to London and didn't get through Border Control until 8.25 am. It took over 45 minutes to get to the sign that said that we could expect to wait 45 minutes from that point. There appeared to be only two agents checking in our very long line until 8 am when more agents arrived and after chatting obliviously behind the check-in stations for a bit started speeding things up. This wait time was even worse than the 1 hour+ wait when I visited in 2012. My last trip to the UK went through Heathrow and ended in Edinburgh where the Border Control experience was much more reasonable. This experience was disgraceful.,
607,Whilst my own experience with Heathrow was relatively pain free I felt quite ashamed at what I was witnessing happening to other people transiting through the airport. I was connecting from a flight arriving at Terminal 3 to a domestic departure from Terminal 5. The bus transfer between the terminals was pain free and just involved a lot of walking. It was the Border controls and security that had me quite ashamed of what for some people is the only view they get of the UK. I moved through the EU passport border quite quickly but witnessed a large queue for the International passport border trapped with a very rude member of staff not explaining why they were there all of them getting visibly upset and all this staff member would do is tell them to be quiet and wait with no clear view of what they were waiting for. The border agency staff seemed stressed which isn't reassuring. Moving onto security well this was a shambles the staff were not explaining what some passengers should do and then being very rude if they went through the scanners with a belt on the bag scanners were incredibly slow with large build up of people waiting for the bag to come through the other side all the time the staff just seemed to stand there and do nothing looking incredibly bored like it was some kind of torture to be there. We all know Heathrow is under a lot of strain but sorting out the border and security would make it a lot more pleasant experience to pass through.,3.0
608,Terminal 4 was yet again a nightmare for me. Being disabled with breathing problems I had asked for a wheelchair from the plane. I had flown in from Goa via Mumbai and had no problems and so much help until yet again I reached Heathrow. No wheelchairs and about a dozen or so people waiting for help. Eventually some buggies came and I was told the chair would meet me at immigration. How wrong that was. From there I was left to struggle through immigration baggage reclaim and customs. I asked why the chairs were not there and was told they don't have enough and couldn't find any. At least it was better than last time on the 25th February. Then there were no wheelchairs or trolleys and they couldn't find them as they were all outside. I was left to struggle and no help whatsoever. Disgusted with Heathrow Terminal 4. Very poor customer service.,

I had flown in from Goa via Mumbai and had no problems and so much help until yet again I reached Heathrow. No wheelchairs and about a dozen or so people waiting for help. Eventually some buggies came and I was told the chair would meet me at immigration. How wrong that was. From there I was left to struggle through immigration baggage reclaim and customs. I asked why the chairs were not there and was told they don't have enough and couldn't find any. At least it was better than last time on the 25th February. Then there were no wheelchairs or trolleys and they couldn't find them as they were all outside. I was left to struggle and no help whatsoever. Disgusted with Heathrow Terminal 4. Very poor customer service.,
611,Impossibly long queuing in Terminal 5 international connections every time - at least one and quarter from arrival to gate of departing flight. No time for shopping dining without angst. 4 times through and still not clearly organized traffic flow backed up to exit from arriving gate etc. Anyway this might be improved with better foot traffic flow management? Otherwise abominable.,2.0
612,"I too will try to avoid Heathrow in future. My bags got caught up in the June 6th baggage system ""IT issue"" and I still have no word on them one week later. They were to have been delivered on June 8th to Rome but then BA cancelled that flight and no one at Rome airport or at Heathrow seems to know what happened to them even as I was leaving Rome to return to London. Then my connection back to London was cancelled with only a message to ""ring if you want to re-book"" - totally unacceptable given that I had a connection from LHR to Dulles and it was clearly visible in the system. I am Emerald One World and am on a Business Class Round the World ticket and that is the treatment? I will try to go via other airports and avoid BA in future.",
613,Arrived T4 to collect relative on flight from China. Heathrow and airline live boards online both showed plane on time at 15.25. Flight arrival board shows expected 17.56! Over a two hour delay. We are now stuck at airport paying exorbitant parking fees for probably 3 hours. There is no desk to complain to. Just told by member if staff to register a complaint online. The web was updated at 15.40. Did they suddenly realise the plane was missing? Not good enough Heathrow.,
614,Terminal 1. Totally under-staffed at the security area. We waited 40 minutes as they pulled both our hand luggage off. One staff member and they were checking nearly every passenger with a carry on suitcase. Very slowly. 25 minute walk to our SAA flight. Why on earth would you move the gate to Terminal 2 when it is not open. Disgraceful. 2 hours to check in clear security and get to the gate. No-one checked our passports until we boarded the plane. T5 is far more efficient.,
615,T5 returning from Mumbai. Was out of the plane through immigration collected bags and was in my car in the car park within 45 minutes. How good is that! I think it's one of the those places where your view is governed entirely based to the specific experience you had on your last trip. For me it was perfect.,9.0
616,The first toilets on landing at Terminal 3 were an absolute disgrace - filthy overloaded bins dryer not working locks on doors broken. One of our party is disabled and required assistance which was ok from the plane to Terminal 3 but then left in lounge with no idea of when she would be collected and taken to passport control and to collect her luggage. We were unable to help her as no one had any idea of how to contact the disabled lounge. She eventually hobbled out on her own and was rescued by passport control. I will never use Heathrow again.,2.0
617,Heathrow is in short a mess. Getting around is a confusing mishmash of walkways corridors escalators and busses. Signage is clear but the airport is nevertheless extremely difficult to navigate efficiently. I have never seen so many people racing through a terminal apparently trying to navigate the complicated layout numerous times to find where they should be. I am fortunate to usually travel business class so I can avoid the cavernous dirty hot noisy and smelly main waiting areas in favor of a private airline lounge. The terminals seem to be organized to generate sales at the stores and restaurants and not for passenger comfort or convenience. Immigration lines are very long and extremely slow which seems to be a problem at airports everywhere. For anyone changing to a domestic flight I would recommend at least 3 hours transit time. Several times baggage claim has been a single carousel serving many flights crowded with hundreds of people. The ensuing chaos makes for understandably frayed nerves and short tempers. Did I mention the airport is dirty? I have noticed on the London subway that the locals just leave trash everywhere but in trash cans and they do the same at Heathrow. Unfortunately it appears to be picked up infrequently.,3.0
618,"Arrived at Terminal One Heathrow 1.30 pm 1 June 2014 . Seemed like a 2 mile walk to immigration long wait then half a mile walk to baggage reclaim. Small room and 300+ people waiting around a single carousel. Had to wait 60 minutes for baggage to come off and at first only 1 bag every 30 seconds or so. Explanation for wait was that there were ""staff problems."" No other explanation forthcoming. This airport is an absolute disgrace! Filthy dirty airport heat stifling. Took 90 minutes to collect my bag. Staff non-existent. My partner is disabled and almost fainted. I will never fly out of this airport again.",
619,Arriving at Terminal 5 to transit from Geneva to Phoenix. Delayed 1 hour due to windy conditions. Extremely slow waiting time at the security check. Useless steward was calling gates for every single passenger to check whether it was closed instead of grouping passengers in priority order. We had to explain her to make sure we could catch the flight. As usual poor transit conditions and poor communications/service. I will make sure I avoid transiting via LHR as much as possible.,

621,Terminal 5 LHR Fast Track Security is an absolute shambles we waited for over 45 minutes to get through Fast Track last Monday 19 May I know security are not part of British Airways but really it does make you think twice about using T5. I appreciate there is a need for security but when they are just standing around talking & appear to be in no rush I guess it makes TSA look good. British Airways need to be aware that the poor customer service is a reflection on them so they do need to ensure there is a level of customer service set in line with their excellent customer service BA provide. The other area which is annoying is the amount of walking to go from Fast Track which is next to the BA Lounge to then walk halfway down the terminal only to double back on yourself. We all know it is a ploy to get passengers to walk through the numerous shopping outlets which the majority of business passengers ignore so come on BA & BAA allow the business passenger direct access to the BA Lounges next to Fast Track as most of us have no interest in buying anything from the shops in T5.,2.0
622,Queuing time for security check on Sunday 12 May was unacceptable. Extremely long especially for a connection flight. Hundreds of staff but what a poor organisation. On top of that luggage was lost. Next time I'll do my best to avoid connecting at Heathrow.,2.0
623,Arrival at LHR Terminal 3 on 6 May 2014. Arrived at Terminal 3 on a Virgin Atlantic flight from San Francisco. Terminal 3 was clean and bright but still looks relatively outdated in parts compared to other facilities at Heathrow and other comparable large hub airports. Relatively short line for passport control. Clean toilets. Short wait for suitcase. Large presence of ground handling agents. Greater presence of customs agent than I had seen for a while which actually offers some reassurance. T3 arrivals landside (including certain retailers) has a very crowded and scruffy feel I do hope this will be the focus of forthcoming renovation and development work. Relatively long walk to Underground station but this is to be expected at an airport of this size and the trains are frequent from the T1/2/3 station.,8.0
624,I have used terminals 4 and 5 for flights in the past 3 months. Departure from both was pretty good with short queues for check-in and security though the scanners at Heathrow seem more sensitive than anywhere else I have been - everybody seems to set them off. Arriving is not so good with lengthy queues for passport checks as others have mentioned the scanners are painfully slow. Buses to and from long stay car parks seem to work well. My main gripe is that on both occasions having landed we were kept on the taxiway for 20-30 minutes as 'we are waiting for the gate to be vacated'. It also happened to my daughter (T5). It is frustrating that on a short flight you can spend as much time getting off the aircraft as you have in the air and on a long flight the last thing you want having arrived is to sit in your seat for another half hour. I know Heathrow is a large and very busy airport but this problem has to be addressed.,5.0
625,3 hours from landing to arriving home in Croydon - a distance of no more than 20 miles as the crow flies! Landed at terminal 5 after flying in from Chicago. Long wait for buses before we could get off the plane. Queues at passport control - how is it that the electronic machines for automatically reading passports take so long to work if they work so no one wants to use them? Once I'd collected baggage the real fun started. My options to get to Croydon are train Paddington then underground to Victoria and train to Croydon (complicated and train is expensive) underground to Victoria and train to Croydon (slow and engineering work meant no circle or district line services to Victoria) or bus direct from Heathrow to Croydon (1.5 hours but direct and cheap). How to get to central bus station? Signage in Terminal 5 is confusing and unhelpful. Man on info desk in Term 5 gave me incorrect info. Finally establish I need to get a train from Term 5 to Term 2/3 and train only runs every 15 minutes. Is this a 3rd world airport in the middle of the night? No its London Heathrow middle of day on Bank Holiday weekend. Why is there no free regular shuttle like the one between North and South Terminals in Gatwick? After an overnight flight the whole experience of landing at Term 5 was frustrating stressful and unpleasant. Lesson learned - wherever possible I'll avoid this airport in future. If you live in south London its a nightmare.,
626,Terminal 5. Minimal queues at passport control on arrival and bags waiting on the belt likewise at check-in and security on departure. Short walking distances from / to gates and short distance to the underground are bonuses. Staff are generally friendly courteous and efficient. Great views of the apron and the runways from the departure lounge which is relaxed light and airy with lots of seating. Lots of shops and restaurants too but we didn't visit any of them.,10.0
627,T1 outgoing 8th April returning 17th April LHR-VIE-TLV and return. Cons: the 'outer' gates are a full 15 minutes from the main area and the facilities in the outer reaches are quite lacking. Pros: the e-gates for returning UK/EEA nationals are now in place and save a lot of queuing time as a result. Security on the outgoing leg was fairly prompt. Overall: the new T2 can't come soon enough.,6.0
628,Make sure to look at your boarding passes to determine whether or not you have luggage to claim (I think if you are flying the same airline both flights your luggage goes to your destination). When I landed at Heathrow we were not given any directions or instructions about what we were to do next. Being an inexperienced traveler I assumed that I needed to pick up luggage so I followed the signs toward baggage claim. After standing in line for at least 10 minutes I realized that my baggage had already been sent to the next flight. The annoying thing was that nobody mentioned this to me. After baggage claim I must have made a wrong turn and got completely lost. The layout of the airport can be very confusing and there seems to be a lack of signage in some areas. I asked several employees for help and no one could put me in the right direction. Trying to find my way through this airport was like running through an endless maze. By the time I reached the boarding gate I had just missed my flight by about 5 mins. I went to the counter to have them put me on the next flight. Told it was my fault and had to charge me $275. The return trip was much easier because I knew that I didn't have to pick up luggage and I was with a group of people so that made it easier. As soon as we got off the plane there was an information display listing terminals according to the airlines so it was simply a matter of following signs to the terminal and departure gate. How did I miss this on my first trip? Where was the information display or clear signs in the baggage area? I guess I simply took the longer confusing route. I suppose some terminals may be smaller or easier to navigate then others. There are some nice restaurants and shops and the flights were pleasant but I will still try to avoid this airport in the future after this awful experience.,3.0
629,I really feel sorry for British Airways at T5 as they have an otherwise excellent terminal ruined by Security and Immigration which are out of their control. Having flown in on a BA flight from Geneva and departing to Manchester had to queue through the transit immigration desks rather than the electronic gates which took 20 minutes as only manned by 1 official despite there being 4 other channels! Then the joys of Heathrow security queuing for 15 minutes and then being told the equipment had broken and join the back of another queue for another 15 minute wait. I know security and immigration aren't the most interesting jobs around but some pretence at being human wouldn't go amiss as this is the first impression of the UK that most visitors get. Once inside the terminal is excellent!,7.0
630,I have to agree with previous comments for many years I used LHR from the ME en-route to Dublin. I found the Immigration a farce waiting for hours even though I was transiting through why I should have to clear immigration is beyond me. More security checks  again if I am a transit passenger why should I? I have already cleared security in my departure point. Last but not least from immigration to bitter rude and ignorant staff at security. I have never come across such unprofessional staff in any airport and fly monthly. Shameful for the entry point to the UK as it is great country with super people luckily Emirates now fly direct so no more LHR for me. A blessing.,2.0
631,Having read some of the reviews for Heathrow Airport one could be left thinking that the UK's hub airport is a third world disgrace. My experiences however are quite the opposite. I've flown from LHR a few times over the last couple of years and my last trip was to and from Terminal 5 in April 2014. The terminal building is light airy and clean. Everything is well sign-posted and there's a good choice of landslide coffee shops restaurants and pubs. Along with a pharmacy bureaux de change and other amenities. Although there are plenty of staff on hand I would say that the queuing system for check-in needs an overhaul. Despite being able to check-in at any desk one is left to queue at each desk individually; if a problem arises with a passenger in front then you are stuck waiting for that check-in agent whilst other passengers on surrounding desks move to the front. Despite some reviews I have always found the security process through to the departures lounge to be very quick and professional. On my latest trip I waited around 30 seconds. You can tell that the airport authority has invested a lot of money on the screening equipment used. I don't know whether some passengers aren't used to stringent security but I feel reassured and have never encountered a rude member of security staff. In fact I've found them to be both approachable and friendly. Terminal 5 is a giant shopping mall it has to be said - and an expensive one at that. But the fantastic panoramic views and beautiful sunlight coming through the expansive windows is enough to compensate for the commercialism. There's a good choice of bars and eateries. Unlike some other terminals at Heathrow you don't have to walk nearly as far to get to your gate but be warned - If you are travelling from gates marked 'B' or 'C' then you have to get an underground shuttle train to a satellite terminal and this can take 15 minutes. On arrival back to the UK I was through immigration in a couple of minutes and had my luggage a few minutes after that. Back in the arrivals hall and then onto the Heathrow Express - an (incredibly) expensive but convenient way to get from airport to city in less than half an hour.,9.0
632,"If you have respiratory ailments or allergies do not fly through or use London Heathrow! I have only mild allergies and had a two hour layover at London Heathrow. To and from my gate and from security check I was forced to walk past huge perfume displays with the scents wafting throughout the airport and terminal. I went to sit beside a ""fresh"" air vent only to discover there was perfume coming out of the vent! When I finally was called to my gate I had no choice but to walk through yet another gauntlet of perfume being sprayed around in a store that was open to the concourse. It ruined my trip and I will never use London Heathrow again. Customs was complete chaos. One agent would tell you to put everything back in your bag and the next agent would ask everyone to remove it again.",
633,"Had a transfer within Heathrow on 31 March 2014 which involved a security check from Terminal 5 into Terminal 3. The female security officer was officious and rude and the final straw was her comment ""if you don't like it don't fly"". What an appalling attitude. I usually fly from Manchester Airport where the security staff are friendly and extremely courteous and I hope never to have to use Heathrow again after this experience.",
634,T5 Immigration. I flew in from Cape Town on 28th March. The lines of people at immigration was a disgrace. We shuffled for ages in the EU passport line. It would have been faster not having an EU passport. Staff were slow and there seamed to be no urgency in clearing the hall that totally filled up. All the staff do is scan a passport not hard. The UK Govt should be ashamed of itself. You get though far quicker in third world nations where they do more than just scan your passport.,
635,I was very annoyed with the immigration controls this morning when arriving from Sydney via Singapore on a BA flight that arrived at 4.45 am. When we arrived at passport control there was not one single person to speak to. Many passengers were getting connecting flights and looked so confused. They were just left to read the electronic boards. Surely someone should have been on duty to help these passengers. Then as we approached the Passport control area several big flights had obviously come in at the same time but as we had electronic passports we thought we would be okay and would get through quickly. Wrong! UK and EU citizens were all herded into one area and it was not clear that the EPassport area was not available but we did finally see a small A4 sheet of paper which said that the epassport scanners were not operational until 5.30 am. It was 5.20 am so decided to stay in the long queue although some people started queuing for the epassport section. There were two female attendants to the right of this area and when I approached them to ask if I could go through with my epassport I was told quite sternly that I should join the large queue to my left. Then another official came on the scene and looked confused at the large queues and then proceeded to check the scanners and eventually invited people to use the escanners. However these did not appear to work properly because they were not giving any messages out. When one guy removed his passport because it didn't seem to be working the gates opened. This happened to a couple of people. Another member of staff joined the one guy on duty but they did not seem capable of helping people. I stood for ages with my passport in the scanner and eventually tried another one which eventually worked. My husband said that maybe the scanners need to warm up but surely the staff should know this and be on hand to help and advise. What an awful welcome for overseas visitors I was embarrassed because Terminal 5 is a super terminal but the staff need to be more helpful and welcoming to visitors. I flew through Sydney New Zealand Honk Kong and Singapore Airports and Heathrow was not up to the standard of these other airports which quite frankly is a disgrace and someone should be doing something about it.,5.0
636,Flew out of terminal 3 on Monday the food offering once checked in and through security is very poor. Unless you want sandwiches (which are offered in about 10 different shops) eat before you check in. Great train service to and from London is a huge thumbs up!,5.0
637,T5 Passport Control is an absolute disgrace. The queue for EU Passport holders today was horrendous. The passport staff look disinterested demotivated and miserable. What a terrible first impression overseas visitors must receive. The rest of the airport is great but how many people are avoiding using it because of this diabolical experience. Who is in charge of this mess? Replace them and rethink the strategy. There is no excuse in this modern world for such inefficiency particularly at the UK taxpayers expense.,
638,I have to say that reading past reviews about terminal 5 relates to the inconsistent performance where one day can be a fantastic experience and the next a forgetful. On outward leg (LHR-IAD) with British Airways bag drop was very quick although the check-in lady could do with a smile. I'm impressed with the structure of this terminal with its wide open walkways and high ceilings very reminiscent of the Asian Airports. It also has the sense of freshness something that all the other 4 terminals lack. Security was a bit slow and took an age considering the number of people in the queue. One thing I must say was after security it was very very busy. Quite surprising considering the vastness of the terminal! Perhaps it was because of the holiday season. Very good range of shops and restaurants/cafes etc and good to see that duty-free isn't a rip off! Next came the walk to our gate which was in the 'B' section of the terminal which meant using the light rail system. Very long escalator trip down to the bottom where the train was located. Must've taken a good 2 minutes without walking. Train was punctual and quick. Disappointing though that if you have a gate located in the 'B' or 'C' section you are cut away from the main terminal which contains the best of shops. Only shop in the B area was a whsmiths. Nevertheless I liked the effort Heathrow have made to move away from the '10km' walk to the gate so to speak. Plane left on time and was overall a pleasant experience. Inward journey was from EWR back to terminal 5. Disappointed that we were not given an air bridge to leave our British Airways plane; somewhat strange considering that this is their hub which means they should have the best facilities for their passengers. Bus took us to the main complex which was near passport control. We were wary of the times we've had to wait in the past so 25 minutes seemed standard. Bag carousel was big and 'airy' and bags were there ready to be picked up. Heathrow connect service to terminal 4 was okay; somewhat tedious since there is no direct service so an interchange is required. Bus to car park was punctual but a bit small. Overall an impressive turn around from the horrible days of cramped airports and long marathon walks to the gate. Hats off to BAA and BA.,8.0
639,"Unfortunately I travel through Heathrow frequently and often use flight connections at Terminal 5. It is unbelievable that a relatively new terminal would be such a disaster when one has to transfer from one flight to another. The queues just to get through to the queue for security are unbelievable full of people panicking they will miss their connection rude staff blocking the escalators up to security in an effort to ""control"" the crowds. Once you do get to security more of the same massive queues people trying to jump ahead of others in their effort to make a connection total chaos. I cannot imagine how you survive the experience is you are elderly or infirm.",1.0
640,I am echoing many of the comments of my fellow reviewers by saying that I will avoid LHR in future because it has become the worst transit airport I have experienced in 50 years of international travel. The staff are poorly trained. Terminal 5 is very unfriendly to the disabled - we were separated from our 89 year old family member at several points after waiting long periods for assistance. We asked how long we would have to wait in the wheelchair holding area and even the supervisor said anything from 5 minutes to 5 hours. The British philosophy of security seems to be to zero in on easy targets no common sense is applied such as spending 20 minutes on a 90 year old wheelchair passenger. Lastly having to ride a train several times as well as go through security again and then sit around waiting for a gate number which might mean yet another train ride is just about the worst scenario you can devise for people who have to ride in cramped poorly air conditioned planes for perhaps 12 hours to get to Heathrow and then have to do the same to their next destination. Going through Madrid now seems like heaven.,3.0
641,Arrived terminal 4 on 25 Feb 2014. Had organised a wheelchair as I have breathing problems but it didn't turn up. I struggled along to stand in Passport Control for an hour or more. The queues were horrendous. I got through eventually and got to baggage reclaim to find out like hundreds of other people did that there were no trolleys. I tried to get help but there was none and they did not know when the trolleys would be collected from the car parks. I am 70 years old and had to struggle trying to pull 2 small suitcases and my hand luggage. I will never fly from Heathrow again. Quite honestly it has the worst Airport service I have ever had and I have been in many over the years.,
642,Security check is a disaster. Led over terminal for miles waiting in queues for long times staff rude. Everybody annoyed felt very sorry for elderly people. Cannot imagine them to catch anything but bottles of water and lighters.,
643,"I had the misfortune to use Terminal 5 again at LHR two weeks ago - domestic flight. The Security Staff are horrendous they are extremely rude off-hand and downright unpleasant! I am a middle-aged professional respectable female and I find these people completely odious in their attitude. Yes of course they have a job to do but why does that involve a total lack of courtesy and aggressiveness! Unfortunately I have to use LHR on a regular basis and have now trained myself to simply ""zone-out"" and not give them the satisfaction of reacting to their behaviour!",
644,Terminal 1. No comparison to other terminals - signage is strange and people are very rude. There is a physical sign that states gates 77-80 I asked where gate 76 was and rudely told - around the corner by three people. When I said there is no sign for anything lower than gate 77 I received a who cares stare. I don't utilize terminal 1 99% of the time it is terminal 3. All passengers around me had the same challenges and thought it was interesting that there were no signs for gate 76 until you actually reach it. Also when I was connecting from T3 I was told different answers to transfer and obtain a boarding pass for BA LHR-DUB.,1.0
645,I arrived from AMS BA429 yesterday we landed at 10.40am on time within 20 mins I was through immigration and had my baggage in my hand off of the baggage belt it is not often this happens but when it works it makes a great difference to getting home without having to wait sometimes 45 minutes for luggage so well done! I always use the Pod Parking too which makes for a fast exit from the airport too I have heard that BAA are looking to extend the Pod Parking to the long term parking further on down the road this will be great if they do as it will mean no more waiting for buses which run around 15 minutes part.,10.0
646,"If BA offers you a tight connection Heathrow will always be an awfully stressful experience. Keep in mind you will always land late because unless you arrive before 6am you will first circle London 2-3 times. Staff are overall very rude. Every aspect of your journey is handled by a different company. I travel with a disabled family member. If you begin your journey at Heathrow disability assistance drives you to a series of checkpoints where typically you will sit unable to leave with a supervisor who hardly speaks any English. Even if you start out 3-4 hours before your flight you might have no opportunity to shop or get some food. If you have a transfer through Heathrow disability assistance insists on driving you to a checkpoint near passport control where you will be stuck for some time while the assistance staff socialises with one another and inefficiently makes its future plans. Last time we flew through Heathrow was 9-10 months ago. We had a tight connection made still tighter by the aforementioned Heathrow slow flush cycle. Disability assistance came late then sat there for 10 minutes then drove to the checkpoint and sat for 15 minutes doing nothing. Luckily a BA tight connections assistant came by and checked out tickets for the connection we were already late to board so that it would not leave without us. She also gave us orange ""short connection"" passes and asked the disability assistance to hurry up but neither was to any avail. Then we walked the remaining distance to the gate which took another 10 minutes. We were met by about ten BA employees at the gate who were horrified at how long it took for us to be escorted through the airport on a tight connection. Learn my lesson - don't transfer through Heathrow unless you really have to but certainly never do it on a tight connection.",2.0
647,Arrived by Heathrow Express not having used the airport for a good many years. No problems throughout transit to flight departure. On return I was on the Heathrow Express and London bound within an hour off stepping off the plane.,7.0
648,Flew into T5. On transfer to domestic flight we found directions confusing. On queuing for security the whole queue of approx 12 people were told off for lining up in the express line which actually was the only one open. We dutifully moved over to the correct line which she then opened for us. No word of apology or explanation. We found the staff to be rude and officious. After a 13 hour flight and after the positive experiences of 3 airports in Australia Singapore Christchurch Bangkok and Chiang Mai it was dispiriting and embarrassing. Why can't we get basic courtesy right? First impressions count.,4.0

650,The airport is fine. But getting in was a nightmare for me. I wanted to park in short stay terminal three. Utterly confused by approach signs and ended up in terminal one car park. Couldn't of course get out to park in terminal 3 and had to walk a long way - not easy for one like me waiting for a hip replacement. Can't you make the signs to the various terminals clearer. There is so much traffic on the approach most of which seems to be familiar with the layout of the approach. Big clear signs indicating various short stay car parks needed.,6.0

652,Always find arriving and departing Heathrow airport an awful experience. Endless walking down endless corridors rude staff and everywhere an information free zone. London is supposed to be international and global show piece Heathrow let's it down every time.,2.0
653,Flew out 21st Dec return 5th Jan from Delhi from T4. Had a surprisingly good experience after last debacle from T3. Arrived early to find airport busy but spent an hour in hidden away pub next to airport pod hotel. Check in and security took 30 minutes and OK selection of shops airside - duty free expensive as per the norm for the UK. Flight returning 1 hour late 15 minutes in holding pattern. Immigration queue non-existent (2 minutes for e- gates) and bags arrived within 10 minutes. Pleasant experience compared to previous visits to T3 and T4 2 years previously especially given flying on some of busiest days of the year.,8.0
654,Terminal 1. Flying out to Lisbon with TAP. Departure lounge okay - missing cheap coffee shop after security (EAT. is my preferred airport UK coffee) but good seats for relaxing on. My main gripe with this airport is my flight was 6am and I was coming from Kent so got a late-night lift and tried to sleep in the airport. Other than this there's nothing to remark on about this terminal I feel. There are no overnight departures (mine was one of the first in the morning).,5.0
655,Flew out of Heathrow to Sao Paulo. Never understand the negative reviews of Heathrow especially from US passengers who have to endure Miami LA JFK etc. Terminal 1 was clean not over-crowded efficient with virtually no queues. And of course where Heathrow beats other airports hands down is the shopping and eating facilities. My only complaint is it would be nice to have some affordable shops. Shopping at Heathrow and other airports is more expensive than the high street not less.,8.0
656,Disappointing experience as I was traveling through Heathrow from Paris to DC during Christmas. I agree with other reviews here that T5 is simply bursting at the seams since it's handling almost half of Heathrow's traffic. Flight connections center particularly on the outbound journey took nearly an hour to clear as there was a huge bottleneck at security. They do make an effort to help people with tight connections with express passes but they need to improve the wait times at security. Airside T5 is still very good.,6.0
657,I have to disagree with all the praise of T5. It is already overcrowded beyond capacity for much of the day and it is often hard to find a seat. In spring summer and fall the temperature is too warm and humid for comfort given all the people inside the terminal. There are no pay lounges no lounges for Star Alliance or SkyTeam carriers (or any other carriers for that matter) and BA does not offer paid access to its lounges so if you do not have BA/Oneworld status you have no lounge access at all. This is not true in T1 T3 and T4. There are no pay showers either (unlike T1 T3 and T4)--so if you do not have lounge access a shower is not an option. The toilet facilities are also inadequate - it is not uncommon to be unable to get a stall without a long wait something that never happens in Frankfurt Munich Vienna or most other European airports. There all also very long lines at most transit desks with no automated boarding pass printers like those in German airports. Overall a very unpleasant experience if you cannot access a lounge. I much much prefer T1/T2/T4.,5.0
658,Terminal 3. Arrived from NRT. Long wait at UK Border control (I'm a UK passport holder - two desks out of 7 open). Luggage waiting when I finally got through immigration. Long walk from arrival gate (Gate 1). Everything else ok.,5.0
659,Terminal 1. A surprise and a delight. Quite airy bright and efficient for our flight to FRA. Everything smooth and quick.,10.0
660,"I will do absolutely everything in my power to avoid flying into Heathrow in the future. They unfortunately are the passengers first taste of London and it leaves an unsavory taste for the entire country. The security is extremely rude and unprofessional. There is a lack of communication and there is a lack of respect for a person's time and flight. Do not rely on signage or website for explanation of rules. We found the rules to change from person to person. No one had a clear answer. When we finally arrived outside of the airport everyone we spoke with had the same to say about Heathrow ""avoid using them"". Regardless of price convenience (no such thing at Heathrow) try a different route. Heathrow Security was our main issue but the restaurants and staff in other areas were just as surly. I would like to think it was because of the holidays but I would have assumed kindness and respect anytime of the year. Not a good way to start our vacation.",
661,I must concur in Richard Hughes' sentiments (posted in this forum 11th December) - Heathrow Terminal 5 is quite good to use. Most recently I arrived from IAD on 27th November and returned 17th December on arrival passport control queues were very short (admittedly arriving on BA216 one of T5's earliest arrivals helps - will be interesting to check out next year when they deploy the A380 on this flight) and on departure (scheduled for 17.00) I only had to wait behind two people for bag drop and the security queue took about 5min. Once airside there were plenty of seats notably at the Crown Rivers pub which has expanded its seating and provides a perfect place to nurse a pint or two whilst waiting for one's departure gate to be posted and the Scotch whisky selection at the various duty free shops is as good as it's ever been. (The rule on no bag drop more than 3 hours prior to scheduled departure helps ease potential airside crowding as well.) I haven't been to any of the celebrated airports of the Far East as yet but of the airports I've been to Heathrow Terminal 5 is about as good as it gets.,10.0
662,"Unfortunate enough to have a connecting flight via Heathrow Terminal 5 and are traveling with duty-free alcohol that you purchased legally with your boarding pass? Especially coming from Seoul or another metropolis which isn't on the ""list"" of allowed duty-free items which is not clearly posted anywhere and do not 1) have enough time between connecting flights for it to be checked should security even offer you that option or 2) not miraculously have an extra bag you can use to check it in with since your in transit or both of the above well be prepared to have Heathrow security take it away from you for no good reason. Never again!",
663,LHR T5 - DXB - LHR T5. Not quite sure what previous reporters find to complain about Heathrow particularly Terminal 5 which is always in my experience pretty good to use. Try flying into or out of any North American International Airport (particularly Newark Chicago O'Hare or Las Vegas) and you'll see just how good British Airports are. Alright not quite Changi in Singapore but pretty good. Going out 27 November no queues at BA Bag Drop and although a queue at Security it kept on moving. Let's be honest - queues at Security and Passport Control are standard just about everywhere nowadays. Once through and out of the retail mall that most airports now are we found plenty of seats tucked away in quiet corners. Coming back in on 8 December bit of a queue at Passport control and for once a 30 minute wait for baggage. Apart from that a breeze.,8.0
664,I was flying from Tokyo to Berlin via Heathrow end of last year. The security check took so long allowing sea of people waiting on the line while only a few of grumpy staffs were working there were other staffs joking around without helping the others. They checked almost every little thing even screened my macbook air's adapter and didn't bother to let the elderly sit down first after a long haul flight. It's too bad that some respectable airlines to Japan fly via LHR otherwise I would avoid this airport.,3.0
665,We had a very bad experience with the security checks and the staff performing it. Flying from Brussels on October 29th we had 1.5 hours to catch a connecting flight to Singapore. Because this means you have to go to from terminal 1 to 3 by bus (this service was good) there is not much time to loose. We could go in a fast lane for the security check of our hand luggage. Our bags were put aside for further checks. One lady was performing the checks. There were 3 people before us whose luggage was put aside. The result was one staff member performing her duty incredibly slowly. I stayed at the security checkpoint waiting for our bags to be checked in the meanwhile my partner went to the airline desk to explain what was happening. After 20 minutes waiting (in that time the luggage of 3 persons was checked) finally our bags were checked. Of course nothing was wrong with our bags. We had to run to catch our flight we were the last passengers to board. This was an extremely stressful experience and all due to the misuse of power by the security staff. Very unprofessional! In the future we will avoid London Heathrow when booking flights! Reading some of the other reviews with bad experiences like ours it seems that the airport management does not care to improve things. For the record: we are experienced travellers and we had never encountered misbehaviour of security staff before.,2.0
666,Terminal 5 security and hand luggage screening. Staff and organisation is deplorable both in their work ethic and attitude to travellers. Would avoid Heathrow if at all possible and use other routes.,
667,T5. As usual swift check in ruined by badly organised and slow security. Many staff are not actually doing anything because it is so badly laid out. It needs a rethink. Coming back bags through in 15 minutes but the tube station was an information free zone. The terminal could be great if this snags were sorted out.,5.0
668,Returning from holiday to Terminal 4 after an 8 hour flight was not made any easier by the interminable wait for our baggage. It must have taken an hour before it started coming through - and that was after we'd walked all the way there. Is this a ruse to make money in the car parks from the people waiting to pick people up?,3.0
669,Terminal 1 - both arrival and departure on United Airlines from/to SFO. There's a lot of construction going on here at this airport. It can be seen everywhere so cosmetically not an eye appealing airport. Only complaints really was the mile plus walk to and from the aircraft extremely long lines through immigration a rather rude and obnoxious immigration officer who commented 'oh another one!' when I said I was there to attend a wedding and unusual and extensive questioning of my 19 year old son. Duty free and departure areas nice and open plenty of food and shops everywhere. Be prepared for long walks. One commonality with this airport every-time landing delays and take off queues. One of the worst.,4.0
670,Yet again Heathrow fails on the basics that it is supposed to provide. With the flight arriving on time again a delay due to the inability of staff to get stairs to the plane. Add this to the queues at immigration not helped by the automatic e-passport scanners not working this then sums up Heathrow at the moment. For an airport trying to get fees to go up again way above inflation they should maybe try and get the basic services right before trying to grab yet more money from customers.,2.0
671,Had to go through London Heathrow twice on my way to and from Romania. The first time was an absolute nightmare. I ended up missing my flight even though I had a 2 hour connection time. It was mostly my fault because I made the mistake of not knowing that my luggage was transferred to the next flight so I went through baggage claim instead of heading straight to my terminal. I had no idea how huge and confusing this airport would be. The distances are long and require lots and lots of walking. Staff are very unhelpful if you ask for directions or assistance. The way back was much easier because I knew not to pick up my luggage and I was with a group of people. The signs seemed much more clear and easy to follow but on the way there I noticed there are some areas that have very few signs so it's easy to get lost and confused. Facilities are clean and up to date and restaurants are nice but the overall efficiency and customer service are low.,3.0
672,Flying in and out of LHR using T1 T4 and T5. Although the immigration queue (arrival) and security queue (departure) are long the officers are doing their job. No time wasting no chit-chat and acceptable. Ambience of all the terminals are nice clean and user-friendly. Staff are firm when they need to be yet courteous and helpful. Used LHR several times and the improvement over the years are apparent.,9.0
673,I was dreading going through Heathrow at 9.00 in the morning but Immigration and baggage claim were all very quick. It was a welcome surprise.,8.0
674,Not the first occasion I have arrived at T5 to see the queues for EU passport holders stretching back whilst that for servicing non EU passport holders is almost non existent have in past seen non EU passport staff sitting idle chatting whilst queues for EU passport holders is very long. The managers within this area need to balance those queues effectively it is not rocket science and please sort the technology for the biometric passport readers. I have worn glasses for the past 51 years every time I use those machines I get different advice leave them on take them off in taking them off what is it to be. Bags arrived in about 20 mins which given the scale of he operation is I believe acceptable. So in short the border teams need to manage their workflow much better an easy task to address not sure they have the appetite: the baggage handlers are doing good job.,5.0
675,My husband I and recently flew from Terminal 3 to go on holiday. We travelled to the airport by train and within 20 minutes of arriving at the train station we had checked 2 bags and gone through security. We were very impressed with the new security procedures. All staff we dealt with were efficient but courteous. The shopping area was pleasant and we didn't have trouble finding somewhere to sit. We would prefer to see a cheap fast food restaurant but overall found the whole experience easy and pleasant.,10.0
676,The first excuse they have the management close the airport to flights. Monday 28th October I watched flights arrive and take off at the time wind speed reached its peak at 69mph around 8.00am. All flights before then i.e. would have arrived/departed at lower wind speeds were cancelled. I had to stay an extra night in the Heathrow Sheraton paid for a car in Nice I could not drive and paid for a room in Monte Carlo in which I could not sleep. The management in Heathrow should think of their customers before they give their staff a lie in bed on a Monday morning. Pathetic. I urge everybody to avoid this airport if they can. Previous similar experience was 6 inch snow in Paris but CDG open - less than half inch snow in Heathrow but closed. As I said any excuse for a rest for the workers. Pathetic.,
677,"We travelled almost thirty hours from Darwin to Singapore then Singapore to Heathrow. We had an excellent experience in Changi Airport and the whole customer service was amazing. We arrived one hour late at Heathrow and had to transfer from Terminal 3 to Terminal 5. The bus driver scowled and did not even acknowledge a ""Good Morning"" after getting through customs who were polite we had a little over one hour to find our Gate for transfer to Newcastle. On getting to security we went through No 11 and the young woman had a Chant on what we needed to do I asked her to say please and was ignored we waited for our hand luggage to go through the scanners and when our small case did not come through we were told that this needed to go into a grey tray so we went back through the metal detector and the same young woman said to my husband ""You here"" and proceeded to berate us for not putting our case in the grey tray. I could not believe we were being spoken to in this manner bearing in mind that we had travelled for thirty hours were very tired and had one hour to find our gate. I would avoid Heathrow if possible when travelling as I felt that travellers were treated with contempt and scorn by people who should not have any authority.",
678,Flew out and back to LHR terminal one generally I found the terminal facilities good with plenty of shops bars and restaurants my one major problem was on the return and the long walk from the plane to baggage reclaim must have been a good 30 mins walk down endless corridors and have found this after returning on long haul flights the airport authority need to improve this or provide more moving walkways.,7.0
679,My partner and myself flew with BA 831 on 21 Oct and had a connection flight to Malta with KM 101 departing at 10:50. Upon arriving at security at Heathrow terminal 4 at 10.00 before catching our connection flight the female supervisor at the time immediately told us and two other persons (who still needed to get our boarding passes printed at the airline desk behind security) that the flight was closed (a good 50 mins before departure time and notwithstanding the fact that there were numerous passengers still queuing at security for this same flight). She told us that we needed to go back to Terminal 1 and file a complaint with BA (who despite not having the real blame treated us very well). Unfortunately after all this terribly inconvenient incident without any logical sense or any sensibility from this Heathrow employee we ended up having to detour to Paris then Malta where we finally arrived at 20.00 instead of the planned 15.00. To top it all up our luggage (including the other detoured passengers) were did not arrive with us in Malta and were left at Heathrow. Unfortunately the insensibility of such an employee will cost the airport at least 4 families not choosing Heathrow Airport for their next travelling bookings.,
680,Terminal 3 is a disgrace. Long delays for security with staff offering no support or assistance. It is an embarrassment for the international airport to be allowed to operate in this way. Never again. Take my advice and use Gatwick or British Airways' Terminal 5. The British Airports Authority are a disgrace to allow this to happen. The start of our holiday has been a shambles with no apology.,
681,Flew LHR to Johannesburg. Terminal was clean functional and orderly and queues were reasonably short. Facilities excellent in terminal 1 as wit the other terminals. I can't understand the people who moan on here especially the US citizens who have to endure US airports such as JFK and LAX. Heathrow is a breeze by comparison.,8.0
682,Connected T5 to T1. Waited 10 minutes for a bus followed by a 10 minute journey to T1. This terminal is a maze of escalators ramps narrow corridors and long walks. The security queue was quite short but still waited 15 minutes to get through. 2 of the 5 lanes were closed. As on previous occasions at T1 I found the security staff to be officious slow and apparently unconcerned about people missing their flights. There was no fast track lane or help for those with tight connections. Several bags appeared to have been kept for hand inspection despite the fact all of us were transit passengers who had been through a security check once already. After security there was a long walk through a shopping mall to reach the gate which had very limited seating.,4.0
683,I flew in this morning from Canada. I had an arrivals lounge invitation for a shower and breakfast. Unfortunately I couldn't find the lounge so I went to the information desk. At the desk instead of being helped the person behind the desk was rude! I couldn't believe it! Eventually I did find the lounge.,
684,Shops and restaurants are good usual lack of seating space. Friendly (in airport-relative terms) staff. No excessive waiting anywhere. (Terminal 3.) Plenty of toilets and clean. Showers for eight pounds.,7.0
685,Sep 24th - Flight from Dublin was to land at 1.05pm at T1 - but it was late and landed at 3.20pm - I was connecting to BA's Inaugural A380 flight to LAX leaving from a C Gate at T5 at 4.15pm. After leaving the plane in T1 I got a bus to T1 then another bus to T5 then through Security then the transit train to C Gate - that took 1 hour 25 minutes and I barely make the flight to LAX. Lack of signage is a major problem - also the number of personnel at Security - not enough to deal with the volume of passengers. The flight itself was wonderful - but signage and more well uniformed and informed people on the ground were very lacking.,4.0
686,Terminal 5. Never use this terminal if you have less than 3 hours between 2 flights even arriving and departing from this same terminal. Being forced to have a security check between 2 connecting flights is unacceptable.,1.0
687,"6.10am on Sunday 1 September. Handed a 'priority lane' card by the attendants on our flight. Waiting in the two allotted lanes business class passengers soon realised they were being processed much more slowly than the economy lanes. One reason was there were only two staff: the other was a female Border Agency officer seemed determined to hold everyone up as long as possible. After a third-degree interrogation - at the age of 67 (as shown in my Australian passport) - I think I had 90% convinced her that no I did not intend to work in the UK. To make sure I said: ""Look if you really want I will show you my UK passport but I wanted to enter and leave as an Aussie"". Grudgingly she stamped my Australian passport. Welcome to Britain. No matter how much money the English Tourist Board spends on promotion it's the initial impression that counts. The UK Border Agency needs to lift its game. The overall impression is: ""I am a junior public servant but I have the power to make your life miserable and I will if I can."" Pathetic.",
688,Flew in to Sydney this morning from LHR T3 (via Dubai on QF2) - if you expect to get a VAT refund for cash: forget it unless you are prepared to wait for hours. I was there 2.5 hours before my flight: more than enough anywhere else in the civilised world: the queue was at least 100 people and not moving. There were 2 gentlemen at a small table to the right of the VAT queues who were apparently dealing with VAT refunds for credit cards and only about six people waiting. Anyway they took my receipts and stamped them and said they'd post them for me. The level of disorganisation was dispiriting to say the least and then the queue for security: 45 minutes or more. Thank goodness I had checked in online earlier in the day and the baggage drop (Qantas business class) was quick and pleasant.,2.0
689,Had to spend night in T3 for an early flight that's ok but did expect to maybe find somewhere open for a meal but everything was shut by 10.30pm so managed to grab a sandwich from one shop before they closed. About 35 people spending the night but nowhere you can put your head down for a few hours kip as the seats are conveniently designed with armrests making it almost impossible to stretch out unless you are a contortionist! Several passengers resorted to the floor I'm in my fifties and was pretty uncomfortable and there were folks older than me ok could have got a hotel but working on a tight budget. That said the queuing time was ok having self checked in just had to go to the bag drop but please can we have at least a coffee shop open and some seats without armrests?,8.0
690,"I am not sure if the difficulty is that travel agent did not allow enough time for transfer but we were very rushed with 1 hour 50 minutes. I know in some airports in the USA if booking myself I would have added more time. Going from US to Scotland we had to transit to terminal 5 and go through security once again. We were given an orange ""FAST TRACK"" sign which then seemed to have no effect afterwards but certainly is an indication that the time we were allowed was not enough. There is a lack of people giving direction and I am not sure still why we had to have our picture taken. We did make our flight partially thanks to a group of 20 travelling together who were later making the plane than we were. On the way back our plane from Edinburgh couldn't take off on time because of fog at Heathrow so we were changed to another international flight which gave us plenty of time at Heathrow. We didn't have to leave T5 but our departure gate was not posted until quite late. Someone could at least have told us that we were flying the (inaugural flight) of the airbus to LA and that it can only take off from C gates we could have moved there earlier. When they posted the boarding the board said ""now loading passengers"" but didn't say what rows they were boarding and we couldn't hear the announcements and got sent back a couple of times because we thought they had announced our row and they hadn't. A couple of ground people at the head of the line would have helped or posting the row on the board. There is a lack of helpful people in the airport. At DFW (Dallas/Fort Worth) they have volunteers to help. Allowing only 45 minutes of free wireless time is ridiculous. Even Edinburgh allows an hour of free time. Also the wireless connection was difficult to get depending on our location in the airport.",4.0
691,"If you are a disabled traveller requiring pre-booked wheelchair transfers be prepared for lack of service lack of care and downright rudeness - I nearly flew back to Scotland again after waiting 1 hr on my inbound plane for a wheelchair - the aircrew - even the captain appealed for help on the radio but were brushed off. When assistance staff arrived he refused to speak to me talking only to the aircrew and referring to me as ""she"" - he put me on the bus to T3 with my luggage and had a furious row with the bus driver who told me I should have been accompanied - the driver and another passenger kindly helped me to the assistance desk at the other end (not his job at all). At T3 no wheelchair available and now my flight to Bangkok was closing in 10 mins - the staff member I found did not care at all and was more interested in surfing the web on his phone. I had to lose my rag with him to get some action and finally made it after 2hrs 10 mins - the only reason I got there was my flight was delayed by 20 mins. In contrast Bangkok was efficient and courteous as were Sydney Cairns Brisbane Perth Jo'burg and Capetown and Glasgow - come on Heathrow call that service! It was an appalling experience that spoilt the start of my holiday of a lifetime. Gatwick for me in future - I recommend if you can fly through Gatwick do I've never had any such problems there!",
692,We have used Heathrow for the last 2 years touching 3 and can say that it is such a stress free experience. First time we flew from here was with British Airways in 2011 to San Francisco. Second time was last October when we flew Virgin Atlantic to JFK New York. We arrived at ten am for our 2pm flight and even though we were an hour early for check in Virgin took our bags and issued boarding passes. We made it though security in ten minutes and then left on time. Our third time we flew we again flew Virgin Atlantic to JFK New York. This time everything went to plan and we took off 15 minutes early at 9.15am instead of 9.30 arriving in JFK twenty minutes early. The only down side to Heathrow is the lack of staff at border control on re-entry which took us twenty minutes to clear!,9.0
693,T5. Big fan of this terminal. However bit of a slip up on my last arrival. Bags were to arrive on Belt 7 which as a Club Europe passenger mine did before the others. All the others arrived on Belt 6 with no notification. I would have expected this in the early days of T5 but not now.,9.0
694,Nearly missed my connection due to the queues at security even though the flight I arrived on landed early. The distance you have to travel to get to your next boarding gate is too long and the layout is confusing. The staff don't go out of their way to help and appear a bit jaded which is understandable considering they are having to constantly deal with so many disgruntled people. I realise we need strict security checks but the volume of passengers passing through this airport clearly can not be processed in a structured and timely manner. A few passengers had their luggage removed from the aircraft as they didn't make it even though the boarding time was extended which caused the flight to be delayed. I will purposely avoid this airport in future if an alternative is available even if it means extra cost.,
695,Security treats you like a criminal - received a full body pat down and they require liquids separated bags scanned etc. even if you've just gone through the same process only hours earlier in order to get onto the British Airways flight that brought you there. Crowds are enormous and the process is slow. Distances are ridiculously vast - even within the same terminal I had to walk (make that 'run' to make my connection) for what felt like miles and then take a shuttle to get to the gate. The entire process is a nightmarish exercise in endurance and as a result I have vowed to myself to never put myself into this airport or through this ordeal again. The last bit is kind of a shame as the flight itself - even in coach was actually reasonably pleasant. But all in all simply not worth the misery.,1.0
696,T3. Fast tracked both ways so no queuing times for Upper Class. Own lines for immigration on arrival and security lines for departure. Only one small incident on departure my 5 year old child triggered the manometer because he was wearing regular kid shoes. First time that happened to him and he travels 2x yearly. Adult sneakers were okay. He got a pat down while the adults were through without any issue. Place crowded long lines at VAT refund. I spent my time in the lounge.,7.0
697,"I had a great time at this airport mainly because I had an upper class virgin ticket. Got shorter queues and hanging out in the ""clubhouse"" was the best. It was almost worth the cost of the ticket!",10.0
698,T5. Tale of two stories. On departure the security line took too long for family of three. We were directed to a line where there were no one there. Waited like 10-15 minutes before someone came over to assist with luggage x-rays etc. T5 layout is like the new airports requiring a shuttle train to take you to the other terminals (B/C). That means going down long escalators as transport is underground. Kids playground closed too early at 6pm for the night flights. On arrival everything was a breeze. No wait at immigration or baggage landed at 5 am. Restaurants and restrooms okay. Gift shops reasonable.,7.0
699,I have used Terminal 5 a number of times over the last year. On each occasion queues at bag drop and security have been short. Airside the terminal is impressive. There is a comprehensive selection of shops and restaurants. The terminal is well signed and it is easy to take the short shuttle train to Satellites B and C if your flight departs from there (which most long haul flights do). The BA lounge is also spacious and comfortable. On arrival I have not experienced any queues at immigration and baggage generally arrives quickly. Flying as it should be.,10.0
700,"Departure on 15 August 2013 with CX250. A true nightmare with horror starting from VAT refund service queuing time 60 min+ and getting wheelchair service was like being in a third world country begging for help and customs and/or security check staffs (all 5 of them I dealt with) are with passenger-I-don't-care attitude. Almost everyone reminded us of the 3-hours-rule for the airport. Trust me you need 5 hours for London Heathrow terminal 3 sort of ""better safe than sorry"" thing. But if you do you will lose one whole day of your holiday just because you are leaving through ""London Heathrow terminal 3"".",
701,Transferred through Terminal 5 two times this summer (have also transferred through it for the past few years) and I am really tired of the shopping mall set up - the toilets are hidden behind narrow corridors between shops that I cannot afford the stench of perfume from the shops is so overpowering that it burns one's nose and you have to pay for wi-fi. Also during my transfer in July the a/c was not working properly and the airport was way too hot. I sincerely hope that this terminal concept does not become a model that is emulated by others.,4.0
702,I travel a lot and have been through many airports and this by far was the worst most inefficient airport I have stepped foot in. Terminal 3 had a 30 min wait just to get into the security gates. Then another 20 mins to get through to the scanner. Many bags were being lined up for a hand inspection with only one person checking them. Most bags had nothing in them to be removed. I was in a crowd of people waiting for my bag for 25 mins! While one lady slowly checked one thing at a time. Laughing and talking to her colleagues. There was no urgency despite the fact that I said my flight was boarding in 10 mins. I was bomb checked twice because they had nothing better to do. My bag was in a line of about 12-15 bags just sitting there while I waited. 7 people had to have suitcases offloaded from our flight too which delayed us. I'm sure this was because they were still stuck at that ridiculous security in the airport. I understand they security is for our safety but they were slow unhelpful and I have never been more frustrated in an airport. Will avoid flying there in the future.,
703,Terminal 5. This morning my bag was taken for an extra search and I was kept waiting for over 20 mins. My complaint is two fold: Firstly I was picked up for a minute bottle of perfume in my bag that has been there for multiple flights. Airport security should be consistent in its findings. Secondly was the total lack of urgency of the staff. Hard to believe they were looking after travellers with deadlines as they strolled around without a care in the world with that pompous air of power they held over you. It was the worst experience of poor customer service I have ever experienced. As I mentioned it took over 20 mins to look into 3 people's trays that just shows you how lazy the staff were.,
704,Do avoid this airport at all costs expect delays and queues from the moment you get near the airport. First we had to wait for a landing slot so queued in the air circling for 20 mins. Then when we did land it took 40 mins of queues to pass through passport control. Then a queue of 30 mins to collect baggage and no trolleys. Then when we made it through the airports the m25 motorway was jammed. Not a good airport. Too busy too cramped too many delays and queues. It's dated compared to modern airports - avoid.,
705,Used T1 this summer. Long queues at passport control and extremely long distances to walk even with the conveyors but all that was nominal compared with the horrendous experience leaving from T1. The idiocy with the liquid strictness is terrible. At least put up signs so we could put things in our suitcases before they were checked in and not have valuable drinks creams etc even water thrown away. Seems they want the stores there to make money. But worst of all was the security scanning. They were abrupt and rude. inefficient and chatted with each other instead of giving service. My bag was re hauled and pulled apart after having waited 20 min all because of an empty bottle. It astounds me that a scanner cannot see if there is liquid or maybe they are down right incompetent.,2.0
706,No problem either going out or coming back into T5. Security was a breeze and staff friendly and co-operative. Returning into T5 there were no queues at immigration and luggage came out within 10 minutes. I may have been lucky though but no complaints at all.,9.0
707,Departure from T4 went smoothly with no delays at security screening. Shops and food outlets tend towards the high end and expensive but I did get a very good deal on a camera for my holiday. Had a coffee and a snack in Pret a Manger - plenty of seating available and prices seemed comparable with the high street. However there could be a better range of food outlets.,7.0
708,Arrival at T5 is quick and painless. Bit of walk a to immigration through in seconds today (5am arrival) bags out in about 20. Good coffee places etc outside. They do charge for people dropping off and picking up in cars though!,10.0
709,"Check-in at T5 was easy. Security was another matter. Almost all of the lanes in the south security area were closed. An airport employee refused to let me use the Fast Track although I was eligible as it was ""very busy"". I was sent to the north security area where there is no Fast Track. It was absolutely packed. I asked one of the staff why it was so busy and just got a shrug of the shoulders. The person on the security scanner was taking an age to check the bags as he was asking a colleague about almost every bag. The system seems to have a weak spot as two bag check lines feed into one body scanner so if a person sets off the alarm which happened frequently everyone of the same gender has to wait until that person is frisked. The rest of the airside area was extremely busy with a lot of floor space taken up with designer label shops. Fortunately I had access to an airline lounge although even that was short of seats. I shudder to think what this place would be like if a lot of flights are delayed.",3.0
710,Shameful is the only word to describe the experience of security at terminal 3 on 1st July. The staff who were in control at the fast track that morning had a serious attitude problem and would make a guess some were working to rule. If not so whoever trains manages supervises and is responsible for them is operating a total basket case. The worst experience in a long time and a promise to myself I will never ever transit through this airport again. The whole episode was in contrast to an arrival today in Hong Kong were young men and women doing the same job not only gave a professional service but looked the part as well. Shame on whoever is responsible for such a shambolic mess.,1.0
711,I had to travel through London Heathrow on May 24th when they had the fire on another BA flight and the whole experience was not only chaotic but extremely frustrating. I will never travel through this airport ever again. Not only did we not get any instructions from staff when we landed as to what we were to do next with lines in the thousands but the airport is not disability friendly at all. I ended up having to stand at that airport in line to rebook my flight for over 8+ hours. When getting off of the plane we had to get off on stairs because the ramps were not available then when you actually get inside the airport (Terminal 5) there are escalators and you could hardly find an elevator anywhere. It wasn't just the fact that we missed our connecting flight that made the experience so bad but the fact that there was such little communication about what we were expected to do next after that and the fact that there was not anywhere to sit down nor enough elevators or moving ramps etc. As far as I'm concerned they need to revamp this Terminal even further to make it more disability friendly and train their staff better to handle delays and emergencies and provide more assistance to travelers who may need a little extra help.,
712,"Used this airport to transfer a number of times this year so far. In short as a transfer passenger I will be avoiding it at all costs. Deplaning Immigration buses more security and more pre departure checks make this one irritating stressful experience. AMS/CDG are a dream in comparison to transferring through. Security staff are apathetic slow and rude. I asked the time from one of them and the answer I got was ""time you bought a watch mate"".",2.0
713,After getting off the aircraft up 3 escalators down 3 escalators train to next terminal up 3 more escalators and then past immigration with only 2 officers working. Terminal 5 is a real mess of a terminal. Not very disabled friendly. So many people rushing off and on the transit train makes it hard to get on. Also I found terminal very hot.,2.0
714,The worst airport I have experienced for transfers. While traveling to Budapest I had to transfer through Heathrow while traveling British Airways. I had to take 3 different buses and go back through security even though it was just a transfer. I had to get in a bus from the plane to a station to wait for another bus to a different terminal. Then go through security again even though we never left the airport. Then take another bus to the plane! Returning through Heathrow was just as bad. This time it was two different buses a train and security check with an added carry-on search. My bag sat waiting to be searched while employees ignored it and were just standing around. When I enquired after ten minutes I was told it was next but I guess I upset someone as it sat for another 5 minutes. I understand security procedures but the person was miserable condescending and rude.,
715,Suffice to say I shall be avoiding LHR in the future. My outward and inward flights both connected in T1. So I mistakenly believed it would just be a case of following the signs for connecting flights perhaps a security screen and that would be it. I was wrong! On the flight out we had to get on a bus and were taken on a journey of the nether regions of the airport even though I wasn't changing terminal. But as I was connecting to an international flight it wasn't too bad just the expected additional security. However connecting to my domestic flight on the way back was a nightmare. It took 1hr 10min to get from one flight to the other in the same terminal! Passport control was a farce. Only 2 desks manned and no separate queues for EU and non-EU this just holds everyone up. So 30 min later I got through the passport desk (in about 5 secs). Then there was the biometric queue completely OTT for transiting passengers. Then the confusing way to get to security. Then the security screen. As noted before very rude inefficient staff. There is no reason the whole queue should stop because someone has been pulled over for screening but this is what happens. I will be avoiding like the plague. I'll transit through Gatwick in future. I transited through CDG in March and despite its bad rep it was a dream!,3.0
716,I use Heathrow on a weekly basis and find it a very easy experience. The terminals are clean and tidy easy to navigate through and security never seems overly busy. The Heathrow of 10 - 20 years ago is long gone and it is now generally a pleasant and easy experience.,10.0
717,I found Heathrow crowded confusing and chaotic. What should have been an easy change of planes became quite daunting. For some unknown reason the passengers seemed to be particularly rude. In some areas there seemed to be arbitrary random lines for everything without any airport officials paying attention so people were randomly jumping the lines. In other areas officials were cracking down so the lines were fairly orderly. I was very grateful when the ordeal was over and I was finally seated on my plane!,2.0
718,Needed assistance at airport waited 1.5 hrs for buggy as there was no driver then only 1 buggy. On return 1 buggy but 8 people needed assistance driver had to take some then come back for us. Just what you need after a 7 hr flight. Try not to fly out of Heathrow - back to Gatwick.,
719,Transferred from T5 to T3 May 30; an absolute nightmare at security. Our line ran out of bins an agent was heading toward us with a trolley of bins but then stopped to visit with a few colleagues. Then as she approached she told us they were for another line! None for us. Our agent finally slowly walked back to get some for us stopped to visit then stopped half way and went on break. Finally the agent replacing her told us to come forward and reach to get them. Then everyone had the wrong liquids bag and had to transfer into a bag provided by security. We were told to leave hiking boots on they would not set off alarm yes they did so boots back to scanner and I was x-rayed and wanded. Wondering if employees are into a work slow down as this is the worst we have ever experienced at Heathrow but it is never pleasant getting through their security. Also the agents were very rude and caustic in their comments. That said T5 is not nearly as bad but T3 i awful! Also all electronics must be removed from bags and must be our of their covers in T3. In T5 the covers can stay on. We will try to avoid Heathrow in the future!,
720,Check-in was quick security didn't take as long as I thought it would. The terminal building was easy enough to navigate with clear illuminated signs meaning I got to my correct gate with no problems. All in all a pleasant experience of Terminal 5 even had time for a spot of shopping too!,10.0
721,Heathrow airport departure security staff are a huge farce. Their behaviour is the most unprofessional I've experienced considering the amount of staff they have. I give their speed of performance a 1/10 and their conduct 1/10. Training needs to be overhauled especially in terms of socialising with other staff members whilst on duty. On my particular occasion after having waited 30 minutes for my bag to be manually inspected the security officer decided to leave his station walk slowly to his colleague manning the metal detector pat him on the shoulder say hello and walk casually back. Petty and unprofessional behaviour just because I asked them if they could speed things along since passengers at the airport are there to catch flights.,1.0
722,Arriving in LHR from YVR at Terminal 3 departing LHR for AMS at Terminal 4. Parts of the terminal 3 building are old and deteriorating although the terminal in general is of acceptable standard and cleanliness. Customs queuing was not too bad. Baggage arrived fairly quickly on the carousel. A fairly long walk from the plane to the customs hall followed by a very long walk from the arrival halls to the tube station. Departing from terminal 4: Terminal 4 was clean and looked pleasant. However food and drinks were very expensive. No free wifi was a disappointment. Queuing time to go through security was a bit on the long side. Overall LHR surpasses the performance of many North American airports but does not come close to the efficiency innovation and customer service aspect of some of the Asian Tigers (Singapore Hong Kong Seoul etc.).,7.0
723,Terminal 5. The first time I'd been there and I hope the last. Had 1 hr to connect from an incoming Miami to an outbound Manchester. Miami flight late by 20 mins. Took the wrong turn and after 20 mins managed to find the right desk. Flight closed and was told rudely that it was my fault so tough. Rebooked on a flight 2 hours 30 mins later. No staff to get help from. First class manager couldn't have cared less.,
724,Two visits to T5 during a recent business trip from Edinburgh via Heathrow and Madrid to Grand Canaria both of them memorable for all the wrong reasons I'm afraid. On the outward leg my flight was running late then delayed another 20 minutes until a landing slot was free and I missed my next flight to Madrid. When I attempted to rebook I was initially directed to the wrong desk by an airport employee and when I found the correct one I had to queue for 30 minutes. On the return leg my transit through Terminal 5 started smoothly enough with plane landing on time then I encountered the theatre that is airport security and no one does it better the LHR! The first act was a pleasant woman checking my boarding pass then a quick passport check at the next desk. Next I was a little taken aback when I had to have my photo taken 'for security purposes' apparently. I then proceeded to security screening I passed through without making anything bleep. After waiting 30 minutes for the gate to appear on the departure board I headed there and awaited boarding. Imagine my surprise when again G4S wanted to take my picture but had no wish to look at my passport nor any other official identification document. Another 10 minutes delay on the ground and I was finally out of that nightmare. My main gripe is with the taking of passenger pictures of a UK citizen at a UK airport on a domestic flight this is intrusion of my privacy and completely unnecessary. My passport verifies my identity and contains my photo. I travel about 30k miles year on business and have instructed our travel company not to book me any flights via LHR again unless it is absolutely and instead send me via Amsterdam or Paris even if it means more time travelling. I will also be conveying my experiences to BA and I encourage others with similar experiences to do the same.,2.0
725,Flew out of Terminal 5 to South Korea on 13 May 2013 and my experience was a good one. The airport was easy to navigate and was spotlessly clean. Notice boards were well sited and displayed necessary information in plenty of time to enable you to get where you needed to be. All in all a pleasant experience.,10.0
726,I made a connecting flight on May 10th 2013 - Rome to London to Toronto on BA with my checked baggage being sent through from Rome to Toronto without my having to collect and recheck it at Heathrow. Rome flight left late arrived late and I ended up accompanied by one of the connecting flights personnel running through Terminal 5 from one gate to another to make the Toronto flight. Despite not having left the secured area I had to submit my carry-on bag for re-inspection and my duty free purchase was confiscated. I feel this is unreasonable - I purchased duty free in good faith and presented my boarding pass in Rome to do so had it bagged accordingly at Heathrow I never left the secured area and was in the company of a BA connecting flights representative from the moment I set foot off the Rome plane until I started down the jet way to board the Toronto flight. Between Heathrow Security and British Airways the matter of how you deal with those on immediately connecting flights should be reviewed. Surely this doubling of scanning and arbitrary seizure of duty free goods is a waste of time personnel and goods. Connecting passengers are under your purview the entire time they are in Heathrow. There is neither time nor opportunity to purchase duty free while sprinting to the gate. (There isn't even time to go to the bathroom). The icing on the cake was the 45+ minute wait in the Toronto plane on the tarmac before we were finally cleared for take off. A bad experience all around and a lousy end to a holiday.,
727,T3 last month. Arrivals OK Departures dreadful horrific queuing with no space for proper queue management. Awful security area especially if you get stuck behind someone with multiple 'problem items'. The Departures Area itself is basically a big shopping mall with planes parked out the back. Facilities for the passengers? well unless it involves shopping forget it. All in all a fairly dismal airport which I endeavour to avoid if at all possible.,3.0
728,Used Terminal 1 for a return flight to Moscow Domodedovo using Transaero with 3 other family members. Its noticeable how the efforts are trying to be made by Heathrow as a whole to try and improve its status (terminal 5 being a prime example) but there is still room for improvement. Interior looks very dated. Transaero seem to have their check-in zone tucked away from the main area so its a bit of a task trying to locate it. When we arrived there was an ominous-looking queue and we had noticed that the delayed take-off kept on getting extended every 5 minutes! Turned out that our plane was still in Moscow because of the weather so there was a 6-hour delay at most. We were given £25 to spend each in the airport though which explained the queue. Security was surprisingly swift very friendly staff. Giraffe restaurant very good not too expensive. Waiting seats are very hard comparable to park benches. Free Wi-Fi and good range of plug sockets. Something striking is the very long distances to walk to gates. It was a good 10 minute walk even with travelators! On return taxi to gate was very swift and we left the plane quickly. Immigration is in desperate need of a review in terms of services. Very long queues insufficient tables for filling out details (for some reason we weren't given them on the plane). Very grateful to the assistant who led us to the front because of the children (we had already waited 40 minutes). Unfriendly staff at immigration but on the other hand our baggage was all ready for collection and we were able to leave quickly from baggage reclaim.,6.0
729,Flew from T4 on Friday evening of bank holiday weekend. A much improved terminal where everything runs smoothly. Good staff. Nice facilities. Still too many 'upper end' shops as with the other terminals but overall very good with no queuing.,9.0
730,Passing though T5 on my way to Glasgow coming from Singapore. Boarding pass checked 4 times pictures taken of you and staff chatting among themselves instead of trying to get the crowds moving. Airport melted down my 2hour stop over time to nothing - reaching the gate with the final call.,
731,Arrived from Cape Town on BA58. Good flight with BA. However on arrival wheelchair not available as requested - had been provided at Cape Town. Around 12 pax had to walk up the ramp - some in obvious distress. A buggy waiting there took pax through immigration and then 'dumped' them in baggage collection. No help to offload luggage and no wheelchair through to the outside. BA refuses to accept responsibility and the airport ignores e-mails. This at T5 - Heathrow's newest terminal and BA's so call show piece. A dreadful way to treat elderly customers and people with limited mobility. I expected more from both BA and T5. Will avoid in future.,8.0
732,Arrived from Cape Town on BA58. Good flight with BA. However on arrival wheelchair not available as requested - had been provided at Cape Town.

This at T5 - Heathrow's newest terminal and BA's so call show piece. A dreadful way to treat elderly customers and people with limited mobility. I expected more from both BA and T5. Will avoid in future.,
733,I am all for Security but it is getting ridiculous at Heathrow Airport. Every case/bag seemed to get stopped going through the scanner - one person dealing with about 20 bags and she really took her time about things and kept going off to have a chat. At least one person missed their flight. My bag was stopped because the plastic bag I had my toiletries in was 'not a disposable plastic bag therefore illegal' - their words not mine! They then transferred what was in my see through bag which I have used every week for the last 10 months at every other airport to a 'legitimate' plastic bag. I had one toothpaste and one extremely small bottle of Bachs Herbal Rescue Remedy that would not fit so they told me I had to dispose of them! How ridiculous - I fly every week for work and all around the world will never fly from Heathrow again.,
734,These comments are specifically about Terminal 5. I have been through T5 twice each way in the last month. The last time was arriving this morning on BA72 (25/04/2013) from Muscat. The previous time was to and from Edinburgh. No particular problems on departure but on arrival on both occasions the plane had to be parked away from the Terminal and passengers bussed to the terminal. The process was slow and inefficient on both occasions - it took more than 35mins before someone found steps and buses etc and got the passengers unloaded. This is old fashioned passenger handling technology now only found at second rate airports - why are passengers using the new vastly expensive T5 expected to put up with it?,
735,After a long flight from Australia and landing in London I found it to be dirty no organisation staff not helpful or friendly a great welcome to the country. Toilets were disgusting considering this is a major airport. Not very well sign posted I ended up going up and down in the lift 3 times with my 3 year old daughter and a trolley as I could not make head nor tail where I was meant to go. Flying out from Heathrow I found not much choice to get something to eat or good coffee. There is hardly anywhere to sit before you can check-in and the seats are very uncomfortable. By far the worst airport I have been to!,2.0
736,Arrived 6.35 T5 from Sydney then bussed to T3 for connecting flight to Manchester not too much of a problem here then we and 300+ passengers queue for passport check. We had 10 mins until our next flight when others asked if they could go through quicker we were told no we had to wait our turn. We were then fast tracked through to security check which was chaos their attitude was very poor and as far as they were concerned being held up was not their problem. Unfortunately we had a duty free bottle of booze bought in from NZ with us which they took off us and told us abruptly we were not allowed to have this. We were then kept waiting 30mins before they would give my husband his hand luggage back and we missed our next flight. Would never want to use their airport again what impression do they give to overseas travellers to our country? Come on Heathrow get your act together.,
737,Flew EI from Terminal 1. Great swift check-in EI allow you to use any check in desk and they were fully staffed. Went through security (they take your photo) which was quick. Came to the departure lounge and it was very dirty and tired. Little shopping facilities apart from a newsagents and a bar/bistro! Proceeded to the gate which on the way you are security screened again. Apart from the computer not being able to match my photographs to my passport and a group of American Diplomats getting in the way it didn't take long. The Aer Lingus departure gates are very small and twisty with plenty of walking. Not enough seating at the gate. But the upside is the EI gates are very close to one of the runways so from doors closed to take off it took less than ten minutes! Not impressed with Heathrow but with the changes EI have made it's all good.,3.0
738,We travelled through Heathrow yet again this year having done it last year and although the experience was slightly better it still has a way to go. Yet again it was passport control where we felt let down. We were met by a young lady who tried to organise us into numerous queues allowing those in a hurry through first. However my gripe is directed at the 4 'officers' who were situated in the booth next to the one in use who were deep in discussion. If this was training It should have been done out of sight of travelling passengers or could a sign not be used to inform passengers that they are training and not just gossiping because that's what it looked like. Lots of staff around the full airport but I don't think they were all being used to their full potential and some not the most pleasant. As for the lines there it was bordering on the ridiculous as I fel we needed a map to get round them all. This may be one of the biggest airports however I would rather travel through a smaller airport and be treated by polite and friendly staff where I am treated as a human being and not a herd of cattle.,5.0
739,Arrived At T3 from Manchester then to transfer to T5 onward to Bangkok. However upon arrival there was no information on which buses to take the staff spoke broken English and were unable to understand and found the signage lacked appropriate direction. We were walking round for 30 mins then decided to just get a taxi which then cost £25 £6 of which goes to the airport we were told so we could catch our flight on time. We would consider ourselves seasoned travellers but this was the 1st and last time we will ever go to this airport.,2.0
740,Flew QF to Bangkok. It is the world's busiest Airport and you can tell. It is crowded and at places dated and dirty. Didn't impress me as that mighty world airport. The check in was quick. Arrival was a bit nasty. The customs officer poured over my passport a hundred times. The info kiosk was manned by a surly looking staff member who when I asked him a question he pointed me to a timetable and said its all in there. Duty free shops are lovely. Info display insufficient.,9.0
741,T5 on a Sunday at peak time. Good connection but I think due to light passenger load. All lines short even transfer security which can be a nightmare. Even a little humour from the staff - I think that their lack of this is often simply due to the monstrous number of not always polite people they have to deal with on some days. I wish there was more shopping for ordinary people but that is the way of most large airports now. One of my better T5 experiences.,8.0
742,T1. Lots of level changes and twisted corridors gate announced late - insufficient seating in general area to get you in the shops dirty floors. Long waiting times at luggage belt (25min) lots of traffic jams around the airport. Good range of destinations and frequencies.,2.0
743,T4 to HKG via DOH with Qatar Airways. Sunday afternoon departure Tuesday morning return. I've managed to avoid T4 until now and I was expecting the worst yet I was pleasantly surprised. No queues at check-in or security on departure. Pleasant choice of facilities airside with good runway views in places. Short queue at immigration upon return. The only let-down was the long wait for bags which arrived about 40 mins after landing.,8.0
744,The security staff appear to be a bunch of disinterested people and they treat with such disdain. The process used is ridiculous and seems designed to delay passengers. I missed a connecting flight because I inadvertently left the dregs of a small bottle of water in my bag. Rather than do the sensible thing (as is done at other airports) and ask me if I had any liquids they decide to remove my bag after screening and have me standing around waiting for more than 30 minutes. All that was needed was to have me identify the bottle of water remove and re-screen which would have taken 2 minutes. Instead they want to empty every item from the bag. Having been through numerous major airports around the world it is obvious to me that Heathrow is about the worst you will find. The expected lack of courtesy and service reminds us that we are in Britain.,
745,Heathrow to Colombo (UL504). The BA desk at Manchester advised that they could not through check pax or luggage to Colombo. Although the check in with Sri Lankan at HRW was smooth the delay in baggage delivery on arrival into T5 from Manchester transfer between terminals 5 & 4 and so called ‘fast-track’ security was a nightmare - taking almost 3 hours lost in total. The lounge in LHR Terminal 4 (Sri Lankan shared with Gulf Air) was one of the best we have used – very spacious and relaxing environment plus excellent attentive service with good quality regularly refreshed buffet food (European and Asian). For an indirect flight we will continue to use Heathrow but only provided this is limited to T5 and we can through check. Otherwise we will probably opt to transit in the Middle East (with Etihad or Emirates) to avoid the invariable delays landing into HRW and the T4 transfer/security nightmare.,5.0
746,I took the train from and to the airport. To say it doesn't is completely incorrect. I also had no problem with security they're very relaxed and got me through. You can get anywhere in less than an hour without struggling too much. It's a good airport. As for flights mine got there early and the other left on time. I took American airlines which was very good at that time. I was there in Jan. 2012.,8.0
747,It took almost 40 minutes to clear the X-Ray area and I almost missed my AC 859 flight to Toronto on Feb 20 2013. Heathrow T3 needs a revamp just like we had it here in Toronto at Toronto Pearson Intl and it will be once again a great place to fly. Heathrow used to have free calls to landlines from the pay phones not anymore. Staff are rude but departure lounge is clean and ample seats await you prior to boarding.,6.0
748,One can only comment on ones own experience we have passed through terminal 5 twice in the past month arrived on a BA flight at 1215 on 25/01/13. Immigration was super fast despite automatic system being a failure made Miami look like a backwater. As for transport we had cleared immigration and collected baggage caught the rail air coach to Woking then train to Aldershot by 1445.,8.0
749,"This airport lacks the amenities that ""international"" airports worldwide have as standard features. For instance the connections between terminals should be by fast rail system rather than old dilapidated buses which get stuck in traffic or if an accident happens in the tunnels. I had a rough time connecting between T1 and T3 on my flight to Dubai. The buses which were supposed to run every 5 minutes where not showing up for good 45 minutes. The airport staff didn't understand the plight of the passengers that their outbound flights may leave without them. I had to rush myself through the security checkpoint (several security checks in fact) and then reached the Emirates Airlines counter which they told me the boarding has closed. I had to literally beg/demand them to get me onboard. I would not recommend this airport to anyone.",4.0
750,Used Heathrow several times. Never ever known a flight to leave on time. Not once. Connections to central London okay but if you are coming from anywhere else in Britain bad luck. The bus station is appalling. You can't book a bus ahead because you know you're always going to be late. Spent too many hours at that horrible bus station because inevitably the next National Express is a 2 hour wait. Usually you also spend too much time circling London before arriving in London. The terminals are old and depressing. It's like a flash back to the 70s. I've travelled a lot and this is the worst airport I've ever used. If you're going to London use Gatwick. If you're going to Europe go for Amsterdam or Rome or if desperate Paris.,
751,Security at Terminal 5 is absolutely horrendous. Not due to having to be stringent not due to security measures but due to absolute incompetence. After passing through x-ray they wanted to take a second look at my laptop bag everything was removed that was supposed to be. I was stood for 25 minutes before anyone even decided to look at it this is while they are chatting away. In total it took 45 minutes to get through and I almost missed my flight. Every other airport I have been too simply pick the bag up straight away search it re-scan and then you are away. I have no problem at all with security at airports it is required and everyone is safer because of it but do not put a bunch of lazy staff to look after it.,
752,Transited through Heathrow Terminal 5 in Dec 2012 and then again in January 2013. This terminal is awful. The food is all terribly expensive. The shops are so expensive that no one actually purchases anything from them. The two stores that passengers were buying anything at all are Boots and WH Smith because they have the least expensive items in all of the airport. Security is completely out of hand. Security is overwhelmed due to the number of passengers that travel through this airport. It is my thought that Security has a policy of confiscating items for twofold reasons you're tired and don't want to even bother questioning and that they want you to go purchase the item from one of the stores in the airport. There are few comfortable places to sit and in most cases not enough places to sit. Interesting that they can't have a quiet zone for adults. I will never transition through this terminal again.,1.0
753,Awful experiences (twice in 8 months). Yesterday the flight from Madrid an Airbus 340 was left for more than half an hour with 300 passengers inside - because nobody in Terminal 5 approached the passenger bridge. After waiting for so long in that claustrophobic situation a staircase came. On another occasion after Easter before the Olympics we were less fortunate. We were left in a parallel landing runway for 30 minutes while other planes were taking off and landing close to us. Explanation? No position was available to disembark. Never again.,
754,Terminal 4. Now BA has vacated the facilities have reduced too. There is no non affiliated lounge. No Priority Pass access at all. Security was reasonable. Impossible for Collect at departure area traffic officers impound your car if you attempt to gain access to drop off area without a passenger on board - had to pay for car park for a 10 second transaction. Inbound E gates are not operational after 10pm so can not comment on their use. In general bad experience in what should be a first rate airport terminal.,5.0
755,The terminal 5 once you get through the customs and search areas is excellent. The shops and food areas have plenty of choice. The seating areas are comfortable and plentiful. You have to take a short train to get to the actual departure gates - make sure you leave early enough but they are often and fast. The terminal is well marked and easy to figure out the gate locations. The place is large interesting and efficient.,10.0
756,Through T5 just before Christmas. The whole transfer experience is so much better if you are bussed from your plane as this avoids the escalator/train. Very busy but the security wait was only 10-15 minutes and this at the peak arrivals time in the early am. Of course not enough Immigration desks open for U.K. citizens but we have come to accept that as the norm. Total plane to lounge time around 45 minutes. If only one could always expect this T5 performance could be considered good but sadly not the case. Comments apply to this visit only as o many others were not this good.,7.0
757,I like T3 it's fairly modern and easy to navigate outside and in and I like the feel of the check-in desk. I flew with Qantas and even though they had two desks open and only 3 people in the queue for the flight I still had to check myself in on the computers at Zone F which took way too long at least 10 minutes even more if your not good with computers. Getting through the boarding gate was also a nightmare was standing for at least 40minutes the staff were just too slow. T3 is good though it has decent shops/restaurants/bars and quite a lot of them. One thing that obviously needs improving though is the security check/x-ray. It was very disorganised mainly due to staff chatting and looking rather un-trained if I'm honest. It took ages to get through.,7.0
758,This is one of the busiest airports in the world but is one of the worst airports I have visited. Ground crew have no idea how airport service should be. Staff impolite and sometimes rude especially during the security check. They spent the time chatting amongst themselves ignoring everybody waiting next to the conveyor belt. Took 10 minutes to wait for my bag to come out. Terminals not clearly marked. Very confusing and chaotic. Awfully dirty terminal crowded and cramped. Good airport facilities with enough souvenir shops but staff were not nice at all. Lack of efficiency in this airport.,2.0
759,Three recent return flights from T1. I must be one of the lucky ones as I've had no major problems. All flights more or less off on time. Ground staff and security were all fine although on one occasion they took a little too much interest in my hard drive and drug-screened my whole bag and re-scanned it twice - rather over-zealous I feel. Check-in very quick on all occasions - no queues. All flights held in holding patterns but no significant delays. The usual good facilities airside. No problems on arrival other than 15-20 minute waiting times for bags. Immigration quick efficient friendly and adequate staff.,9.0
760,"Flew from the Middle East on December 20 2012 to Terminal 4 transferred to Terminal 1 to make a connecting flight. Security staff at Terminal 1 rude chatting amongst themselves while they decided to select my carry on for a random search by a woman with a poor command of English. Both I and my colleague explained that we had to make a connecting flight staff couldn't have cared less continued to take their own sweet time chatting amongst themselves told us and other people travelling with small children to ""be patient"" before attempting to open our luggage. We missed our flight staff at the British Airways desk were sympathetic and concurred that security staff in Terminal 1 were rude to them and have resulted in many passengers missing flights. Heathrow airport transfers are not for the faint hearted poor signposting I would not recommend for anyone elderly the distances are huge and it is easy to get lost. Very dated.",4.0
761,I've come through Heathrow five times this year so far and it's always a breeze and never have to wait more than 10 minutes waiting to get through customs. The revamp of T3 and T4 are great. Free airport Wi-Fi was near impossible to get on as with most airports. No free kiosks either or places to plug in devices. No places to lay down only seats. There was a couple of TV's showing sports but you couldn't hear them very well due to the noise of the hundreds of people in the terminal etc. Heathrow still feels dated in places mainly baggage claim and customs. Compared to some SE Asian airports like Singapore we are a decade behind.,8.0
762,LHR Terminal 4 Wednesday 12 December 2012 19.05. Queue of more than 1 hour (which you don't know when you step in) probably because of fog in the morning (if there were more runways this issue would not have been so severe). No communication as to why this situation exists when asking for help there was no willingness to support passengers having to catch their flight. No system dividing between people with earlier flights and people with later flights. No apologies given. Very very slow security: one scanner for 2 baggage lines. No separate baggage line and scanner for Fast track. If the scanner beeps you have to wait for more than 2 minutes so queue gets even longer. Very poor service of LHR terminal 4 please improve. Thanks to KLM I did not miss my flight.,
763,T4 security queue made me miss my flight (1 hr 15 minutes in the queue). What is the use of flying if you have to be there two hours before just to go through security. Next time I'll definitely try to avoid Heathrow.,
764,Travelling to London from Palm Springs via Dallas (frequently) we arrived at Terminal 5 which was very impressive clean efficient our luggage took minutes to arrive and we were through immigration in 15 mins. They were polite and welcomed us. Departing T5 was a breeze lots of helpful staff spacious light and pleasant check in hall. Security fast and efficient and more shops and restaurants than I have seen at any other airport other than possibly Amsterdam but the food is much better at T5. Interesting to hear Americans moan about immigration lines I have been in line for 4 hours at LAX on 3 occasions and similar waits at MIA on many occasions. I do agree that free WiFi would make a huge difference but over all I think it is one of the best terminals in the world.,10.0
765,A tale of two Terminals - my flights into and out of Terminal 5 were fine with courteous security staff and immigration officials. However my experience at Terminal 1 was horrific and echoes many comments also written here. The worst aspect for me was having my bag (laptop bag in my case) taken aside for a random second inspection but then seeing it left there for ages in a rack while staff laughed and chatted amongst themselves seemingly oblivious to the fact that we have flights to catch. At Australian airports such 2nd random searches are carried out promptly and courteously by another officer further on in the process and that's fine. However at Heathrow Terminal 1 I had my bag left in a side rack for ages with staff wandering off somewhere else for a chat and a laugh. I for one will try to avoid using Heathrow Airport and spending money at its airport hotels and restaurants and instead spend my time and money using a northern European hub such as Frankfurt in the future.,3.0
766,It had been many years since I last visited Heathrow so I was essentially starting afresh. This was the final part of a lengthy flight from Adelaide to London via Sydney and Singapore so I was hoping for a smooth experience. Fortunately this was what I got. We had an easy departure from our plane despite having to wait till last due to having a family member on crutches. The airport staff immediately arrived with a wheelchair for assistance and then fetched a golf buggy to get us around quicker. Staff were very friendly and we got through immigration within a matter of minutes. Having had to wait behind on the plane our bags had concluded their cycle on the conveyor belt so ours had been placed to one side to collect which further sped things up. Restrooms were extremely clean and modern we managed to navigate the airport with little or no problems at all and the freezing cold outside instantly shook off any lost sleep on the flight.,8.0
767,I hate transiting through Heathrow specifically for two reasons: Immigration control and security. I have to clear immigration before connecting to my UK flight and there is always no more than two Border Agency officers on duty. They are either belligerent or disinterested towards non-EU passengers like myself. There are two lines-one for EU citizens and the other for non-EU citizens-where each time the officers give preference towards EU citizens while ignoring those in the non-EU line. My advice is for non-EU citizens to make sure to have at least 2 hours to transit because of this ridiculous practice. As to security it has become a nightmare recently. On my most recent experience my handbag was 'randomly' selected for a thorough search. To make matters worse the security officials take their leisurely time. I did not have my handbag checked until after a good 20 minutes of waiting around. They do not care that many passengers are in a hurry to catch their flights! Instead I noticed officials joking and talking amongst themselves oblivious to these randomly selected bags they need to check because passengers are waiting for them! This type of supposedly extreme checking is a huge farce really accomplishes nothing but hassle to the passengers. If not for the immigration & security issues Heathrow's T5 is quite nice provided one has time to actually relax and shop and eat. I lost so much time on my outbound journey due to the idiotic procedures of immigration and security that I could barely get to buy some water and use the toilet.,1.0
768,I had an outbound and inbound flight to T5 so I will write them separately. Outbound: Excellent in one word no queues extremely fast first check in with courteous staff and staff that appeared interested in you and your plans. Passport control and security was empty and so we split up between fast track and normal both ending at the same time. I was searched and x-rayed routinely but it was an efficient and non-invasive process. Excellent facilities for shopping and eating but there is one drawback with T5 which is the short amount of time they leave to publish the departing gate number which was alright for our flight as it was an A gate but there were B and C gates being called close to departure which does not allow for enough time to be given to transfer to the satellite terminals comfortably. Boarding was pleasant with priority boarding and happy staff. Inbound: The C satellite terminal had problems trying to attach the tunnel to the plane which meant we lost the 20 minutes of flight time we had made up as well as extra time but the captain and crew were very reassuring. Once we were disembarked the transition to the main terminal was quick and efficient with a train for the transit system arriving at C as we made it to the platform. Immigration was fast with staff that wee polite and friendly and too interest in your travels. By the time we reached the carousel our luggage was coming round resulting in disembarking to taxi rank in just under 20 minutes.,9.0
769,I absolutely loath having to travel through LHR for a number of reasons. Nasty cramped dirty and poorly laid out waiting area for the departure gates at terminal 3 which has only wildly overpriced junk food available to eat. The approach to the check in counters from the underground must rank as some of the worst anywhere in the world with water leaking from behind a wall seeping across a filthy floor making it extremely slippery and dangerous. However the absolute worst aspect is the understaffed immigration queues. I know it's a constant complaint of those of us unfortunate enough to have to use this airport but management seriously has to start to listen. Clearly understaffed the few officials who are tasked with processing arrivals are obviously over stretched and are struggling to cope with what is being asked of them. I don't blame them for being snappy and irritable as the job they have been given is close to unmanageable but its an absolutely appalling way to welcome visitors to this country to make them stand in endless queues while only 3 or 4 counters out of an available 20 or so are staffed. Penny pinching is really making LHR a place to be avoided at all costs.,1.0
770,There has been an enormous effort put into making the facilities and environment here fit to be confirmed with other major international airports but if an airport can't get planes away on schedule it all starts to seem a bit irrelevant. Last time I caught an international flight from Heathrow it was 3 hours late. Gave it a second chance - and this time my flight was 4 hours late getting away. Will not be using it in future.,2.0
771,Have travelled to and from LHR a number of times over the years. There have been improvements and the airport generally is pretty user-friendly. Even Terminal 5 is good after the initial horrendous problems to the traveller from USA who thinks that Heathrow has the worst layout of any airport in the world have you never been to Miami International Airport?,8.0
772,Like many major international airports London Heathrow has both its assets and downsides. On the positive side it's an extremely clean stylish and very modern looking airport. The eating and shopping options are without a doubt the best there are not only in Europe but possibly the world. The signalling within the airport is clear and concise so losing yourself is hard to do. However Heathrow is rife with poorly mannered employees (most of whom do not speak any other language other than English) long lines everywhere (especially as passport checks these can last for ages) overly priced shops and frequent delays. If you are transiting through the UK's biggest airport give yourself at least a 2-3 hours layover.,5.0
773,The airport is old and the efficiency is very low. Although the airport is very big I got easily confused in the airport. I waited for 10 min for the X-Ray scan excluding the queue up time. Heathrow should be one of the best airports in Europe and shouldn't be like this.,2.0
774,This is the worst airport I have ever travelled through. The security staff at the X-ray are rude and insulting. I had my bag emptied onto a bench in front of everyone. When I asked if there was a problem I was told it was random. If you can avoid it.,
775,One of the worst airports only 1-2 officers dedicated to fast track many times the whole flight has passed immigration and the first class passenger is still way back in the queue.,
776,Flew into T4 LHR on 13/11/12. It was very quick indeed 20 minutes from landing to immigration (even used the self-scanning system not sure of the point as no quicker than a real person and seemed a little temperamental) baggage and customs to leaving the airport. What a breeze and well done.,9.0
777,Used T4 in October/November. The first negative point about T4 is that if you travel on Heathrow Express from central London you have to get off at Heathrow Central (For T1/3) then wait for another train to T4. Check in was smooth and less chaotic than T3 despite during busy hours. Security check was fast if you don't get picked up for additional check. The shopping area very dark and uninspiring not many choices either. Poor food and beverage selections and there is no Priority Pass lounge available. Arrival was good. Not too long walk to the immigration (unlike T3) and there wasn't a long queue for EU/UK passport holders. Different story for foreigners though and I did have a lot of sympathy for the poor passengers who had been on a long flight and had to wait for another hour or so to go through immigration. Bag arrived very fast which is consistent with all other terminals in Heathrow.,5.0
778,Terminal 4. Departing - far more enjoyable experience than T3. Nice range of facilities clean easy check in experience security a breeze and quick boarding. Hassle free experience. Arriving - 30mins circling London at 6.30am Sunday morning. Not much space in baggage collection area but smooth easy connection to Tube. However Passport Control big queues. Lots of flights must have arrived at same time but few staff (especially on international desks) - queue was well past the 'at least 45 minute board' down corridor before even reached the hall and lack of signage was confusing as queue was way before a sign highlighting which queue to join. E-gates were playing up but got through manual control reasonably fast and out the door in 30mins from getting off plane. International passport holders would have been much longer!,7.0
779,Not for the first time has a flight been changed from gate 8 to gate 80 with little or no notice and it's a fair walk. Something to be aware of if your flight is posted for Gate 8.,7.0
780,Definitely the worst airport I've ever transited. The availability of wheelchair assistance was spotty and the wheelchair assistance co-ordinators were not polite. When we really needed one there was no one at the assistance station at all. We missed our flight and were delayed 24 hours. Even without assistance challenges Heathrow has the worst layout of any airport in the world. I would have thought it would be better after the Olympics. Not so. Transferring between terminals is interminable.,
781,Arrived to check in at T5 for early eve flight to Philadelphia. Absolutely no queue at the Bag drop and was quickly checked in by the welcoming check in clerk. Security was quick and efficient. Boarded from C gates which were very quiet. Efficient well organised boarding.,10.0
782,"Terminal 5. Bag drop queues were long about fifteen minutes passed through fast track into security to be delayed over half an hour because they seemed to be taking every other bag for additional screening. Bags and passengers were stacked up waiting for the two screeners to get round to them. They unpacked each bag completely and swabbed them all and every hard surface in each passenger's belongings. They even searched my wallet! They found nothing of course in any of the eight bags/passengers in front of me in the line. What a waste of time and resources. My previous good opinion of T5 now in ruins. The ""pod"" transfer from car park to terminal however was fast and efficient.",1.0
783,Arrived T3 and had an outbound at T5. While going through T5 security they were picking out every 3rd or 4th persons bags for screening stood there for 30 minutes until they got to our bag unloaded every item one by one at a glacial pace. Then went over to do the swab talked with their buddy and finally returned. 10 people were waiting for bags to be gone through at least and then he leaves leaving all of us standing there with no replacement. We will go around London next time.,
784,Came through the fast track and had my bag set aside for a search. I waited 10 whilst the staff stood and had a conversation. They then put my bag back through the scanner but then decided they wanted to search it anyway. My bag was then taken to the other end of the security hall and put through another scanner whilst the staff member stood and chatted to his colleagues. He then brought my bag back and painfully slowly emptied every single compartment. He opened the pouch that had all the cables for my laptop in and zipped it back up without even looking in it. After the bag was completely emptied he asked would I like him to re-pack my bag. I packed it myself to save time. He made a mockery of the security at T1.,3.0
785,I recently arrived at LHR Terminal 4 and departed Terminal 3. I had Fast Track both ways. My United flight arrived 40 minutes early at Terminal 4 and I was expecting a breeze in the Fast Track line. Unfortunately the line was long in the Fast Track line and took over an hour. I departed from Terminal 3 and there was nobody in the Fast Track line. However my bag that went through the X-Ray screener required a personnel to search it. I had to wait over 20 minutes till the security agent got to my bag. They explained that they are very short staffed. I think this is unexcusable for the busiest airport in the Europe that just had the Olympics there. Terminal 3 itself is nice and had a lot of restuarants and shops.,6.0
786,Came back via Madrid into T5 and after Immigration where they were still welcoming visitors to the Paralympics 10 days after it finished - how hard can it be to revert the screen messages? We went to baggage reclaim. Followed the signage to the relevant belt and waited. Eventually cases started to trickle out now about 45 minutes from landing time but not ours. Asked a passing worker how long it should take and were told about half an hour but maybe check for other Spanish origin flights. There weren't any but as our concern and indeed panic rose we began walking the length of the hall checking every belt where eventually we found one case on the belt for a flight from Abuja Nigeria. After nearly an hour we were about to go to baggage enquiries office when the last case appeared on its own again on the Abuja flight belt. You have to ask what kind of system manages to misplace not one but two cases so very far from correct. This terminal appears still not to have fixed its problems.,1.0
787,Arrived morning (07.30) of 14 July into T5: no queue at passport control and the luggage began to come through as I arrived at baggage reclaim. Time from aeroplane to taxi rank was 20 minutes which was quite good considering half of that was spent going from the gate to passport control. Passport control person was not impolite which made for a nice and very welcome change.,10.0
788,Flew out of Heathrow to Warsaw from Terminal 1. Found it to be fine with little queuing and good facilities. Staff mostly friendly too.,9.0
789,The improvements I have noticed from Heathrow are absolutely fantastic! Years ago however it was a different story and I'm glad that this can be said! Terminals are clean well decorated and for the most part have excellent shops! Overall had a very satisfying experience there and a fantastic welcome back to the UK. Staff were very friendly!,10.0
790,I usually fly from T1 or T5 but this time went through T3. It has improved. Check-in staff at SAS were excellent and quick no need to queue and wait same when I got to the gate no waiting to board aircraft. Passing through security was no more then 5 minutes. Then the path meanders through Duty Free which I could do without. Waiting area a bit crowded plenty of choice of places to get food and drink and other luxury shops. Good and clear signage and the walk to the gate not too long. Could do with a few more toilets in the waiting area one seemed to be closed. Return also smooth. No difficulty at passport control in fact staff there friendly and had a little chat over why the automatic gates don't seem to recognize my passport. 20 minute wait for luggage which is not unusual for Heathrow. The terminal has improved since my last trip through it. The only frustrating downside was the free wi-fi did not work and on my return leg finding the way to the underground was not well indicated.,7.0
791,My husband and I arrived at LHR T1 recently returning from India. For the second time in our travels we had more hassle at T1 than in the Indian airports we had visited (and we've been through all the major ones). After being told to keep my shoes on when I got through the initial scanner I was curtly asked to remove my shoes so that they could be scanned. After being frisked and finally the metal detector run across me (this is the first thing they do in India by the way) and being told to put nothing back into my pockets my belongings were gathered together by one of their officious security staff members I had to go through the body scanner after which I was frisked again. Have they never heard of metal buttons on jeans? After that the three officials started chatting and I actually had to ask if I was free to go.,4.0
792,Wheelchair help through the airport atrocious. No help at all in early morning. Non walking person had to walk quite a long way to find a lift then the help station was unmanned. Eventually we did get a wheelchair. Grudging service. What a difference in other European airports where service is fast and friendly. On arrival back in UK we were passed between 3 different people and then after a 20 minute wait for a chair the attendant on the help desk suggested that my non walking husband walk down to the baggage claim and collect the luggage then come back and wait for a chair! When we finally did get a wheelchair the attendant kept stopping to chat to friends other airport staff. When I asked if we could get on and go to baggage claim and immigration the friend to whom the chap pushing the wheel chair was chatting began to laugh at us. This is not good enough Heathrow. You do not measure up to the standards set by other European airports.,2.0
793,The queuing time at Heathrow was quite reasonable and the staff were quite efficient and friendly. Check-in and immigration went quite smoothly. The airport was quite crowded though so it was a bit annoying to find a place to sit. There's no free Wi-Fi which was quite disappointing. And I think that the shops were quite expensive compared to other large airports.,8.0
794,Appalled at the rudeness encountered at immigration. Immigration officials do not have to be rude when they encounter someone such as myself entering with no known address. A simple statement that an address is required is sufficient. I believe that most people are reasonable if approached in a polite manner. There was no name badge worn by the two people I encountered making it impossible to lodge a complaint against them. Left a bad impression.,2.0
795,Arrived from JFK into T5 from overnight flight. Bit of a walk and internal transport from arrival gate to immigration/bag reclaim. No problem with immigration queues and bag arrival was fast - I mean fast compared with the usual wait of up to 1hr where BA have previously been concerned. On arrival in baggage hall bags already on their way through. All round a very smooth and pleasant experience.,10.0
796,Connected in Heathrow from Terminal 3 to Terminal 1. Terminal 1 was nice great shops services restaurants one of the best I have seen anywhere. Didn't see the other terminals but based on Terminal 1 I would say Heathrow should be a 5 star airport. Very impressed.,10.0
797,Terminal 5 is a breeze. Connected through the airport 3 times over the past 3 months and each time Terminal 5 was working smoothly. My only complaint is the late notice of your gate but only once did I have to take the underground train to Terminal 5C.,10.0
798,T3 - arrival. The airport was very clean. Had to wait to get through immigration for about 15 seconds. All the staff acted very pleasantly friendly and were asking where we had been etc. For the 3 of us we only talked to the customs officer for about 15 seconds also before we were let through. Well sign posted (BAA signs as well as ones for London 2012). There were plenty of staff about (as well as ones for London 2012). However we had to wait for about 15-20 minutes for our baggage to come through and we were almost at the normal bus stops before we saw a sign saying that the Hotel Hoppa had be re-allocated to the Central Bus Station (we had to back track through the terminal which was difficult) which seemed miles away.,9.0
799,Appalled at terrible lack of thought in to how passengers transfer from Terminal 4 to Terminal 5 (and vice versa). I was travelling from Terminal 4 but coming from Oxford on the bus which drops off at Terminal 5. There was no signage at all as to how to get between the two terminals. After asking airport staff we eventually found we had to take a local bus. There was no information as to whether the trip would be free (it was) and there was no space for luggage on the bus at all which if course most passengers had. Please improve this! Signs at least - but a dedicated transfer bus with proper luggage space would be better.,5.0
800,I found myself visiting three of the four terminals this summer on a return trip. Thankfully I must have travelled at the less busy times since I rarely experienced any long queues or other unpleasant aspects of using large busy airports. Zipped through T3 security and on the way back flight connections from T5 to T1 were well signposted and quick enough.,7.0
801,Arrived with Cathay Pacific from Hong Kong at 2.45pm on May 17th 2012 to find a huge queue at Passport Control in a zigzag formation everyone tired and only 3 control booths open so we waited over 50 minutes to be passed through to baggage and customs. What a way to be welcomed to London and the UK! And why don't countries dress up their entrance halls with advertising to boost their countries good points? Arriving in a bare concrete hall is the pits!,2.0
802,Flew out of and into Heathrow during the last weekend of the Olympics. Expected chaos but was all very smooth and seamless. No queues at immigration inbound although flight was one of the last ones in. Luggage on carousel when we got there.,10.0
803,T4 - two return trips in the past 3 months. Check-In's (Qatar and Etihad) not especially well organised. Security very slow and not a patch on the new facilities in LGW. Departures is basically a big shop with planes parked out the back. Facilities for the passengers? Who? What's wrong with shopping? Arrivals not too bad with most of the Immigration counters manned. The Baggage wait was an average of 45 minutes which is not good in a Baggage Hall which didn't appear to be especially busy. All in all not a great experience (but better than LHR T3 and not as good in any measure as LGW).,6.0
804,Terminal 5. I had great expectations when T5 opened but they were promptly dashed. Unbelievable to find a modern airport terminal where you still have to pay for internet use and with coins. Another piece of bad planning is the placing of the information signs when you come through departure security. As you gather your scattered belongings you look around for signs - and at first glance there is nothing. They're there but not immediately obvious. You have to wander around a bit and get the right angle of approach. Needlessly unsettling when you're already stressed. Terminal 4 - last experienced but never to be forgotten just before Terminal 5 opened. We were booked from Oslo to Johannesburg with BA but when the BA flight from Oslo was delayed we missed the connecting flight. We saw the last passengers go in and the doors close but the staff we pleaded with to get us on the plane were unmoved. We were put into a hotel and booked on the next flight to Johannesburg which was a KLM flight but unfortunately only early the next morning. We were issued with tickets for a bus that hadn't started running by the time we left for the airport. Our luggage of course remained at Heathrow. Over the next 2 weeks we phoned the airport daily. Yes they assured us our luggage was at Heathrow - they could even describe it to us. But at Heathrow it remained though nobody could explain why. It finally arrived the day before we left to go home.,4.0
805,Terminal 3. Crowds outside queuing for vat refunds then inside to a terminal which was absolutely packed and when I got to the business class check-in it was so loud that I couldn't hear the check-in staff giving me directions to the lounge - I had to call my daughter over to help me. Fast track was indeed fast and then up to the departures lounge which was crammed with people and no clear signs as to where the business class lounges were. Coming back (which on a previous trip was horrendous) was simple - straight through to the iris reading gates which were brilliant and then to the baggage carousels where my luggage appeared in minutes. T3 needs a massive overhaul for outgoing passengers - it's just not good enough for such a major airport.,5.0
806,Check-in was quick and smooth. Luckily upon arrival there was no queue at the immigration. Baggage claim was quick I didn't have to wait for long to get my suitcase. I travelled to Heathrow just few days before the Olympics and was expecting it to be busy but surprised myself as everything was smooth and quick.,8.0
807,Used Terminal 1 for flight from Belfast on 5 August. I was in T1 arrivals within 15 minutes of my flight arriving. Disembarkation process was fast and efficient and staff were polite and welcoming. Terminal was quiet and clean albeit a little outdated and rough around the edges. Given the intention to demolish T1 I can understand why BAA do not want to spend a significant amount on improvements but my main aesthetic criticism would be the underground tunnels that run from T1/T3 to the London Underground station. They are dirty poorly lit and create a bad first impression of the UK.,8.0
808,I'm afraid to say that Heathrow is well past it's sell by date. I am a regular traveller with Cathy Pacific out of Heathrow T3 but my last trip was truly unforgiving. I arrived at 6pm for the 8.45pm flight the terminal was packed like I've never seen it before the queue that was in front of the first class check-in desk was bound for Canada so I had to barge my way through that before I even got to the desk. Once checked in I had to make it to the stairs that take you up to security things was that all the queues were stopping people from getting to the stairs. It was total bedlam and there wasn't even any staff on hand to help solve it. Security was a disgrace the fast track lane was slower than the normal lanes! Inside it was even worse there is no order to it you arrive into a bottleneck that then leads into a retail duty free store. It was absolute madness and the worst I've ever seen it.,1.0
809,Terminal 3: packed low ceiling. Out-dated. Something should be done quite soon with this terminal. Terminal 5: stayed here during the snow blitz in 2010. Superb design much space lots of check-in counters friendly staff as well. The man let us check in much before we really should. Superb transit area as well. I can see issues popping up very quickly as it's such a big airport.,7.0
810,Arrived from Toronto at 6am ahead of schedule and made a swift transfer to Terminal 1 via Flight Connections. Immigration was also a breeze using the dedicated channel for domestic and Ireland departures. Owing to a ticketing problem I then had no choice but to return to Terminal 3 to see Air Canada/British Airways. In all it took 3 hours to re-negotiate the now-longer queues and make the repeat transfer - mind-numbing after a very long overnight flight! To Heathrow's immense credit I found practically every employee I met to be good-spirited helpful and tactfully humorous; from the lady transfer bus driver to the immigration officials. Several recognised me after passing several times through the Connections centre and they could not have been more charming making a pretty unpleasant experience seem not so bad after all.,8.0
811,Every time I use T5 I regret it. Is it a job requirement that they will only employ rude staff? It made me cringe to watch a BA check-in team member twice shout loudly and rudely at a woman because she accidentally overstepped a line she should have waited behind. Or the immigration woman who was quite abusive to a lady who merely asked - not complained - why a retina scan was needed. Then there is the ability of T5 to lose my luggage even with state-of-the-art baggage systems and a 1.5 hour connection time. How do they manage it?,4.0
812,"Maybe I got lucky but the transfer experience when going between terminals seems to have improved considerably since my last time here. I was transferring from T5 (BA) to T3 (AA). Signage was generally good staff helpful and the queues short and moved quickly. They even have a special ""short connections"" line at the T3 transfer security area if you have less than an hour before your onwards flight. Perhaps being here early on a Saturday morning helped but I was pleasantly surprised after expecting the worst. I went from the gate at T5 to my seat in the lounge at T3 in just over 30 minutes; not bad at all for an airport this size. My one complaint is the lack of information on how to transfer to a non-BA airline. All you see are signs that indicate connections within T5 and for connections through ""all other terminals"". If you don't happen to know which terminal your airline flies out of this can be confusing. On the plus side staff were quite helpful in checking to make sure you were headed to the right line.",8.0
813,"LHR Terminal 5 on Friday 6th of July. I had the displeasure of waiting 26 minutes just to drop my bag at the check in counter which did say ""Bag drop"". Waiting time in security was no better with a 10 minutes wait. Generally speaking the check in experience was very poor and clearly showed that BA is the only customer in this terminal and they are contempt with aware. When I get to one of the many restaurants did the experience improve. Here service was fast and efficient. A visit to one of the many toilet showed them to be fairly well kept and in good working order. Sign posting is a bit messy mainly because the informative signs of where to go drowns in advertising posters for various tax free products. Overall a very mixed but rather poor impression of this new terminal. It could be so much more if just BA and BAA wanted it to.",3.0
814,Do not attempt LHR if you need wheelchair assistance - arrived from Seattle Sunday 11 am and were lucky to make our 3pm connection in T1 due to chaotic special assistance in T1. We were made to feel like a nuisance to be moved about rather than customers. Also security staff at T1 rude impatient arrogant and when I complained female supervisor backed them up and told me off! A disgrace I would hate to be arriving for Olympics. These staff need to seriously up their game. Have travelled on a number of occasions in USA staff are firm but polite. I am embarrassed for what visitors will think of Britain.,2.0
815,"My wife and I travel a fair bit and to date our worst ever experience was at Heathrow Airport. It all started off with a queue that stretched beyond the 1km mark fuelled by a 2 hour wait. We were flying in from Australia with a stop over in Dubai. After a long flight I couldn't remember the address of my friend's place where we'd be staying for a few nights (in London). Once we walked up to the immigration office I promptly apologised for the missing information and informed him that I did have it on my email but can't access it since there wasn't any free Wifi access in that terminal (we flew Emirates to London). The immigration officer rudely pointed towards a row of people who were detained and I believe would've been checked for drugs illegal travelers etc. He said and I quote ""next time you forget the address you will be sitting there till you remember where you will be staying"" and smirked. I was shocked to see this attitude from someone who was my first point of contact with London. I can't imagine the treatment people will receive when they fly in for the Olympics. I give Heathrow a big zero.",2.0
816,T5 arrival on evening of Sunday 17 June - arrived in the domestic area of T5A on a European flight due to the lack of availability of stands - slightly worrying that there are already such capacity constraints given that this facility is only 4 years old! We had to leave the aircraft via steps and then travel by bus to international arrivals. The terminal was clean and bright as usual but there were long queues at passport control (which I appreciate is more the fault of UK Immigration than BAA/BA). Once through passport control I was out of the terminal in about 10 minutes. Helpful to have an M&S in arrivals for essential food purchases and there is clear signposting to the Heathrow Express and London Underground.,6.0
817,Terminal 5 is great for shopping but seems to be designed to maximise walking. Huge queues at immigration and thoroughly charmless staff.,7.0
818,Terminal 3. Everything went smoothly for departure very little queuing for security enough seating airside.,8.0
819,An old airport and it shows the carpets are worn and dirt dust over everything. It needs a good clean. Signs are well posted and very clear. Border control - very long wait as is the luggage to be delivered on the carrousel.,5.0
820,T3. Arrived at Heathrow from Hong Kong early morning. I did not expect too much especially Hong Kong is claimed to be one of the best airport. However I was pleasantly surprised. Terminal 3 is old but some money has been spent to renovate the terminal. It is a long walk from the gate to the immigration check but there was no queue for European passport holders. Even for foreigners the queue was moving pretty fast. It took me less than 15 minutes from landing to immigration check which was impressive. Then I went to pick up my luggage and surprisingly they were waiting on the belt. It was a total 20 minutes from the time I landed to the time I got on Heathrow Express. Much more efficiency than Hong Kong. Maybe I was just lucky but I have had really good experience in T1/T3/T5 in the last year. Well done and I am looking forward to visiting Terminal East!,8.0
821,"Terminal 5 may be very attractive but it is a functional disaster. We were flying Business on BA with a 90 minute connection time. Despite being able to use the fast-track lines it still took a lengthy amount of time to get through the repeat security rigmarole. Our outgoing flight was leaving from a ""C"" gate which meant not only a hike to the train but a train ride then another hike to the gate. We arrived at the gate with only 10 or 15 minutes to spare - no time to visit the BA lounge - there isn't one in the ""C"" section anyway. Would suggest premium class passengers allow a bare minimum of 2 hours of connection - heaven only knows how much time economy passengers should allow - probably at least 3 or 4 hours. Will do my best to avoid connecting at LHR in the future even if it means extra cost or additional inconvenience. Everyone complains about connecting from International at O'Hare but that connection took 1/3 the time and 1/10 the hassle compared to our Heathrow connection.",2.0
822,T3 - old tired if I had a choice of direct flights from anywhere else in the UK I would go there. Very little seats around other then in the expensive food areas long lines for departure security and then got to front at staff change over time and had to wait while they all had a chat to each other. No fast food places before or after security so if your travelling with kids be warned. Plenty of expensive places to eat and as far as I can tell even the snack food is twice the price of the high street. Seats full there were 2 delayed flights. Long walks to some gates. On a plus side on return no lines at passport control but made up for by a long wait for bags to even start arriving.,4.0
823,Passport control T3 Saturday arrivals 19.00 (quiet time). Hand luggage only no checked bags. Was given a fast track pass and wished I hadn't bothered. The e-gates were closed (not that I can use these yet - old passport) and there were only two people serving the fast track queue. EU citizens were stuck behind more complicated immigration needs. It would have been quicker to join the regular UK/EU queue. The only way Fast track would work properly is either a) all 6 positions open or b) segregate UK-EU and Other in the fast track or c) Fast track only for UK-EU. Broadly speaking the 3 e-gates are an irrelevance and these should have their own queue. And the passport area was hot.,2.0
824,We had a two-hour layover between Boston and our connecting flight to Dublin. We arrived at Heathrow on time but missed our connection due to nightmare queuing and no less than 4 security checks (although we were so traumatized that we lost count). And we were not alone in missing that flight. On the return trip we had an almost 4 hour layover which allowed us to make our connecting flight but with not that much time to spare. Once again the queues were a nightmare. Heathrow provided us with absolutely the worst airport experience we have ever had bar none. We will never ever fly into this airport again. If you can avoid it do so at any cost. If you can't make sure that you have comfortable walking shoes not too much to carry and plenty of time between connections.,1.0
825,Arrived at terminal three from Hungary. The plane parked up on the apron and a series of buses arrived to transfer passengers to the shabby terminal with a long drive through a building site followed by escalators a broken down travelator and eventually to passport control - mercifully clear but clearly set up to cater for horrendous queues at busy times. The whole thing manages to function only because of goodwill from the staff at the airport but is a national embarrassment.,3.0
826,Flew with BA from Sao Paulo to London arrived at T5 early morning on a Thursday and had a wonderful experience at the airport no queues through border control clean modern beautiful terminal and arrived at Paddington in Central London very easily. In my opinion one of the best airports in the world.,9.0
827,Was a passenger only connecting via Heathrow T5. Stress and frustration is my only experiences at Heathrow. If T5 is the most modern of all the airports terminals then it is really one of the least efficient in the world. Our flight landed on time and although we were not exiting the terminal we went through the security process once again which is something I don't understand as transit passengers we were already scanned in our origin airport (in this case Zurich). This additional screening took over 2hrs and meant we were running for our connecting flight. Fast track was also backed up and provided little benefit. Bottlenecks at every screening points and nothing but frustrated passengers and staff. The layout and ineffective processes cannot help. Thank goodness we were not travelling during the Olympics. Good luck to those who do!,2.0
828,Arrived T3 to connect to T5. Spent 2+ hours in line at one check or another bus trip and more delay at another 2 check lines to finally get to boarding gate at T-5. Only had time for one toilet stop and spent rest of time on line and trying to get to gate. Flight was in final boarding when I arrived and barely made flight. Shameful experience at LHR for the traveller. Would not even consider coming back for an event in London if I had to transit LHR.,2.0
829,19th April. LHR-EDI. Terminal 5 a delight and massive improvement on other terminals. Modern design and bathed in natural light great views of the airfield. Just wish we had left more time to enjoy the views! Will definitely look forward to using T5 again in the future.,9.0
830,LHR-LAS-PHX-LHR. Very straightforward passage through T5 on outward journey. One avoidable hitch when we left the lounge for T5B. We were unloaded from transit for an apparent fault and put on the next. The first then left with people on it anyway. Impressively fast on the way back in spite of recent adverse publicity about the UKBF/UKBA. There was a wait for the transit at a busy time. There were queues at immigration but to my surprise IRIS was still in operation. Baggage handling was commendably fast but then a lot of time was wasted waiting for the inadequate and infrequent Hotel Hoppa. A broken toilet had a sloppy sign indicating more that it was not being fixed than it was likely to be any time soon. A key escalator in the still fairly new T5 was not working and another in the same sequence was taped off even though it was running. Heathrow should be very amusing during the Olympics but I don't plan to test that.,8.0
831,Arrived from Dubai early Tuesday morning 24 April tired after night flight with a one year old. Utter chaos through passport control. We were blocked from taking the Baggage collection route and were not advised how to get there. We went to Baby changing room by the baggage pick up which was a big room but only had one baby changing table! How ridiculous is that and what sort of impression does that give to visitors in a brand new Terminal? I wanted to transfer to the Bus Station I searched for signs to the bus station of which there were none was told I took the train to Terminal 1. No information on the train station as to which stop for the Bus Station.,1.0
832,I arrived at T5 on Wednesday 25 April as non-EU citizen from South Africa. I brought my elderly mother along. However at Border Control we had to queue for 2.5 hours with control officers leaving their desks often for coffee or breaks although there were many passengers waiting. I booked a shuttle service over Internet and our driver left the arrivals hall since we did not show up after 2-3 hours though the flight was not delayed. I had to call the company from the arrivals hall and they finally charged me 20 pounds extra for inconvenience.,1.0
833,Whoever is responsible for the queues on 25th April morning should be ashamed of themselves. Expecting weary often hungry and thirsty passengers to stand in line for 1 2 3 hours is just inhumane and unheard of! I travel to and from the USA at least 5 times per year and T5 is the worst border control experience I have ever had by far. I could not believe the chaos and torture that awaited for me when I landed just an absolute joke that it has been allowed to go on. One day a fluke - any more than that sheer neglect.,3.0
834,5:40am arrival on Cathay to T3. 15-20 minute walk from the gate to customs is excessive - a Skytrain is sorely needed. Customs queue was relatively short at about 20-30 minutes due to early arrival. Baggage claim was also fairly quick for the same reason. Terminal interior drab and not spacious all round. Overall very unimpressive for the world's busiest international airport.,4.0
835,Arrived at T3 at 05.45 from Singapore. Joined a queue of about 50 people in Fast Track - the queue behind me grew to hundreds in minutes. Two passport officers were dealing with Fast Track arrivals. After about 5 minutes one of the officers closed his desk down and walked off. Totally mysterious. I got through in about 30 minutes - God knows what happened behind.,2.0
836,Earlier this year I arrived at Terminal 3 of the 32 immigration desks available 3 were occupied by staff - lines were endless and the waiting time unacceptable. I later complained to the Border Agency they didn't even investigate the complaint. It was slow and chaotic and had nothing to do with robust border control if anything it made it seem something of a joke.,1.0
837,Arrived back at T5 last night. Transit took an age. No escalators working and then a queue that snaked all the way back from passport to the far end of the terminal. Olympic adverts everywhere - seriously need to get act together.,1.0
838,Just arrived on a flight from Madrid with BA into T5! What a mess! Queue for passports snaked all the way back to the escalators several thousand people no fast track for business class or first class passengers no Iris and no chipped passport readers working! 5 immigration officers on duty when we joined the queue and 3 more trying to police the irate passengers - by the time we reached the front of the queue there was only 1 immigration officer on duty even though there were 500 people behind us! T5 is a national disgrace!,1.0
839,Regularly travel to T5 for short and long haul travel. Since Christmas queues to get through passport control have seriously diminished the great T5 and BA travel experience. Arrived last night and joined long queue out of the immigration hall and back to the arrival gates. No sign of BAA airport managers just junior temps trying to control the crowds. Cannot understand how the Border Agency and BAA can allow this queuing to happen. Airport is full of adverts telling us that they are ready for the Olympics. Real shame as travel through T5 used to be a real pleasure. On the bright side experience with the airline (BA) remains first class - shame the airport operator lets them down.,5.0
840,Arrived back from Istanbul T5 was chaos at passport control with a queue that resembled something at Disneyworld snaking all round the area. Used e-passport queue which took an hour. Clearly woefully understaffed - what a welcome to the UK for foreign visitors - what it will look like during the Olympics does not bare thinking about!,2.0
841,How will T5 cope with the Olympics? Arrived T5 April 17 from Cape Town. Plane landed at 6.50 escalators were closed because they were worried about masses people of hurting themselves on it so only lifts available to a throng of people. Stood in Immigration line for 90 mins with 3 hungry sleep-deprived kids - partly because there were only 6 out of 24 terminals open. Immigration official said that this was normal for busy periods! Definitely one of the worst terminals for arriving.,2.0
842,One of the worst if not the worst major airport out there. Passport control lines at Heathrow are horrendous. Since all employees are unionized they make sure they take their bathroom lunch snack stress relief and other brakes so it is common to see 2 booths manned out of 50 while passengers are hoarded as cattle into lines circling the terminal.,2.0
843,Terminal 5 is a great asset to both British Airways and Heathrow. It is quick pleasant and quiet with a brilliant selection of food and retail outlets the waiting areas are very pleasant also. We always choose to fly BA over Virgin due to T5 especially compared to T3 which Virgin uses.,10.0
844,It is appalling how badly the system followed by Heathrow T4 to control passengers' bags works! 5 people sitting around chatting while 1 is leisurely checking customers' bags that are removed for additional checking for no apparent reason. Unbelievably poor experience which is underlined by the employees' suggestion to 'not use their terminal if u don't like it'. I guess airlines are happy to have their customers treated in this way and they do nothing to improve it.,1.0
845,MAN-LHR-SIN-LHR-MAN. Used T1 for MAN flights T3 for SIN ones. T1 arrival good and T3 departure and security checks were cleared quickly with minimal fuss. T3 does feel claustrophobic airside but good shop selection and used lounge which was good for money paid. Different story arriving T3 can only echo other comments. Passport control is a mess - IRIS working but big queue other self-scan gates not working. Luggage belt failed 5 mins into delivery due to strollers jamming it - passengers eventually cleared the blockage when it became apparent no baggage handlers would do so after 20 minutes. After another 45 mins bags arrived. T1 departure to MAN fine apart from the need to clear 2 security checks for the internal flight with an eye scan check taken at each station this is when no check needed for international flights? Given T3 experience can't see how it will cope with Olympic traffic unless problems addressed.,5.0
846,Travel to and from T3 and T5 all the time. T3 is a bit of a hassle and security takes a while but I always use the speedy queue. The thing that makes the difference is people who know what they are doing at security. Terminal 5 is very quick and you can go from club world or first desks straight through to the Concorde lounge almost instantly. Travelling with family to Newark NJ was very easy. It's the airlines that can make or break a journey and every single American airline that leaves Heathrow is appalling. Coming back into the UK is usually quick if you are a British citizen. Using e passport gates is very easy.,9.0
847,Flew out through T3. A dump. You enter airside through a massive retail area and there is insufficient seating. The low ceilings create a real claustrophobic atmosphere. If you want breakfast etc eat landslide. The outlets are a lot less busy and a lot more pleasant.,2.0
848,Arrived at T3 from HEL flew out from T5 to MAN. Immigration queues satisfyingly short. Renovation work means the T3-T5 bus trip isn't the most glamorous but they're making the best of it. BA Galleries Lounge at T5 could do with some more inspiring food choices. A long time since I've been through LHR and a few horror stories had me scared but this was a painless experience entirely.,8.0
849,Travelled through Terminal 5 on 31 Mar arriving at 2.15 pm from Canada. Immigration Control was horrible. It took 2.5 hours to clear through the non-EU non-UK queue. On the way home a week later I was stuck in one of the lifts from the Underground to Departures level for 25 minutes. We also had to board a bus to a remote stand for departure. For a new terminal using a remote stand for a Long Haul International flight is quite poor. Otherwise the terminal is really nice! Clean lots of food shopping and plenty of seats. The first contact arriving is the Immigration Hall. It's gives a really poor impression.,2.0
850,Flew in and out over Easter weekend. Inbound the immigration queues were horrendous as predicted. No excuse - just poor planning and management. An embarrassment to be British if this is people's first impression of the UK.,5.0
851,T5 is a pleasant experience modern and spacious though would like to see more eateries landside. Terminal 3 - cramped no natural light long walk to the gates. T4 and T1 average. Iris is used at immigration and costs nothing to add to your UK passport. Good links to and from London and frequent public transport to the nearby hotels. Unfortunately getting between terminals is a real pain in the backside. The bus service takes a long time and is every half hour or so the trains only runs every 15 mins leaving you stranded on the featureless miserable platform drumming your fingers if you have a tight connection.,3.0
852,"Arrived at T5 from MAN then T1 to WAW return. Mid-morning outward flight; no major problems before departure but the flight departed 35 minutes late. Facilities still good after security. Staff unusually friendly and polite. 3.5 hour layover upon return to await flight to MAN. After my connecting flight was called I learned I had used the wrong ""flight connections"" channel thus missing passport control after landing from WAW. Customs and security staff were understanding and helpful and ensured I did not miss my connection. Overall my impression is that customer service is improving at LHR. Cleanliness much better than my last flight from T1.",9.0
853,I have travelled through Heathrow twice in the last few weeks (T3 T5). In most respects the airport is fine and in particular departure security queues are much quicker than a few years ago. The problem is immigration control. On one occasion the queues were bad on the other appalling - even for EU passport holders. Lots of desks were unstaffed and the queue for the new e-passport gates seems to take even longer than the queue for the staffed desks. I travel around Europe for work almost every week and UK airports consistently have the worst immigration queues anywhere.,2.0
854,I fly into T5 regularly and transit to T1 for a domestic flight. Security is a nightmare. There are 10-12 scanners at T1 security only 3 or 4 are ever manned no matter how big the queue. Same story at the photographic check 6 camera positions only 1 is ever manned. If you arrive on a flight that is late you have no chance of making your connection if less than 2 hours. Security staff are generally very rude. Rules seem to change on a daily basis.,2.0
855,"I flew into Terminal 5 en route from California (via Dallas) to India. Navigating through Flight Connections was easy and I was through security in under 10 minutes. It is impressive in size although was surprised how ""unfinished"" some of the architecture is. Impressed by the size of the terminal and the large number of shops and restaurants. My biggest complaint is that T5 is simply not designed for long-haul transit passengers. Even if you do find a relatively quiet area there is a constant barrage of PA announcements. Since I was not a premium passenger I could not use the lounges and there are no pay lounges. Seating is uncomfortable and hard. It was such a contrast with an airport like Singapore Changi.",2.0
856,Flew into T5 on March 7 mid-afternoon to find passport control lines extremely long for non-UK passport holders. There were only 2 then 3 passport officers for plane loads of visitors. There were 24 un-manned desks. The EU UK and Iris Scan lines had passport officers and no lines. The Fast-Track line was closed which made no sense to those who had paid for that service. It took 2.5 hours for our group to get through. Passengers grumbled quietly and behaved patiently. No special assistance offered to travelers with young children and babies. I did not feel welcome at all to the UK with that queue and do not recommend coming back!,3.0
857,Last week used T5 for 2 arrivals and 1 departure. No lines for check-in or security well organised boarding called by row. Toilets clean and well stocked. Eateries are good quality plentiful and not crowded. The only minus was immigration line on arrival. First time I was out of the terminal within 15 minutes after flight next time I queued for 35 minutes or so. Bags are always waiting on the belt.,9.0
858,Flew into T5 on March 9th 2012 and spent nearly 2 hours at passport control. They had only 2 people in the Non-EU Non-UK line. At one point around 2pm both employees just got up and left (coffee break)? For the next 15 mins we all stood in horror as there was nobody! The crowd of people began yelling and pleading for somebody to return. I've honestly never seen such a mis-managed airport passport control in my life! Whoever manages the Customs at Heathrow is seriously damaging perception of Heathrow BA and London.,2.0
859,"Flew into Terminal 5 Jan 2012. Waited in the Immigration queue for 1.5 hours! The UK passport holders booths had already processed everyone in the UK line and were sitting around talking while non-UK passport holders area had only two manned booths. Why some supervisor couldn't move workers to the Non-UK side is beyond me. After an hour an Australian man started screaming to see a supervisor. When that supervisor came over to the line she told him in no uncertain terms that they only had two officers. This ""problem"" has serious repercussions - business is being affected it makes me think twice about spending my tourist dollar in a country that apparently just doesn't care.",2.0
860,Sunday evening departure T1. The usual huge queues at bmi/Lufthansa check-in desks and the area is still uncomfortably overheated/under ventilated. 10 minutes to clear security. However things improve rapidly after security with everything in working order clean and tidy and conditions are much more comfortable even with large numbers of pax. Flight departed on time and arrived early. Still good airside but continues to leave a lot to be desired landside.,6.0
861,Departure on morning of 23 Feb from T3 - very good selection of shops both land and airside; helpful to have Travelex pick-up landside right next to the security lanes. Security line was relatively long but was processed quick quickly although not within the supposed 5 minute target. T3 always seems very busy in the central terminal area and still appears to be handling too many passengers for its size. Terminal seemed clean but a bit dated in places. Long walk to gate.,7.0
862,Arrived at Terminal 3 from Bangkok. When we got to the immigration hall it was an absolute nightmare. Even with fast track passes we queued over an hour to pass through immigration - a lovely holiday was spoilt by this unnecessary delay. The borders agency need to have more staff on at the terminals. What's going to happen later this year when it's the Olympic games - it will be a total farce. If I were an overseas tourist I would avoid Heathrow airport at all costs.,6.0
863,"Arrived at T5 on a Wednesday morning in Feb and it took over 2 hours to be processed by immigration agents! There were only 3 wickets open we watched 5 underworked agents several of them idle in the EU/UK passport section. None of them we diverted to the ""All Other Passports"" sections and no new agents were put on duty. The many personnel assigned to manage the lines spent their time handing out complaint forms and trying to calm frustrated passengers. It would be better to simply assign more people to processing incoming travellers.",1.0
864,T5 has great potential to be world-class but does not deliver it due to poor planning. The whole transfer process needs to be rethought. There is too much waiting in line for the various boarding pass/passport procedures - more agents needed. Transfer security screening is the same nightmare it was in the old BA multi-terminal days. Many lines of passengers trying to merge then capacity controls on the escalator as there is a huge bottleneck at the top of it. Nothing good can be said of the screening area and staff though I feel sure they are grumpy and aggressive for the same reason the passengers are. It would not take a great deal to improve this but have seen little progress to date.,5.0
865,Good all round airport. I've mainly used T4 (international) which seems a bit cramped and there always seems to be minimal seating available. Fairly clean as you would expect from one of the worlds biggest airports but I didn't see many staff about and those I did were chatting to each other not fussed about travellers.,7.0
866,"Flew in/out of T5 at the weekend and its probably my worst experience to date of using T5. Luggage seemed to take forever to come off the plane - its a UK domestic flight so not exactly far to travel through the airport. Arrived at check-in area yesterday morning and in the ""north"" area there were 3 check-in desks open out of 15 - not on especially as it was extremely busy since it was the first day of the English mid-term holidays and the place was heaving! I sorely wished I hadn't decided to put my bag into the hold! Thankfully security was fairly quiet and was being kept moving by the BAA staff. As per usual the flight to ABZ was late. Plus points in that they did have the gate number up much earlier than normal so there wasn't the last minute dash to the gate although no explanation/announcement that there was going to be a delay!",6.0
867,After a very pleasant flight home I was disgusted to have to queue for over half an hour at border control this was my first visit to T5 .There was only two manned. Surely staff there must know when planes are arriving. It completely spoilt the end of my journey.,4.0
868,Bad treatment from ground personnel. They seem to be there by chance bored and annoyed by travellers. Not comfortable at all. Luggage check is too long compared to other airports.,3.0
869,Cramped buildings with lots of lost passengers with no one to help them. Dark interior probably to hide the problems. Security queues too long although security scanners are not being used - although Terminal 5 is ok as only British Airways uses it. Taxes to use LHR are far too high and compared with other main international competitors taxes are much lower giving LHR a disadvantage.,4.0
870,Terminal 3A dreadful first view of the UK. No fast track facility although airline had issued us with fast track tickets. Assistance booked but wheelchair only took me half way to baggage handling. Everywhere was scruffy. I flew in from Bangkok where the airport was clean well staffed and efficient. Cant we do better than this?,4.0
871,"I used T5 and T4 for arrival and departure. T5 was very good on departure with lots of eateries and places to sit and relax. However arrival was shockingly bad. I had to queue at immigration for 1hr 55 mins with only 2-3 desks manned. I don't believe that border control staff don't know flight schedule and are not prepared to see a couple of B747 arrive about 3 pm. Same happened couple months ago when I arrived on the same flight at the same time. Same experience: lots of staff to manage the queue and almost no one to process passengers. EU desks even when empty don't invite ""all other passports"" to ease congestion. Is LHR going to become a second CDG? At T4 immigration line was managed well with digital signage system.",5.0
872,I use LHR often as most international flights pass through this airport. However I would not use it if I have the chance. The queues at the 'All Other Passports' section are very long and I often have to spend more than one hour in the queues. The departure lounge at T3 is very crowded and shopping facilities are lacking. The only plus about Heathrow is that it is served by the London Underground which makes it convenient if there are no strikes or engineering works.,3.0
873,T5. The queuing system for arrivals (passport check to security with the escalator) is totally amateurish and unacceptable - it is much too cramped poorly designed and there are at least 3 waiting points. The amount of staff required to control passenger flow is above normal the security queues block passages to other queues because of lack of space. Seeing the amount of space the airport authorities devoted to shopping versus passenger security clearly you consider passengers cash cows.,2.0
874,Arrived at T4 from Tokyo via Moscow. Our flight landed around 20.00 earlier than scheduled but a long walk to immigration. At immigration there was a long queue for non-European section. More than 10 gates were open but suddenly all gates except 2 or 3 closed at 21.00 as officers finished their shift even with hundreds people queuing still. We were so angry. After queuing 1.5 hrs I managed to go through immigration. Also Heathrow does not offer free WiFi while many Asian airports do.,5.0
875,Flew in to T1 and departed from there. If you fly LX it takes at least 20 mins to get to immigration and the walk seems to go on forever. Immigration is usually quick and if you have a biometric passport you can use the e-gates. Baggage claim is functional and seems efficient enough. The good thing is that the tube runs frequently from T1 but again the walk is rather long in comparison to T5. Check-in efficient but not friendly. Departure is fine but security can take quite long at times. Airside there are some shops and overall it is quite good. However the walk to the gates are again endless. I think T5 is still better.,6.0
876,Sunday evening flight T1 to MAN. 10 minute queue at check-in but staff friendly polite and apologetic for the delay which is unusual. No queue at security who were also unusually friendly and polite. Flight over 1.5 hours late due to delays earlier in the day. Facilities are still very good airside.,6.0
877,HKG afternoon arrival at T3. Non-peak hour arrival meant no queue at passport control. However T3 did look a little aged and the rude immigration officer at passport control made a really bad impression to the airport and to the city. Evening AMS departure at T5. A brand new terminal with no queue for check in and security checks. Big and spacious terminal with plenty of shops to spend the time while waiting for flight.,5.0
878,I used Terminal 5 for the first time last week - and what a disappointment! The check-in area is spacious and I was through security in record time but the main departure area felt cramped and crowded. Yet again there are too many shops and too few places to eat - another shopping mall. If BA buys BMI's slots where are all the extra passengers going to go?,5.0
879,In the past 9 months I have used terminals 1 3 and 5. T5 is by far the best and despite its size it feels quite relaxed and human. I had no problem with queues except at immigration and even those were not too bad. The only downside appears to be that it can be a very long time between leaving the gate and taking off I think it was about 20 minutes for a 45 minute flight to Brussels. T1 is not too bad though it feels like a crowded shopping mall but there are quieter places to sit the waiting areas at the departure gates are rather depressing. Queues for security and immigration were both fairly lengthy. T3 for check-in and arrivals last week was quite good but once in the departure area it is an unpleasant environment: crowded with insufficient seating and no view. Security was efficient and with a chipped passport I got through immigration quickly. As a whole Heathrow feels what it is a mish-mash of parts that have been added over 50 years with no overall plan or identity and some parts very tired.,6.0
880,Used terminal 5 on a domestic flight to Glasgow. Check-in was pain free quick and efficient more than likely due to us using the fast track lane. Getting through security was a slow process due to the fact BA use the one security zone for both domestic and international flights which meant long lines of passengers and more stringent checks. Once past security terminal 5 has a lot to offer plenty of places to eat and drink and lots of shops. The only thing is how expensive everything is a lot of shops sell luxury goods and the sandwich shops are extortionate. I know BA is a more upmarket choice but a few cheaper options would be nice.,7.0
881,Arrived into LHR T1 on United Airlines from LAX. Flight arrived early very long walk from United gates to immigration. Immigration was very slow arrived around 1pm with only two immigration officers serving the EU passports which took nearly 40 minutes to clear. International passports not a lot better lots of empty desks that should be manned when passenger numbers get busy - there seemed to be more people grooming the lines as opposed to manning the desks. Baggage was ready to pick up once boarder control had been cleared.,3.0
882,I arrived at Terminal 4 on KLM things have improved dramatically. Arrival gate levels nicely lit and all the travelators work. Immigration has automated line management system and easy to understand voice announcement. Bag on the belt in 4 minutes. Refurbished arrivals hall clean toilets refreshed lighting improved taxi stand signage - I was off the airport 20 minutes after flight.,10.0
883,Flew to and from Terminal 1 in October. A much-improved terminal though still busy and some queuing at various points. On return a short but slow-moving passport and immigration queue and then a long wait for luggage even though we were nearly the last off the plane and had seen the luggage coming off whilst we were still in our seats!,9.0
884,T4 a good terminal with plenty of shops cafes some with runway views. Lots of signs telling you where to go. Security was good polite staff. On return baggage reclaim was slow nearly 1/2 hr wait. Good connections to underground etc.,6.0
885,T4 is okay facilities are limited and the design means a lot of walking. T1 was another matter - coming in from KUL I got through to the T1 Flight Connections Centre well enough but then got in the wrong queue for border control wasting several minutes because the signage did not indicate that it was only for journeys terminating at London - there was a separate queue for border control for connecting trips. This is also about yet another change of procedure by the Borders Agency. OTOH the security checks were quick.,6.0
886,Terminal 5 on a Sunday afternoon. It seemed really busy but bag drop time was a couple of minutes about 5 mins to get through Security then the underground train to B satellite. Plenty of shops and drink/food outlets. Boarded 30 mins ahead and left on time. We returned 2 weeks later around midday on the Sunday 10 min hold which appears to be the minimum likely. Used the auto immigration desk we scanned our own passports and were through in about 3 mins staff on hand should we have had a problem. Suitcases were on the carousel waiting for us. Getting the underground train from B satellite to the main terminal was a problem in that they automatic doors kept trying to close but people were forcing their way on the trains causing the doors to keep opening. However we were heading out of Heathrow on the Heathrow express to Paddington 20 mins after we arrived at the gate not bad for a fully loaded 747 from Seattle. So all in all a good experience of Terminal 5 at Heathrow.,10.0
887,First transit through Terminal 5 and it is a great building. If you get the chance then the BA Galleries Lounge is lovely. As with many airport terminals security is the weakest link the transit security area queues here were woeful and I thought it was a quiet time early afternoon on a Saturday. In T5 everything has to go in large trays to go through x-ray and unlike most other places that includes carry on bags. Many people do not travel often and so some patience should be offered to them when this is all new to them. I just saw rude and arrogant security staff barking at people time after time as we waited and watched.,4.0
888,"T3 Departure/Arrival Sept 2011 - JAL to Tokyo. Drop off is generally chaotic and overcrowded check-in areas are dark and dingy although JAL Business Class check-in never has queues. Security ""fast-track"" is anything but although it has improved recently. Airside you come through security into the duty free shop. Not into a shopping area but into the shop itself you have to fight your way through people stopping to look at goods in an area crowded with display stands. All the retail outlets/restaurants have long queues gate areas are small and crowded. Arriving back is no better - on two occasions this year I've arrived back to find the queue for passports going outside the immigration hall and back up the ramp towards the planes. Many people here have complained about the lines for non-EU passport holders but I can assure you it is not much better for EU passport holders - took me 40 minutes to get through on Sunday. Only good thing is that our bags had arrived by the time we got through but had all been piled into the open area next to the belt by staff to prevent the belt being overloaded so finding your bag was something of a challenge. On leaving the baggage hall the arrivals area is absolute chaos you can barely get through and the lifts cannot cope with the volume of passengers. This terminal simply cannot cope with the volume of passengers.",1.0
889,No free WiFi available and all the cafes and stores are located so that you can't see the tarmac. Looks a little dated as well. Service was smooth and efficient and no long queues. Good connections to London city centre as well.,3.0
890,My first T5 transfer experience which I could call acceptable and that was only because for some strange reason there were virtually no passengers at the usual peak 6.30 am time. I have always maintained that the transfer security area is woefully inadequate and this was the proof. An unusually pleasant experience for all the wrong reasons.,3.0
891,Terminal 3 while improved is still too small to cope with the volume of passengers. Maybe things will improve when they re-open T1 and T2 to full capacity. Still a very inadequate airport in terms of number of check-in desks space ambience and light. Plenty - maybe too much shopping.,3.0
892,T5 out to HK this weekend. Checked in online and through security quickly. They should give earlier warning about belts computers and pockets as some people are taken by surprise when getting to the x-ray. Restaurants although expensive are a great alternative to inflight catering. When you go to B or C gates the facilities are not so good.,5.0
893,Arrived T3. Used new e-passport gates but didn't work with new passport so had to use agent (about 50% did). About 1 hour to wait for bags to arrive. Air Canada arrival lounge good.,3.0
894,Used the airport back to Washington DC from London on United. Terminals are old and look tired. Substandard facilities and the walk to the United gate was long. Little to no facilities near the gates.,1.0
895,Arrival in to T5 was not bad although the line for border control took around 15min to clear. Once through it took another 15 min to get our bags which seemed a bit long. However after that we were on the tube in a few minutes and it is far better than T1 T2 T3 which takes a long time to walk to the tube station. Airport is very modern and airy and gives a good impression. Departing we arrived with the tube again and the lift to the departure level is efficient you don't have to walk a lot with your baggage to reach check-in desks. Check-in was quick but the VAT refund did take a while as they only staffed the desks with 2 people. Security was quick and the shopping choices are great. Boarding was on time and it's great to leave from terminal 5A.,5.0
896,I used it for arrival and departure 2 weeks ago. T5 both ways. I liked the new C gates concourse and the train system that seems to be efficient despite quite slow. Food and duty free selection is impressive. On departure no queues anywhere. On arrival it was a long immigration line for non-eu passport holders. Despite many wide bodies landing at the same time they only staffed 12 positions. As a result I had 1hr 15mins wait to reach border control. After immigration I picked up my bag (had already been on the belt) and got bus to the city. Overall processing time on arrival was around 1hr 35 mins. They must know their flight schedule and should expect that some 300 non-EU citizens (in our case Japanese) arrive at the same time every day and there is a need to staff desks appropriately.,4.0
897,For such a large airport it was easy to get around with clear and direct signage. Terminal 5 clean and modern. I wish that they use trains instead of buses to link to each terminal as the bus seems to take a while. Terminal 3 was modern with pleasant service. The food court had lot's of choices many shops around the airport. Easy currency exchange from pounds to euros around stores. It's a great airport to have a layover with plenty to do while you wait.,5.0
898,Used Heathrow T5 a couple of weeks ago for domestic flights fast check in good security - noticed the family lane with cartoons on the actual scanner good idea to calm children. Excellent departures area. all in all impressed.,5.0
899,Terminal Five. When we departed Heathrow everything worked well and efficiently until we found that we had to be bussed to the aircraft. On our return however the new satellite C terminal had opened and be were able to disembark along a jetty. Short monorail ride into the main terminal and through immigration in a couple of minutes. Bags just being loaded onto the carousel so disembarked processed and baggage collected in under 30 mins. Well done Heathrow and BA.,5.0
900,T5 during a peak travelling period. Queue for bag drop was satisfactory - check-in staff efficient. No queue for security and went through with no problems. Not the friendliest of staff but wasn't expecting much. Great view of the runway and flights taking off made the wait to board quite pleasant. Facilities in the terminal were adequate.,5.0
901,Used Heathrow for domestic flights twice in the last week. Terminal Five clean bright and airy but seemed to be struggling with the number of passengers. Long wait at bag drops stressed out check-in staff long queues at security and food outlets very busy/crowded. Lack of seating at gate - myself and many other passengers were left standing for a long time as the flight was delayed. Great range of shops but a long walk down to A19/A20 if you are in a hurry! Both flights were delayed a considerable amount of time once boarded due to runway congestion - delighted to hear that mixed mode is going to be used on an introductory basis. Used T1 on 7 August and security queue was much shorter - was through in a few minutes and the terminal seemed far less chaotic. Heathrow is improving but is inconsistent.,4.0
902,I used T5 at LHR on a recent trip to New York. Check in was swift although Fast Track could have been quicker. Lounge facilities were excellent and there is a wide choice of shopping and dining facilities. Adequate seating at the gates and the transit system is really efficient.,5.0
903,Horrible queuing system. They need more staff at the UKBA counter. I had a wait of 3.5hrs to pass through immigration in a very hot and humid hall. Inefficient and rude.,2.0
904,Arrived at T4 on an Etihad flight from Abu Dhabi in the evening. The queue at Border Control was very long and only less than 10 counters out of 30+ available counters were manned. It took me 2 hrs to get through Border Control (Foreign Passport Section) and I missed my ground connection to my final destination.,1.0
905,Used T3. long line for security little free seating in main departures area due to a small refit. Long walk to plane food outlets very expensive. On arrival better shorter walk no passport control line to speak of and bags coming up when arrived at the belt. Trolleys hard to find in baggage area.,3.0
906,Running frantically to catch a connecting flight on the other side of the airport I was stopped at the security checkpoint and searched. They got into my bag and took out a ziplock bag of medicine that I had for my high blood pressure. The medicine was in liquid form and was accompanied by a doctor's prescription. The airport security took it away and said it was not permitted on the plane. They said that it would be sent to me and gave me a ticket receipt. When I went online it turned out they wanted me to pay $70 to send the medicine from England to Latvia. A complete rip-off. So now I won't have my medicine the entire time I'm in Latvia and will have to get more only when I am back in the States.,1.0
907,Terminal 4 is new and very efficient. Through customs security and detax (claiming back 20% VAT for tourists) in 20 mins! You can't do better than that! But Wifi is not free and the paid services are slow and expensive at 9.95 pounds a session should not be called broadband because they are not broadband. Maybe 128k speed. But signage is good airport is clean staff are good too. Terminal 3 I landed at T3 and had connecting flights at T3 very efficient. I had 2 hrs 10 mins to do a connecting flight and I was panicking I would miss my flight. But nothing to worry. Got off the plane my Virgin Atlantic flight through customs collected my luggage checked through my British Airways flight to a European destination pass security in 30 mins! American airports can learn from this. Last time I was connecting in LAX-JFK and it took 2.5 hrs.,5.0
908,You really have to consider LHR as 4 separate airports according to which terminal you use. Arrival from JFK at T5; and absolute joy. Clean bright terminal with plenty of space and well-laid out. UK border control inwards a breeze through the EU passports line (queued for less than 5 mins after 0700 arrival on a Sat) and baggage already waiting at carousel. Reached the big bright arrivals hall in less than 30 mins after touchdown. At an airport like LHR such a feat is impressive. Whether departing or arriving T5 is always a pleasure. Easy transfer to T3 with the LHR express but T3 itself is another story. It is cramped and all thoroughfares are jammed with throngs of pax mostly with overloaded baggage trollies. Seating is an option only if you buy something at one of the food outlets. Queuing at security is efficient thanks to the staff who constantly keep watch and regularly re-distribute the queue. I never sit in the central seating area/food court. Too much like a shopping mall and always unpleasantly overcrowded and noisy. I always go through late enough to have my gate number posted on the FID's and head straight there and it's usually fairly painless. Queues security etc. are all fairly tedious I agree but considering that LHR is the world's busiest airport it performs well. If planned around realistic transfer times a transit through LHR can be painless.,4.0
909,Make sure you leave enough room if you are connecting here especially T5. I had a 4 hr layoff for an onboard connecting international flight. Got off the plane (at another terminal I assume) took the elevator down to the subway station (train every 5 mins) and onto T5. Security took forever. The airport is designed nicely with standard seats and some comfy couches (good for a quick nap if you can get one for yourself). Decent amount of shopping and food available. Well signed and easy to find your way.,4.0
910,Used terminal 3 5 times within 2 weeks. It's pretty awful by world standards don’t really care though that the distances between transport services are long or that shopping is really basic or that it is really crowded I care like most others how long it takes to get through customs and immigration on arrival. What a contrast after arriving on a Friday morning from Australia I was through in no time at all. Come one week later on a Sunday night transferring through London for one night arriving from Madrid and we spent longer in the queue to get into the customs hall than the flight time itself! No security issue just pure volume of numbers. Strongly recommend if you are an elderly traveller you request airline wheelchair assistance if using this airport more than 2 hours on your feet after a long flight is not a pleasant welcome. Hopefully when terminal 2 re-opens this will take some pressure off but for now this is a terminal that should be avoided at all costs!,2.0
911,I don't go to the airport to eat or shop - I just want it to be smooth and efficient and I am still not sure that T5 fits the bill yet. The transit process can be very painful early in the morning and even when slow around 5pm the security proved to be tedious compared with Asian airports of a similar size - the system and space allowed for it is not adequate for the volume. One huge improvement is the addition of a Fast Track boarding lane at all the domestic/shorthaul gates for Executive Club Silver and Gold members.,3.0
912,I think this is a nice airport check-in very nice and also very fast. Large variety of restaurants and cafes and also has a spacious terminal. Very Very clean terminal.,5.0
913,Flew BA to Nice from T5. Again excellent airport not too busy (despite a lack of staff at BA luggage drop and certainly not helpful when some passengers simply ignored rules for luggage allowance and ended up arguing with the staff). Same situation in the security control - the staff were friendly enough but there were a few naive passengers who thought it was too much trouble to take off their jacket or insist they wanted to carry their own drink onto the plane. Apart from this the process was smooth. As usual once you are through the security T5 is a fantastic place. We had a meal at Wagamama - a very spacious restaurant very clean although the staff were grumpy and not efficient. The flight was delayed by 1 hour but at this airport you can always find somewhere to eat/drink or just do window shopping. It remains one of my favorite European airport terminals.,4.0
914,I flew out of Heathrow Terminal 3 on 27 May and back through T3 arrivals on 12 June. This terminal seems to be coping much better since the reallocation of some airlines to other terminals (notably T4). Good range of shops and restaurants. I don't agree with previous comments that all of the places to eat are expensive (Boots Eat Starbucks and Wetherspoons are all relatively cheap the compromise is more on quality than price). The main problems I encountered were very long walks to the gate - arguably unavoidable at Heathrow very long immigration queues long security queues (I was not processed in less than 5 minutes as Heathrow claim most people are) and the passages leading from arrivals to underground station were very drab.,4.0
915,LHR-YYZ -Connected through Heathrow on my way home to Toronto. Needed wheelchair assistance and had to wait over an hour for someone to finally show up and almost missed my flight terrible service. If you need wheel chair assistance at this airport don't expect much.,2.0
916,Terminal 3 an extended overcrowded waiting room surrounded by overpriced shops. Food prices much higher airside than landside. Still do not have to pay for Plastic Bags at security yet.,3.0
917,Couldn't really complain about T5 apart from some very long walks. Good range of facilities and easy access from the train. Some of the staff at the retail outlets need some proper training I was told rudely to get shifted from the seating near EAT as it would be closing in 5 minutes (this was at 9pm). If the airport is open then so should the outlets. On return passport control was quick and baggage delivery was prompt. Less than an hour after arrival I was in the bus to Gatwick and on the M25.,4.0
918,T5 is great with all possible facilities quick passport control and efficient security control. Even for a long transfer there is hardly a moment to get bored of watching other people or planes arriving and departing. Seating plenty and bathrooms are clean. For Airport standards I think the prices of the restaurants shops and cafe's are reasonable. This is one of the better airports in Europe.,5.0
919,London Heathrow Terminal 4. For my departure the terminal was working well check-in was very quick boarding pass check queues were handled fast and security took only minutes. It was nice to see them handing out free plastic liquids bags for those who did not have one (other airports now charge very high prices for cheap plastic bags). Airside there was plenty of room to sit down and the appearance of charging stations for electrical items is welcome. Fresh drinking water is readily available near the toilets (unlike Gatwick North where it is not). My return arrival experience was extraordinarily efficient and landing to landside time with luggage was 30 minutes.,5.0
920,T1 is still a good place to fly from. It is worth noting that there is an separate entrance to security from the BMI area which is useful when the main entrance is busy. I flew Aer Lingus and their flights depart from gates 77 - 90. This is effectively one long corridor and when there are flights disembarking security doors shut this corridor so be careful if you are planning a trip to the loo - you could miss your flight!,5.0
921,T5 domestic to international was fast and smooth with 1 small security check to reach the main terminal area. Airside has plenty of eateries to suit most tastes & pockets with prices slightly higher than in the landside shops. Everything feels modern and clean with huge windows to watch the aircraft. I imagine that in summer it could get very warm with more passengers crowding into the building but there were plenty of service personnel on hand to maintain cleanliness and assist any lost passengers. Each of the departure gate areas B & C are self contained areas with small shops and toilets. International to domestic took a lot longer and we had to wait for a much longer period to get back into the terminal building. Out of all the terminals at Heathrow this feels the most comfortable and customer friendly and it makes me more inclined to use British Airways because of this terminal.,4.0
922,Airport is to big. If you have to travel between several terminals. In general the people working on the airport are friendly and helpful however security people in terminal 4 not helpful.,4.0
923,T5. Teething problems a thing of the past and everything now seems to work smoothly. On the outward journey we stopped off and registered for iris recognition; third time lucky as the office seems to be closed more often than not. (tucked away just after Security at the south end). The machine took about 20 + attempts before it got a satisfactory record of my iris. Overall possibly not worth the hassle unless you regularly travel through the few UK airports that use it. Coming back we ended up outside the yet-to-be opened C Building so had to be bussed to the main terminal. Hold baggage was on the carousel by the time we got there. Apart from that overall a very good experience.,5.0
924,T4 Quick and efficient service at check-in security and then boarding. T4 has an abundance of shopping facilities and is large and spacious. Check-in had minimal queues that processed quickly as did the security queues. Boarding took a little longer but wasn't to long. On arrival baggage reclaim took a long time - at least 30mins this was annoying after a 10 hour flight! Customs and Immigration was busy but queues were processed fast and efficiently with a maximum wait of about 10mins. The airport information desk were fantastic in helping out with any queries.,5.0
925,Terminal 5 - satisfactory if not great. Passport queue was immense. I have travelled through Heathrow many times and seldom seen it this long. Waited nearly 40 minutes for someone to glance at my passport. I'm aware that infrastructure will be strained during Bank Holidays peak travel periods but UK Border Agency must be aware of predicted passenger numbers and should cater accordingly. Terminal clean and bright good connections to Heathrow Express and tube in arrivals.,4.0
926,I rarely use T4 but I used it recently and find it much more pleasurable than a T3 it seems more open and less crowded. We ate at one of the restaurants that provided a decent breakfast. However buying a sandwich to take on board was limited to Starbucks and Costa. A Pret or Eat would have been most welcome. On arrival the lines for immigration were long but processed fairly quickly.,4.0
927,Flew in and out of terminal three. Not the prettiest terminal in the world but it works. Good signage on arrival to the underground. Fast check in with Qantas on departure and security was a breeze with professional and friendly staff. There are plenty of shops and seating to keep you occupied but I chose to use the Servisair lounge. Good value at £18 with drinks snacks and wifi included plus a good view of the runway. Boarding the A380 was fast and efficient. Heathrow can be a bit of a challenge but I couldn't fault it on this trip.,5.0
928,Flew out of Heathrow to Sydney. Found Terminal 3 to be really good - we arrived very late - only 10 minutes before our check-in closed and still managed to get through all the security procedures before the boarding commenced. The concourse outside terminal 3 is especially attractive and inviting and has been well thought out.,5.0
929,Terminal 4 and 5 having been newly refurbished are extremely nice wide open spaces very short and quick queues and a nice overall experience.,4.0
930,Terminal 3. Check in was OK and getting through security was relatively fast - about 15 minutes considering the amount of people (1100 in the morning) trying to get through. Good range of shops once into departures and reasonable prices. On our return at 2120 getting through passport control diabolical. 2 desks open for UK/EU passport holders and took 45 minutes to get through even with 8 desks open eventually. Expect a long walk from the aircraft to get to this area anyway.,3.0
931,Terminal 4 - this terminal is a little isolated compared to the rest of Heathrow - and getting a hotel room close by overnight before our flight was difficult. But T4 itself was pleasant clean and efficient. We had no delay and the flight got away on-time. Security queues were substantial but staff were processing fast - so we queued for about 10-15mins not to bad! On return baggage reclaim for slow to start we waited at for about 10-15mins for the bags to appear.,4.0
932,T5 is a class act - well designed and very customer friendly. I travelled with hand baggage only and the security assistant was very good at sorting out my toleteries and even packed the bag for me!,5.0
933,Terminal 5 swift BA checkin and dismally slow and disorganised BAA security check even in a priority line. When will BAA sort this out? T5B lounge was fine. Coming back aircraft landed at T5C so bus to T5 main. Most bags waiting when I got through security but my skis were not. Even so on the tube within an hour of touch down.,3.0
934,T1 on my way to Ireland. Travellers to UK and Ireland destinations beware: once you go through security food and drink options become very scarce indeed.,4.0
935,Departed from T1 check in was in zone K there is a dedicated security area which is very handy took no time to get through. T1 seems spacious and quiet compared to T3 and I prefer its eating choices than the latter.,5.0
936,"As long as you stay in T5 LHR is okay. I transit throgh T5 many times a year to and from BRU to and from the US Asia the Middle-East BA lounges are roomy well catered and the terminal is very airy and well lit. Only drawdowns are the fact that you cannot access the lounges from check-in level : must go down first than back up again and much room for improvement as for the timing of the gate announcements especially when your flight is leaving from a ""satellite"".",5.0
937,The newly refitted Heathrow T4 is an amazing transformation from the dreadful old one. As a SkyTeam Elite plus member check in was timely and pleasant space is improved the shops and food selections are varied and SkyTeam lounge is the much better than the ones you see in other airports. Security is still a nightmare though despite improvements in the queuing methods and on arrival the luggage area hasn't been refurbished so it still looks nasty. Queuing on arrival if you are not lucky (meaning arriving at the same time as a couple other flights) you might be in there for over an hour. Overall great new departure side need loads of work on the arrivals one.,4.0
938,Disgusting service weekend of 18th/19th December. Very badly organised both for the weather conditions (despite boasting how well prepared they were!) and how they took care of their customers in the subsequent confusion. BAA staff should be ashamed of themselves both as a corporate and as individuals.,1.0
939,Terminal 3 and Terminal 5 in December 2010. Transiting was fair from Terminal 3 to Terminal 5. T5 was huge facilities not that well and building layout horrible. Return flight through Terminal 3 waiting time was fair due to snow. Facilities not as good. Very clean though.,3.0
940,Great airport! Had a great time passing a four hour layover in Terminal 1 and then again Terminal 3 on the way back. (As happy as we could be considering a death in the family) everything was very efficient very clean and actually pretty reasonably priced! The only thing I would suggest is that at security if you are a woman and you 'beep' through the metal scanner and they have a female officer pat you down I would suggest that there be a little area aside where the women can be checked. They do this in other airports and I find that it's much more comfortable. Just a little curtained area just right there would do. Something to think about.,5.0
941,It was hard to fault Terminal 5 on this arrival. From plane to transit to arrival hall was completely painless. IRIS worked as advertised and there were no immigration lines anyway. Baggage arrived almost immediately. A two minute walk to the short term car park reunited us with our car which had been driven for only 2 miles in our absence. T5 has settled in well.,4.0
942,Over the past couple of months I've had to use Heathrow a number of times - used to hate Heathrow but what a joy Terminal 5 is. Hardly any queuing lots of open space and great views of the runways.,5.0
943,There was little to say about Heathrow on our latest departure to Los Angeles. The valet parking staff were charmless and weary. BAA do themselves no favours by taking many details on booking which they do not pass on in the form of complete documentation for ones arrival. Thus information which has already been given has to be repeated. Security was a little more pleasant than usual. They know in their hearts that the end is coming for some of the more ridiculous processes. Queues were not long.,4.0
944,Last trip through T5 was better than previous visits but below what should be expected from a brand new facility. Had to wait for steps then repeated standing in line for people to look at boarding passes then for passport control. This time security was better and Fast Track was fast for the first time. The whole thing looks cobbled together and is not a good example of British organization.,3.0
945,Flew from LHR Terminal 3 late October on flight to Madrid. Checked in within 5 minutes of arriving and went straight through to the well equipped airside with plenty of good shops and eateries to entertain. Security queues minimal and staff were generally friendly too.,5.0
946,I travelled through Terminal 5 on a BA domestic flight in the early morning and experienced greatly improved standards. The security process is quick and previous rudeness of the staff seems to have gone. There are excellent shopping facilities and no bussing to the gates which was often the case at TN1. On the way back the flight arrived before time and the bags were available in 10 minutes. No complaints at all.,5.0
947,Having checked-in online the day before our flight to Vienna it was a simple painless task to go to the bag drop then through immigration and security. Considering it was peak time on a Thursday morning we would have expected the pre-boarding processes to have been a lot slower. Security and immigration fully staffed by pleasant people. Good options airside at Terminal One for food and shopping. The return ten days later was equally slick. Long walk from the gate to baggage reclaim but Immigration took a matter of seconds and we were on our way within 40 minutes of landing.,5.0
948,"Arrived from MAD on BA at terminal 3 last month. Bus transfer not a pleasant experience but at least as a BA branded operation they seem to try to keep it efficient. Bit of a trek around a typically maze-like run of Heathrow stairs slopes and corridors to get to passport control where I was confronted with thousands people waiting in long lines at a dozen or more desks - and thankfully two lonely desks completely deserted for EU arrivals. Through in 10 seconds! Luggage turned up fairly speedily too - although an ""arrival time"" estimate on the monitors would be a handy addition. Not too bad then but airbridges not buses for BA flights would be very welcome.",3.0
949,Our first visit to Heathrow Terminal 5. Departed and arrived within 12 days this month. Departure no queues used fast bag drop no issues no queues at Security (about 9.30am on a Sunday) Used BA exec lounge good range of snacks and drinks available also free wi-fi. On our arrival back into Heathrow we had to disembark by stairs and into buses how sad that London is only place this seems to happen! Then went in Border Control and the room was absolutely packed (about 2045hrs on Thursday) having said that the queue we were in moved quite quickly and we soon got to our luggage retrieval area to find out suitcases some of the first out - we were out of the airport on our Hoppa bus 30 mins after landing so whilst not perfect we were pleased with that.,4.0
950,Heathrow has had something of a major transformation over the past few years. 5 years ago you could expect long queues art check-in longer queues at security more long queues at immigration and extensive waits for your baggage - if it turned up at all. The terminals were drab and outdated - threadbare grey carpets cheap red plastic old fashioned information screens. In my experience this isn't the picture anymore. Check-in is mainly down to the airlines but certainly for BA the queuing has all but gone for United - not so much. Security never seems to take more than 5 to 10 minutes - same for immigration. As for baggage the last couple of times - it's beat me to the carousel and the time before that it was only a few minutes. The terminals themselves have been updated and Terminals 1 and 4 are now bright clean and airy. Terminal 3 is brighter but still feels a bit cramped. Terminal 5 which is new is excellent. I'm sure people still occasionally still have bad experiences and I've never changed flights there. But for me Heathrow is no longer somewhere I try to avoid.,5.0
951,I've never really needed to use Heathrow with Emirates flying from my local airport of Newcastle. From what I could remember Heathrow was always a bit of a nightmare very dull no real light - but I have to say T5 is fantastic plenty of space - nice toilets hardly any queuing great views of the runways. All round a pleasure.,5.0
952,Terminal 5 to Manchester on a Saturday afternoon. No queue at boarding pass check and security quite friendly even when camera couldn't take my picture for the domestic security procedures. After a few minutes a less helpful colleague took the photo and I passed into security area - 15 mins in the queue but gate was close by and seated onboard with doors closed before departure time.,4.0
953,Second time through T5 this time for a European flight and it is still a breeze. Had breakfast at Plane Food expensive but excellent. Departed from A gates plenty of room. On return bags on carousel as usual.,5.0
954,Taking a group thru terminal 4 today. It was so easy. It is so nice to be able to find your way around with all the signage. I found this building to be clean neat and easy to get around with a large group of travelers. Can't wait for all skyteam members to be moved to this terminal. Checking in was very fast. Employees where friendly and very helpful.,5.0
955,Arrival at T4. Flight landed 20.25. A long wait (nearly 30 minutes) to cross the runway to reach the stand at T4. On stand at 21.00 - but baggage not on the carousel until 22.15. A dismal performance.,1.0
956,Used both T3 and T5. Flight connections worked as it should and I was pleasantly surprised thinking it would be harder than it was. T3 I don't particularly like with it's lack of daylight however it can't be helped. Gate area was freezing cold which was disappointing. T5 I really like apart from the flight connections area. Being shouted at by staff who obviously don't like working there herding you up the escalator to security. When you reach the top of the escalator it is crowded and you have to force your way off the escalator. This area is really badly designed and lets the terminal down. Plenty to keep you occupied even on a long connections like mine of 5 hours. Impressed with T5 so-so about T3.,4.0
957,Terminal 3 arrivals pretty awful Departures pretty good. Everything about the arrivals level looked old immigration hall is a mess. The queue was quite long for non UK/EU citizens - more empty desks than occupied ones arrivals hall wasn't much better. Departing from Terminal 3 was a pleasant experience. SIA uses check-in area A which is much more open than other check-in areas. Departures lounge had a good range of shops and cafes perfectly pleasant waiting here - a great improvement on the last time I had been through T3 ten years ago.,4.0
958,Have used T3 for four decades during which improvements have generally not made things better. The Duty Free area is way too large and the prices not at all that competitive: area should be halved for more comfort and seating places. Distances to the gates are unacceptable. A miserable places for arrivals; departures is much better but still not good.,3.0
959,I have travelled through several terminals 1/3/4 and find them all very different. Terminal 4 is out of the way south side of the runways but is modern and clean. Not a lot of restaurants inside a lot of shopping for that last minute duty free item however. Terminal 1 is old but once terminal 2 is redone it is expected to be replaced. Overall it is crowded but seems to be well taken care of. Terminal 3 is huge - if you have a flight from one of the ends of the long concourses take comfortable shoes! I think most North American and Asian carriers are based in terminal three so mornings are busy read maps to not get lost which is easy to do in this terminal. London Heathrow is a great airport a lot of things to buy or if you like plane watching all terminals offer a view of airlines from all around the World. It feels a lot closer to London than Gatwick but it can be a bit more expensive to get into Central London from Heathrow.,5.0
960,Terminal 1 international arrival midday on a Sunday. Bussing to the terminal was prompt although there was a long walk to immigration. Queues long for both EU and other passport holders but he EU side moved quite fast. Between Immigration and Baggage there was only one small toilet which led to queues outside. Baggage worked well and the total time between the wheels touching the ground and leaving the airport with two bags was 1 hour.,4.0
961,Terminal 5. I was amazed how good this terminal was (first time user). We had an early flight and ate breakfast at the Gordon Ramsey Plane Food restaurant. Excellent food and service plus it was peaceful compared to the rest of the terminal eateries. We used the bag drop service excellent and rapid service. Departure lounge good adequate seating and excellent range of shops. Good seating at gates. On return flight very smooth walk through UK entry checks and our bags came rapidly to carousel. Signs to T5 long stay car park (and other transportation) very good.,5.0
962,Terminal 5. Maybe we were lucky due to flying out during the BA strike but there were no queues anywhere and the place was spotless. Decent choice of shops and eateries. So nice and light compared to the other enclosed stuffy terminals. On the way back we were disembarked at terminal B so had to get the shuttle train to the main terminal. We were out within 30 minutes of landing.,5.0
963,Departed from T3 early morning (Air Canada) and arrived back early morning. I frequently use T1 and T5 and have very positive opinions on the arrival experience - generally very fast and smooth with the exception of T5 when BA flights can't find a gate to park. T3 has improved significantly. The building is still very old and the departure hall is still like a third world airport. However it is not as crowded as it used to be not a long queue in front of security. Some annoying passengers questioned why they had to take off their accessories water etc but you encounter those kind of passengers everywhere in the world. After security there are plenty of shopping. Heathrow is probably the best place for airport shopping partly due to the exchange rate. Arrival was a good experience. Its a long walk as usual but for EU/UK passport holder or those using Iris scan there was no queue at all. You whip through immigration in a second. Then the luggage came out before I even arrived at the belt.,4.0
964,T5 - Horrific transfer took 1h15 to get from the aircraft and through security impatient staff chaos at the top of the escalator and security staff unsure of where Geneva was. However domestic transfer did not involve passport or security checks so no issues.,2.0
965,There is a huge difference according to which terminal you use. We used T3 and T4. T3 is very boring looks like it was built in the 1970's and not well maintained whereas T4 was a fine experience with good shopping possibilities. I wonder why there are no carts available airside - it is not good for shopping or the passengers which carries handbaggage.,3.0
966,I have come through Heathrow a few times now for domestic flights between London and Belfast. I've had no problem or mishaps and found the airport as I would wish to. Although the walking distance is quite long the routes are always well signposted and it is easy to get to where I need to be. If you have any mobility issues then assistance might well be advised to help you cover the potentially large distances involved with getting around such a huge airport. The shops and cafes that are available are also very good (although a little pricey).,5.0
967,Much as I dislike BA and have avoided them for years I had no choice for a recent trip. T5 is almost enough reason to resume travelling with BA. It's light and airy no queues employees who clearly enjoy working in such a lovely environment and a quick and easy transition from arrival to departure. An example for others to follow. A pity that the cabin crew on the BA flight were surly and haughty which detracted from the initial good experience of T5. The ratings I have given refer to T5 not to Heathrow in general.,5.0
968,T5 is generally a great experience. Slightly odd desk staffing policy at check-in and it can sometimes be an issue knowing where to go - BA staff on foot around desks are not very pro- active in moving people to empty desks. Anyway security has always been quick for me and staff courteous. Loads of shops/places to eat but still never feels crowded and noisy even at peak times. Tonnes of natural light. In all compared to previous offerings in T4 (or the dreaded T3) this is a real haven for Heathrow!,4.0
969,Terminal 3 has had a face lift but it's superficial improvement. I don't like the design of T5 with gates in the waiting area. Outbound flight to Amsterdam on BA involved a bus trip to the plane surprising requirement given the money spent on building a new terminal. Return to LHR from AMS was nothing short of a joke. Arrived in heavy rain airbridge at assigned gate wouldn't work because of the weather. A few U-turns around Heathrow later arrive at another gate. Airbridge makes it 2 feet from the plane and gives up - reason: rain. Have to wait for stairs to arrive so we can have a nice wet walk to the terminal. Time from landing to deplaning about the same as the flight itself.,2.0
970,Flew out of T1 to Munich: speedy check in using the self service terminal and quickly and efficiently handled bag drop. The 'queue' at security was just two people so no delays whatsoever. It definitely seems to be a better experience at Heathrow these days!,4.0
971,Travelled out of T5 for the third time in 6 months. I use the Valet car park so from dropping off your car it's easy to be airside inside 10 mins. The terminal is light airy and no feeling of claustrophobia shopping and food options are good. Easy transit to the B and C gates.,5.0
972,Flew T4 to Houston and back. Last previous use of T4 was in March 2008 and the overall experience is much improved. Arrival at the terminal and check-in is now far superior although this has resulted in airside looking somewhat grubby in comparison especially at the gates. Arrivals was very busy with almost no space in which to queue for immigration. Overall a big improvement.,4.0
973,T1 is great now for passengers. I flew to DUB on BMI and the flight left from Gate 84 - this is 20 minutes from clearing security and where Aer Lingus operate their flights. Something to note because of the layout if passengers are disembarking doors are shut so you cannot get through - be careful if you are in need of the loo!,4.0
974,In and out using T3 . Inbound transit was quick but surely the crowd controllers for non EU passport holders should be able to speak more languages. Outbound the waiting lounge was a disappointment. Having used T5 on a previous visit to UK the overall impression of T3 was not good.,3.0
975,Used T5 for the first time a much better experience than T3. There is plenty of natural light the toilets are clean and there are great views of the runways. The seating could be better lots of bench seats akin to T3 but there was some comfortable seats and lie down sofas by gates A7.,4.0
976,Flew in and out of both Terminal 3 and 5 respectively and found Terminal 3 to be the same as it was two years back. Immigration queues for the non-EU passports were amazingly long and I wonder why the BAA authorities cannot work something out and make the terminal more user friendly and immigration friendly ? Terminal 5 on the other hand was a breeze and the modern architecture gave it a nice feeling. The Self Check In Kiosk is such a brilliant idea and saves a lot of time and hassle.,3.0
977,Heathrow is a very impressive operation. The part I was in was a bit jaded and grubby and chaotic. But all in all my LHR experience was very positive. Loads of places to eat and shop. Some decent views of the apron from the boarding gates. What I like most about Heathrow is the sheer quantity off carriers operating on all manner of routes from that airport. It really is a world class hub. And I am sure that if I has been travelling through the new T5 - I would have found the upkeep of the facilities that more bit clean and aesthetic.,4.0
978,Used Terminal 4 to fly to and from Nairobi. It has improved a lot since the recent terminal changes and although busy it felt less crowded and claustrophobic than before. There were very few queues of any great length which helped make it less stressful too. Credit where it is due - this airport is improving.,4.0
979,Return trip from DUB to DEL transferring at Terminal One for Terminal Four. We found the transfer process relatively flawless even though our bags were not checked through. We took the elevator down to the train and found it quick and comfortable compared to many airports. This is a great improvement on previous connections made at LHR. Terminal Four lacks facilities airside not many eateries to choose from. Terminal One seemed better but the walk to the aircraft is way too long.,4.0
980,Terminal 3 quick check-in with Virgin Atlantic 2½ hours before departure. We were requested to go straight to airside then proceed to gate 2 hours before departure in order to allow for Gate security. However we were turned away from primary security being told passengers not allowed through until 2 hours before departure. Once allowed into security the queue was moderate. No gate listed until 1 hour before departure so had to endure the crowded shopping mall for an hour. BAA policy on using most of the space for shopping really does make using LHR terminals a depressingly uncomfortable experience.,2.0
981,First time using T5 - excellent. BA land agent was able to tell me all about the terminal and where to go when I got airside. BAA had staff on hand airside to assist travellers. Departed from B gates to USA. Security at gate was thorough but good humoured. Had to get a bus to the plane - so what. Bags waiting at carousel on return. Excellent first experience.,5.0
