0,"Visit Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport many times. It still is clean, spacious and the information given is very accurate. Staff are very friendly, prices of food and beverage are okay. There are many seats to sit on.",8.0
1,"They have decided to get rid of the smoking areas within the terminal and won't let you out of the terminal. Not ideal if you're a smoker after a long haul flight and with a 9 hour lay over. Writing this to distract myself because everything is annoying me right now. Never want to come back because of this bs, doesn't make sense for a major international hub",1.0
2,"Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport is okay for arrival. The procedure was quick. Immigration Visa on Arrival was quick and easy and there is a train link to Siam (Central Bangkok) via the Airport Transit via Phaya Thai Station. It's a different ballgame when you are departing. If you don't have boarding pass then you should arrive at the airport in plenty of time as check-in queue can be very slow. I never been in a airport with so many passport and boarding pass checks, they have so many staff. The issue is the strange terminal system and very long walks. It's designed that way so you can spend money on the hundreds of shops that line the concourse. There are few water dispensers. Not a place I want to be be for a long time.",5.0
3,"Made a transit from domestic to international With check-out and check-in of luggage. A cumbersome procedure (completely unnecessary) arrives two floors lower than the departure hall Which means that you have to transport your luggage a long way (not good). The staff at check in were very good and helpful. Business class has its own passport control and security check so there were no queues absolutely perfect. In its entirety, BKK worked well in addition to having to transport the luggage itself through the airport.",5.0
4,"Great airport but the closure of the smoking rooms is very frustrating, please open them again. Almost every time I am here I have to get a bus from the plan to the terminal when there are many free sky bridge. Why is this?",6.0
5,"Again a very poor experience of another Thailand Airport. Here you go: 1) All the washrooms are always being cleaned, and the cleaning staff are very rude and ask you to leave and go to a far away counter. 2) The Check in time taken for every passenger was very high, and all the counters very slow in pace to deal with people, irrespective the airport was empty. 3) Staff again do not understand English, very rude and uncooperative. 4) Gates too far even though, airport was empty. 5) Almost all food shops were closed, almost negligible options to eat / drink. 6) Drinking water has become a business now, with no display signs of airport provided drinking water and placing vending machines for water every where. 7) The most dirty airport I have ever come across, with huge piles of garbage bags all over every place from security to E6 gate which is good 15 ins walk. Very poor cleanliness.",4.0
6,"Very hot inside. I'm sure the aircon was an after thought. Sure there are aircon stations scattered throughout the terminal, most don't work or provide any comfort. Hey Suvarnabhumi Boss, try walking from one end to the other end with your luggage. You will need to shower all the sweat off your body and change your clothes. So if you all wonder why the person sitting next to you on the airplane smells of body odor, you can blame this airport. Suvarnabhumi Airport, a huge tent in a tropical climate. Air inside is hot and stale. And where is the seating for resting? What a waste of money building this horrible airport.",1.0
7,"Suvarnabhumi is big, very big. But even in this way, you don't have the space to walk. There are 3 airports in Bangkok. Why do the airlines use only this one? The problem is that the city is a hub, so it's almost impossible to travel by Southeast Asia without passing by this airport, or better, this crazy place (and the signs are useful, but there are too many people to see it).",5.0
8,"Very crowded airport. It was very difficult to find the check-in kiosk. I arrived at the airport by the skytrain, that was pretty good. Nonetheless, it was difficult to go to the level 4 with luggage. Staff hardly speak in English. Wifi service was really good.",5.0
9,"A very large airport. Very crowded. Very unorganized. Staffs are good though most of them cannot speak in English. There are many shops and food courts that are obviously very expensive. Airport shuttle bus with Don Muang is available for free from level 2. However, airport link train is available at level 1. Taxis are also available at level 2. Wifi is good.",6.0
10,"I have been using this airport since I started living in Bangkok. It is a huge airport. Immigration staff are good though they are bad at English. Very crowded airport. Everything is costly. It is good that this airport has airport link train and buses. Taxis are also available in meter, taxi fare is always high.",7.0
11,"After several trips through this airport (itself) and a host of other Asian airports (Incheon, HK, changi, Dubai, Beijing, Shanghai among others), I can positively state that this is one of the worst ""big"" airports. It is a huge mall strip like Orchard or Gangnam, it is not an airport. Sure, other airports have ""malls"" too but they are frequently interspersed with passenger seating areas, relaxation places, and facilities. This airport has very little of that. Not even sufficient travelators when you are tired. Try going from arrival in A to Gate D7 for your next flight when you have had little sleep. And the facilities like showers etc are sparse and only in expensive lounges, unlike other major airports. If you want those, you need to exit. Most staff are so laid back that no one knows anything. Toilets vary in quality of maintenance and some of them are kept in bad shape. The wi-fi is so-so. The only redeeming thing is the food selection but I am not there for food. There is nothing in this airport that says ""we are here to make your passage a little more comfortable."" If possible, avoid this airport as a connection point. Fact is that this airport has been like this for ages. (And after this last trip, I am determined never to pass through Suvarnabhumi unless I am traveling to Thailand, then I have no alternative).",2.0
12,"The staff have a lack of knowledge, lack of patience and are very impolite. They could not explain to passengers properly and when being questioned they just yell at passengers. The airport is always overcrowded and the facilities are very poor.",1.0
13,For the last couple of years travelling transit through the airport is totally going downhill. You arrive at one end of the airport example C gates and once you get through transit security which is nightmarish now and takes a very long time you find that your departure gate is on the other side of the airport and then you have to wait for a bus to take to to your plane. You get no time to sit and have a beer to help you recover from a 12 hour flight from London as you make the mad rush once through security to your endless walk to the other side of this airport. Don't like this airport now as you are not able to relax while going transit to your next flight. Horrendous crowded security checks at transit with very unhappy staff dealing with you. Heathrow and Ho Chi Minh airports are like heaven compared to Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport. I am seriously thinking about leaving Thai Airways too as their services are very bad too as compared to a few years ago. Its time for a change to another airline and airport and stay clear of Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport.,2.0

15,"I needed to take a passport photo and print a document for my visa on my next destination after immigration. I thought it wasn't easy to prepare all this after I had already passed immigration. So I called the information center and asked for help. First, their English was not good enough. They directed me to the wrong place. They just guided me to an information machine after 10 mins talking on the phone.  I explained my situation and asked have any way to go out immigration and come back under authority. She just kept saying no and kept cut my word again and again. So I gave up. It is an information center for traveler. Her behavior is totally untrained behavior and not professional at all. Of course, the way she spoke was not kind as we. After good memories of Bangkok, she ruined all feeling in Bangkok.",1.0
16,"Chaotic, slow and dirty. Security takes just a few minutes but passport control can take 1 hour +. Airport seems to be way over capacity. Try to fly to Bangkok's other airport if you can!",1.0
17,"Poorly organized immigration, long waiting at departure. Security control faster, leading to long wait back to escalator. Security staff limited help, unfriendly for Thailand.",4.0
18,"They should not claim to be an airport with a smile when they know that they cannot serve with a smile. It's a very long walking and unpleasant experience for flight transfer. Not only because of the long queue, but the way the officers treat passenger is impolite. I would think twice to have transit in Bangkok airport for long flight.",3.0
19,"Airport is over crowded, very hot and noisy. There is something wrong with the design of this airport. Walking too far to Gate E1. Immigration and body check is very slow and worst. I will try to avoid this airport as much as possible.",1.0
20,"The security check is present near the individual gate, the line is long and they remove any or all liquids. Despite there being a 100ml allowed limit, they still remove anything they find. I had a bottle of water with barely any water which they removed, plus an expensive cream (with which I regularly travelling internationally and domestically), which they removed despite me asking them not to when clearly there's a specified limit. The people do not understand English enough or perhaps it was that they don't respect you enough to even bother replying to you.",3.0
21,"I had a terrible experience completing a transfer at this airport with Thai Airways. I had a 2-hour window between flights and barely made it to my flight as the transfer process was so badly organised and extremely crowded. The queue reached back from the transfer gate the entire length of the travellator. Once through and allowed up the escalator we were herded into a small anteroom and made to do snake around for another 30 minutes with little air and many bodies in the room. Many people were extremely anxious as they believed they would miss the flight and started to push through. When I finally reached the security scanners, all sense of order was lost and I found myself in a crowd crush being pushed from behind. I almost fell. The security guard barked orders to keep a straight line but there were no processes put in place with ropes or barriers. When a passenger suggested that it was impossible to keep a straight line as there was no room. He retorted that if we complained or criticised he would turn-off the security screening belt and then we would all miss out flights. What sort of airport is this? They want you to suffer and miss your flights because you dare suggest that their system is not working. This attitude does not reflect well on Thailand, let alone their airport and airline. I would rather go the long way home via Dubai than experience this again.",1.0
22,"For transit you have to go through a security scan again. This means that any liquid will be taken away, which is a minor issue. I had to go through transit in the morning (coming from MUC, going to RGN). The queues were extreme and it took more than 90 minutes to get through! There is no fast track! Avoid!",3.0
23,Suvarnabhumi is probably the worst International Airport for business travel in SE Asia: there are few places to sit and work (except in the overpriced lounges) while the internet connectivity is appalling. There are few options for food and limited to no seating when available. Everything at the Airport seems to he aimed at forcing travellers into shops rather than supporting a convenient and comfortable flight. Passport checks on arrival and departure are not the worst in the region but could also be significantly improved.,5.0
24,I despise this airport. Way too much walking for an airport of it's size. And immigration is always like being at Walmart during a Black Friday sale with only 2 counters open. And now since they take your finger prints from both of your hands the process is even slower!,1.0
25,"We have travelled to Bangkok every year. Usually, the officer will direct us to the priority lane seeing seniors and kids we brought. This year, my husband and I have brought 2 kids (6 and 10) and 2 seniors (70 and 76) to Thailand for an 8 days (23rd to 30th Nov) vacation. Yesterday around 4pm, perhaps the officer on guard was not in a good mood, had a grim face on even when we approached the priority lane. We went over to enquire the officer can we go before we deemed we granted the use. After screening through the passport and she allowed only the seniors to enter but wanted our kids and us to go for the normal queue with her unfriendly/annoyed face. So I told my parents to follow us for the normal queue as it was our duty to make sure they were taken care of should something happened. Next, we saw a group of family, a pregnant lady with a handful of adults just entered without screening kind of puzzled me. I love this country and the friendliness of the people. This officer should have handled the case with friendliness especially being in service. They somehow dampened our mood after our 8 fun-filled days spent in the country.",5.0
26,"What a total mess this airport is. Always was anyway. But this time crossed all limits. Some idiot minister decided that there will not be a smoking area in the airport. After a 10 hour flight I am not allowed to smoke and still waiting more than 3 hours to smoke in Phnom Penh. WiFi slow, food (European prices), dirty! Shame on you!",1.0
27,"Tragedy of an airport! 1) No smoking places, after a long trip I got informed there is no place to smoke. 2) Prices too high, 18€ for two cups of coffee and two muffins. 3) Directions unclear, went to a section with tag foreign passports and got denied. There were only two ways to go, Thai passports and foreign. Denied because all had ""chinese passports"" stickers. After a while they led me thru, as they understood it was a mistake not letting thru. 4) Not clean. 5) Internet is a tragedy too, slow as hell. Never going through this airport again.",1.0
28,"After an 11 hour flight, there was no possibility to smoke a cigarette. I have to wait 2 hours more for connection flight. I will never use Thai Airways again to avoid such. Better fly with Singapore Airlines, they have also non smoking policies but you find place where you can smoke.",2.0
29,"I'm surprised that the airport declared non-smoking. Even Singapore who is quite against smokers has multiple smoking rooms in all its terminals. I'll avoid Bangkok airport in the future. If they do not know how to respect human rights, I'm not prepared to support them.",2.0
30,"Airport is uncomfortably hot, bathrooms smell and are not very clean, layout is terrible. Nothing to do other than shop, food is ridiculously expensive (US$16 for a Whopper meal). Had a 6 hour layover here and couldn't even get my boarding pass until 2 hours prior to boarding.",2.0
31,Arrived at BKK airport in early October and departed a week later. I have used BKK airport many times in the past 3 years. Overall it's a decent airport despite the large scale. Normally the biggest issue at BKK airport is the long queue in immigration. I was lucky this time as when I arrived there was almost no queue. The drama started after the great first impression. Due to bad weather the airport had to suspend all ground service. As a result we were waiting by the luggage reclaim belt for a long time until we saw a signed saying the ground service is suspended. Then we waited for longer and finally a ground staff came to inform us the luggage wouldn't be delivered any time soon. And when the ground service resumed we were shocked to see other flights that landed much later have their luggage delivered earlier than our flight which landed 2 hours ago. All in all a 2 hour wait by the luggage belt without much information isn't a pleasant experience and should have been dealt with better.,6.0
32,"Airport seems designed for a temperate zone, A/C unable to cope with tropical sun. Most parts of the airport are warm during the day and most travellers can be seen huddling around the A/C vents. At least the interior is bright.",4.0
33,"Very disappointing experience. Impolite staff at the information desk, one passenger who was in hurry asked few times the same question and the employee screamed on him!! Never seen anything like that. Very poor duty free. No smoking area which is really a big issue after you travel for hours and you have to wait for a connecting flight. I think I will never fly again with Thai just to avoid the transit at this airport.",1.0
34,"I had a nine hour layover in this airport recently. I decided that on arrival I would transit (from international arrivals to international departures), buy a book to read and spend some time in a pay lounge. Arrival was at a gate (instead of standing remotely, as is often the case), about 400 metres walk to the transit area, and there were moving walkways most people used. When I arrived at transit security there was a line of about 50 people, staff looked to be under pressure and were grumpy, but I still was able to get through to the departure level in a reasonably short time. I then managed to buy a novel in an Asia Books outlet that kept me entertained, but it was from a relatively small and not very interesting selection. As other posters have mentioned, the air-conditioning in this building is not great, and the area I found myself in was warm and unpleasant. Instead of waiting in this area (my pay lounge booking still required a wait of several hours before I could enter), I went searching for a better place and found one in F area that at this time of day definitely was cooler and a seat became available not long after I arrived. I connected to the free airport wifi (I normally use AIS free airport wifi), but even though in my experience it's an OK service, it is limited to a couple of hours, so something to keep in mind. While I waited I avoided going near any food outlets as their pricing is probably three or four times what you’d pay elsewhere. It’s true that there’s a food court in the building, but that is landside, and not available in International Departures, where you can expect to pay four times the street price for a bottle of water, and four times the street price for a typical Thai treat, mango with sticky rice. Outlets are often crowded and the staff rude: I don't see the value. I used a pay lounge (I bought entry through a third party before I arrived in BKK) which offered free wifi for the time I was there, comfortable seating, a wide range of hot and cold foods from a buffet selection, drinks (water, fruit juices, beer and wine) — and importantly, shower facilities. it cost about B1,000 but compared to the cost of buying these products and services ‘unbundled’ elsewhere in Departures, it was good value. Closer to departure time, the walk from the lounge to my departure gate meant walking from one side of the terminal (F) to the other (A), taking more than 20 minutes. There’s very little in the way of moving walkways when you move across the terminal, so until you get to the departure area there’s little choice but to keep walking (much easier if you only have the lightest cabin baggage with you). Maybe the airport wants people to embark on a buying expedition through the shops on either side, but in my opinion there are better bargains to be had elsewhere. Flights to Australia have an additional security check before you are allowed in the departure lounge. The staff always check for liquids, so my advice is to drink any bottled water before you arrive and if you have bought liquor at duty free, ask the sales staff about picking it up after departure gate security. The departure lounge itself had adequate seating for a heavily booked A350, and there were toilets. Overall, the airport functions OK but Singapore is a much better transit airport.",4.0
35,"Nightmare! Transiting through, spent 1 hour getting through the passport control to get in, another hour to get out. Very unpleasant staff. And that all just because of the connection to be made and the stupid decision to close all the smoking areas, they are all empty, the airport itself is pretty worn down, and they are still empty! Never again!",1.0
36,"My sister and I arrived at Bangkok airport on Thursday 25th July around 9:30pm. We were exhausted from 14 hours of flying and it was our first time in Thailand. We met the woman at passport control and I have to say that she is probably the rudest, nastiest and angriest people I have ever met in my entire life. She screamed at us, told us to go away on several occasions and physically moved us to one side. This was because we wrote down the address of our hostel incorrectly - she motioned to the woman next to us that we were stupid (she waved her hand across her forehead and rolled her eyes several times). We tried to explain that this was our first visit to Bangkok and that addresses are written differently in the UK and she told us to just shutup and go away. After shouting at us to go away, she got up and physically moved us. We were scared and anxious - thousands of people around us in a city we have never been to before. She then threatened my little sister into keeping her passport when she had done absolutely nothing wrong, she tried to ask the woman what she needed to do to get through passport control. When she finally stamped our passports after around 15 minutes of this, she looked at me and shook her head. She did not only treat us like this - many others were being screamed out and moved by her. We were appalled by this vile woman and it wasn’t not a nice start to our visit into Bangkok.",1.0
37,After having had a long flight I was expecting to be able to have a cigarette at Suvarnambhumi aaiport before taking my onward flight to Tokyo. There were no smoking rooms and the staff were really rude when I asked them if there is any facility for smoking passengers. Suvarnabhumi airport has declared war against the smoking passengers but do not cringe from receiving payment from the same passengers. Shame on Suvarnabhumi airport for being so biased against the smokers. Shame! You take away our Human Rights to smoke.,1.0
38,"1) Poorly managed lines for security 2) Extremely rude security staff. Threw items into the belt. I had my shoes thrown. Happened after Door 3 at 10.00hrs. One of the lady airport staff had a sulking face as if it was a chore for her to work on a Sunday morning. 3) Took more than hour to reach the customs counter. Arrived airport at 09.30hrs but cleared my passport only at 10.34hrs 4) Not a positive travellers experience. Carpet was dirty, toilet was dirty.",4.0
39,The most ridiculous airport and airport staff. I had to do their job for them because they were not able to search up my passport details on the computer to check my esta waiver was valid. At first I told them to check it on the system and they told me that they couldn’t. 1 hour later while I was waiting for them to do magic I showed them on my phone my esta waiver approval and then they did their job right and searched my passport details on the esta waiver website. The stress that the staff put me through was ridiculous. Either do your job correctly and call someone to do it for you if you have no clue.,1.0
40,"At Suvarnabhumi Airport the airline staff at check-in and security staff are good. The problem comes at the departure administration. On that day, only 1 departure admin hall was open. (Hall 3) I took the departure escalator at about 1.45pm and cleared passport control at 3.05pm (a total of 1 hour 20 mins !) There is a security clearance queue which took about 15 to 20 mins, in general, it is reasonable time as security is important. The passport control is however very disappointing, it was a 1 hour queue with the following observations while waiting in line. Elderly and groups with very young children/infants are in the queue. In all other airports I visited, the elderly and groups with young children will be helped and moved to a separate queue for their convenience. It is frustrating to see old people having to stand in line for over 1 hour and parents struggling to keep their children in line. This is extremely poor service, the passport check officer in front of the escalator should have advised these people to use the priority lane. Only 4 out of 8 counters are open on the section I am in. I would assume it is probably the same in other sections. There are a lot of extra processing (photo taking?) at the passport control. There is no staff managing the queuing, so it is really messy with people criss-crossing queues. Any staff that were there are not really interested in helping passengers, if any passenger approach them, they will be ""served"" rudely. Despite arriving at the airport almost 3 hours before my flight, I actually had hardly any time in the transit area. I can only grab a quick bite and go to the gate. There is no time for shopping or any of that. I am sure a lot of other passengers who arrived 2 hours may even have trouble getting to the gate on time. Hopefully, the authorities can receive this review and other similar ones critically and make necessary improvements.",3.0
41,Main international airport of Bangkok that is stretched way beyond its capacity. Immigration lines are ridiculously long and can average around 45 minutes to an hour just to get your passports stamped. They should really look to ensure all counters are staffed during peak periods.,3.0
42,"My departure was at Gate 5. This gate is in an awkward direction than the other gates and required lots of walking. Washrooms are situated at G1 whereas the other one is at G5 lower floor. They denied its use due to security reasons as boarding was not started. On inquiry, they told us to go back to G1 for use of toilet. I had to walk 10 minutes to and 10 minutes for the toilet. Never seen such a poor design of an airport, anywhere.",1.0
43,"The phrase land of smiles is synonymous with Thailand except when you land at Suvarnabhumi airport! The distance required to travel from the plane by bus to the terminal is some distance, taking 7 minutes. The queuing time is the worst I've experienced, and it now happens everytime I land here. There are plenty of empty counters and it never used to be this bad, and the staff don't seem to smile either so sadly this ranks as a rapidly declining airport. The expansion which is steeped in controversy is supposed to the airport more functional and take more captivity, try fixing the simple important things first, this won't be the last review I LL be writing about the airport.",4.0
44,"Used this airport twice for transit in March 2018 and the experience was still vivid in my memory. Unfriendly staff, most were not smiling which was ironic since Thailand is supposed to be a land of smiles. Airport looked old and dull. Needed to walk for 20 mins to 30 mins to get to our departure gate. Terrible design.",3.0
45,"Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport is indeed a very huge airport. It takes quite a bit of time to walk from the arrival gates to the immigration area. Signs were clear and there were provisions for citizens from Singapore and Hong Kong to use the automated immigration clearance which helped with the experience at the airport. The departure process, unlike the arrival process, can be pretty confusing. For instance, security checks often snake in a weird way. There was an instance where you proceed from the security area by walking back through the initial security area. Otherwise, the food choices there were decent, albeit slightly expensive.",7.0
46,"I want to meet the genius who put terminals in the middle of nowhere, and the toilets behind locked boarding gates so you can only use 20 minutes before your flight. How about offering free wifi you dont have to sign into with a passport and then blocks you like every other airport in the world. Could definitely use a facelift as well.",4.0
47,"Weather in May is quite warm in Bangkok as this is the summer month. I checked in, completed immigration formalities and was heading to the departure gate. I had waiting duration of about 2 hours for boarding the flight. As I walked towards my gate, I could sense that the Air Conditioning was not functioning and it continued to be without air con for rest of my walk and for my entire waiting. Everyone was in uneasiness and looking for cooler areas to rest. Such a pathetic and careless operation of one of the busiest airport, shows the level of customer service.",3.0
48,Queues for miles. Walk for many more. Every time arriving or departing through this airport is a trial in patience and exercise. Immigration queues for arrival and departure are always hundreds of people long and take around an hour each. Unbelievable that this has continued on for years. Passengers and flight numbers are known well in advance. This is just bad management. Then the airport design is for the athletically minded. Always have to walk many miles to departure gates. Bad design in general. It’s a concrete bunker that is not very appealing.,3.0
49,I've used Bangkok-Survanhabhumi airport a few times. This airport is huge and modern. It's easy accessible from downtown by train and a few places in Thailand by bus. The terminal is divided into 7 concourses (from A to G) and it can be long walking distances depending where your boarding or arrival gate is. Some airplanes are parked in remote stands which saves the walking distances as a bus brings passengers closer to the bagage claim on arrivals. I like the architecture of the terminal with Thai elements inside the terminal. However it can be hot inside the terminal at some places as the air conditioning is not strong enough. Also some places like the checking and immigration areas can be crowded. There is a food court with local food and reasonable prices below the arrivals floor. The lines at the passport control can be long but you can go to the opposide section for less waiting depending of time arrival. The security control is efficent better than some airports in the United States. Overall this airport despite its big size is quite good. It's a bummer that there's no US or Canadian carriers operating there.,7.0
50,Huge airport but traveling in between the terminals is exhausting. You have to walk all the way. Travelators are few and far between. There are escalators for going down but no escalators for going up. Air conditioning is suboptimal. Very limited Halal food options for Muslims.,5.0
51,"One of my favourite airports, Suvarnabhumi is pretty good. Baggage claim waiting time is short. Plenty of clean amenities. Food and duty free are as expensive as any international airport. Suvarnabhumi is now about 12 years old and beginning to show its age. Air conditioning along the concourse, between the gate and duty free areas, has been cut. The concourse areas are uncomfortably hot. It is running at the departure gate though. The other problem is limited seating at the departure gate. There is probably 60-70 seats. Nowhere near enough for the 320 people about to board a B747-400.",8.0
52,The whole airport is extremely hot. I feel bad for people who work here. Air-conditioning was not working enough. The worst thing was that our flight was delayed and we had to wait 4 hours more. We are boiling.,1.0
53,"The worst of all airports that I have ever visited! The walk from one side to another, in particular if you’re going to a lounge, is incredibly long! A buggy will not take you unless you pay, wait for this, AUD $100!. For the elderly this is absurd! When we finally found the Emirates Lounge we were told that there will not be a flight announcement. This is unheard of in such a large airport! After passing customs we purchased some water only to have them confiscated before boarding! I was infuriated. Bottles were not opened. There are three further check points before boarding which most passengers are not aware off. The walking we did in this long extended badly designed airport was made even more excruciating due to the lack of signage and the non-existing air condition. The lack of English speaking people makes it extremely hard to communicate. This airport turned me off visiting Bangkok ever again!",2.0
54,"Overall, despite a nice huge and equiped structure, this airport lacks significant aspects making it very uncomfortable and far beyond from the category of a friendly airport. Without going into the details, I shall breifly highlight the aspects that require inevitable changes to make it more human friendly. 1) Extremely poor human interactions with most of the airport staff, due to lack of professionalism, respect and honour for travellers. Communication in English, which is widely regraded as a fundamental in most places; is a serious problem since majority can't communicate properly OR at least it is not understandable. On top of that hospitality should be taught generally, as most staff are rude to an extent. 2) A world class airport structure, while lacking some basic facilities, including baby travel facilities, private lounge for short stay (not inclduing the one for members or business class travellers). It is extremely difficult as the airport if definietly not family friendly for those travelling with infants. 3) Limited food availability, especially options for those looking for Halal or vegeterian food.",3.0
55,That’s crazy that an important transit airport does not have a smoking room! After long time on board once you are in the airport waiting for another long flight connection every smoker needs to smoke! No way! 24 hours without smoking! Crazy crazy crazy! And the craziest thing is that in duty free they sell cigarettes! Every airport must have a smoking area for smokers needs! Bad airport!,1.0
56,"Bad decision to transit at BKK with kids, never again. We were coming from Narita, transiting in BKK, final destination is Singapore. We carried two water bottles for my kids, and bought two grape juices in 150ml bottles for my kids before boarding the plane at Narita. At the transit check, the officer was adamant that we throw away the unfinished grape juice, but said the water bottles were okay. So we poured away the water in the water bottles, and filled it up with half emptied bottles of grape juice. The officer said that is not allowed. We do not understand why, and she could not give us a good explanation and insisted that we have to pour away the grape juice before they will let us proceed. When the bottles had water, it was allowed, but replaced with grape juice, suddenly it was against their airport policy. This unreasonable treatment of families with young kids is the reason why we will never want to transit at BKK. I hope other families who are considering transits will go elsewhere because, the staff are unfriendly and unsympathetic toward families with kids.",2.0

I am from Singapore, even our government is strict and wanted whole country to be smoke free.

60,"I live in Bangkok and fly frequently through Suvarnabhumi. It's a relatively new airport, but was over capacity nearly from the start, and you really feel it. Flights almost never leave on time, often sitting on the tarmac awaiting take off. Many flights use a bus to offload passengers instead of the gates, which is so poorly organized that waiting on the plane for a bus for 20 minutes is not uncommon. Long waits for baggage are also the norm. I waited over an hour for bags on a recent domestic flight -- longer than the actual flight from Chiang Mai itself! The airport itself is also terrible -- cold, exposed concrete everywhere looks like a prison, air con intermittent, staff don't speak English, and over the years, good food and coffee options have all been replaced by high-end clothing shops and Burger King, so there's little in between. Immigration and security lines can also be very long, but you never know, so you always have to leave a lot of extra time, and this airport is a terrible place to spend it.",1.0

Secondly, this airport loves its constant automated flight announcements, and insists on exclaiming the codeshare flights and then in 3 languages - silent airports, like Singapore Changi, work better.

From getting to the airport to then getting into the airport itself, it's just a long and tedious experience. The airport has 4 different floors, which are incredibly hard to navigate if you are arriving by the Airport Rail Link system. Good luck using that with your luggage! The staff are just unhelpful which is in keeping with the local population in general. Your plane is very unlikely to actually be at your departure gate, so most of the time you'll need to get a bus from the departure gate, away from the airport where your plane will be waiting. Yes Thailand is the country where your plane is probably not in the actual airport. Arriving to this airport is somehow even worse, with the planes landing away from the terminals and you'll need to ride a bus back to the arrival terminal. Immigration - HA! Ridiculous. The queues are always massive and in typical Thai fashion, there'll be plenty of staff wandering around but not actually doing their jobs. If you're traveling with infants, you might be able to use a shorter queue if you're lucky and someone is actually working on that desk. If you have a visa already, make sure to show the staff the visa because they often don't check and end up canceling your visa and giving you a standard 15 day visa instead.",3.0

Transfer/security checking was a bit difficult to find and you may miss it if you fail to notice it. Signage is not good. Lavatories are dirty. Staff are rude and that's the way they welcome visitors to Thailand. Language ability is low and word choices used are very offensive.

78,"We travelled to Bangkok on a family holiday in March 2018. Since me and my wife were smokers we got two cartons of cigarettes each from the departure airport duty free and little did we know that the only one carton per person was permitted as per Thai custom rules. Since this was for personal consumption we didn't think there would be a problem but the nightmare was about to start. We didn't declare the extra pack at the customers as we were not aware of the rules and passed the customs without issues but were pulled back by a police/security officer as were trying to exchange money and asked to follow him into the Airport Customs room because the security/police guy spotted the duty free bag. These guys were not interested in anything else but cigarettes. Right from the very start we were treated with no respect whatsoever. We tried to explain that this was for personal consumption, there was no intent on selling cigarettes in Thailand when a pack of cigarettes in their country. The customs lady just wouldn't allow us to speak or say a word, we were threatened with 4 days in jail if we didn't pay the $1,000 fine. The customs lady didn’t have any concern for the kids or take into consideration that we were a family. It was a traumatizing experience for all of us.  I can understand that there is a job to be done but do it with ethics, professionalism and integrity, especially when you have little children and don’t have a clue who is sitting in front of you. The troubling thing here was that we felt completely helpless and there was nobody that we could turn for help and anything could have happened to us that day in the hands of this.",1.0

We went around the airport like sheep being corralled. IT was beyond belief that this airport treated international transit passengers with such absolute disregard. The delay was due to security with 2 scanners for what looked like 5 airlines arriving at the same time. Staff were disinterested in anyones concerns about missing their flight. Just said stay in line. Another passnger who uses this route regularly says it is always like this? What? It is 2018 not 1990's!

Downsides - the continued noise in 3 languages warning of imminent departures which are not necessary.

On our departure, we discovered the worst airport experience we have ever had. Although a big crowd was expected for the festival, the queue was terribly organised. There was no one helping to organise the queue. All the passengers were just confusedly flowing to random lanes at security check and immigration points. My partner and I went to the immigration counter together as we have normally done in other airports in many places. On our arrival, we had no problem doing so. For this time, the officer angrily asked me what I was doing. I did not expect what we thought to be normal to provoke his anger. I politely replied ""can I not wait here"". He rudely told me to step back. When I got to him, I told him I thought it would speed things up for him to have all the passports at hand. He was even angrier and found an excuse that he only has two hands and there is only one camera. He kept his angry face going and scolded me even harder about the 'queuing policy'. I gave up in believing in the 'airport of smiles'. I believe many places that I have visited prefer visitors who travel together to be at the counter together. Even if this is not the case for Suvarnabhumi Airport, there should be signs indicating so. Rude officers do not help to ease airport congestion, but worsen it. Given the long unorganised queue behind me, the officer already wasted almost a minute scolding me.

The restaurants are expensive and of general poor quality. The wash basins in the toilets with their long U-shaped water dispensers are a disaster. They are permanently splashing water all over the floors. The duty free is considerably more expensive compared to other regional hubs. My main complaint, which I have made before, is not just the lack of A380 gates, however, but the complete absence of any obvious attempt over several years by the airport authority to upgrade more existing gates to make them accessible by more A380 aircraft. Last night I arrived from Hong Kong. The flight departure was delayed in part because BKK was not ready for another A380. Yet when we finally arrived almost 45 minutes late, the Emirates flight with about 600 on board arrived at a standard two airbridge gate. So upper deck passengers had to descend to the lower deck in order to exit along with hundreds of other economy passengers. It's no wonder this airport keeps falling down the rankings because the Airport Authority clearly has little interest in investing what must surely only be a small amount of capital to increase the already small number of gates capable of accommodating the A380.",2.0

The international chains they have such as Starbucks and Burger King go for around US$6/coffee, US$10 for a subway sandwich or $US10 for a burger. The authentic Thai handicrafts are ridiculously priced. I was looking at display pieces as a set and individual items cost upwards of $300/ per piece.

114,"I often go to Thailand for holiday or for work. So, this is a reflection of my observations while waiting in line, since there's nothing else to do but people watch. We should not be surprised by all the news surrounding the long queues at Suvarnabhumi (and Don Muang) airport. I feel they have taken for granted the number of tourists that head to Thailand for holiday, conferences, etc. Regardless of a one hour wait or five hours wait, they believe the tourists will come. The attitude is clearly seen by the behaviour and work ethics by many of the immigration officers. Most don't smile in the Land of Smiles even when I say hello and smile. Often times you see a number of them chatting away with the immigration officer sitting next to them. When I look over at a different counter, I catch a diligent officer processing 3 people in the time it takes to process me, and I don't even need a visa to get in. This inconsistency certainly adds to the wait time, regardless of whether or not all the counters are open. Lastly, when they are done with your passport, often times they place it on the counter closest to them (not in the middle or closest to you) so you have no choice but to extend your hand in to take it back. What kind of service is this? All of them should go on a mandatory hospitality course to understand how to treat customers and improve their image. Suvarnabhumi Airport may be one of the best architecturally designed airports (on the outside), but once inside, it's quite dark and unwelcoming. The toilets are smelly and the floor is always wet. It certainly has a lot more work to do if it wants to be a world class airport.",2.0
115,I travel to Thailand a lot and I was very disappointed to have to wait for nearly 1.5 hours to get through the immigration queue. During the immigration process there were at least 8 lanes empty of staff. This can only be blamed on mis-management of immigration and not caring about the tourists they are trying to get to visit Thailand. With better management the problem could be solved but they don't care. Very disappointing compared to when I flew into Thailand for the first time 10 years ago.,2.0
116,"""Airport of Smartphones"". This would be a great airport if the staff could put down their phones just once and actually do their job. Passenger flow is a mess. Just try the clown show to get from the departure to the mid level at the front. Some stairs you are allowed to take other not. They all lead to the same place. Security screening careless executed as everyone is working on their phones. Immigration has half at a maximum of the booths staffed and the booths that are staffed the officers all spent more time looking at their smartphone or gossiping than actually stamping. Get your act together Thailand and do something instead of making up excuses.",3.0
117,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi is the worst airport in the world. Long line up at immigration for over 2 hours. Don't Thai airport authorities plan how many staff they would need for the upcoming planes? The airport layout is also horrible. Why lock up passengers in enclosed waiting area for boarding? The restrooms are so dirty. The lighting is dim and dark. Water fountains never work so the travelers are forced to buy water bottles. The wifi is annoying to access. This airport is just awful. Avoid at all costs.,2.0
118,"Very poor facilities at the arrival gate. I had to walk for so long and search to find a toilet. Once I found a toilet, there was only one urinal and 2 closed toilets in that facility. Could not believe that a modern International Airport would build a toilet with one urinal. The staff were not friendly, the signages were poor and the whole departure process was cumbersome, checking our bags 3 times for a transit transfer. There were no catering or toilet facility near the gates where we had to wait for 4 hours.",4.0
119,"I have arrived and departed from Bangkok Suvarnabhumi airport many times and overall it is a decent airport. However I wish they would install some automated moving walkways or an automated people mover like at Hong Kong Airport to help passengers reach the more remote gates faster. Currently it can take as long as 20 minutes to reach your gate from the immigration area. Also more immigration officers are needed as this airport as the queues are often too long and many desks often remain unmanned in spite of this. Nevertheless dining options are excellent and shopping is decent although the duty free shops are ridiculously overpriced especially for confectionery. I waited until I reached Heathrow to buy confectionery and it was less than a third of the price of the same confectionery at the King Power Duty Free shops in Suvarnabhumi. If the management of Bangkok Suvarnabhumi seriously address these issues with the lack of moving walkways and immigration staff, this airport can go on to rival Changi Airport as one of the world's greatest.",7.0
120,"I recently spent five hours there. Well this was not my first time. I guess it was seventh or eight. But, this Airport never disappoints. Only once the queue for the security was very long, otherwise entirely smooth process. Shopping experience was excellent, as Suvarnabhumi offers many things for the people who love shopping. I have been travelling through this Airport for past couple of years and every time I experience something better than the previous. One thing that really impresses me is the courteous behaviour of the airport staff. Really is an airport of smiles. Much better as compared to Doha and Dubai in this regard.",8.0
121,"This airport has the worst transit system I have ever experienced! Traveling to and from Europe to Japan, transit has been a harrowing experience in both directions. The horridly rude staff herd people haphazardly through a non-air conditioned area (at 38C this time a year!) and turn a deaf ear on people with short transit times. After an hour or so of queuing, you are then left to run for 1km to your next gate. There are no shuttles, no ground staff taking care of people, nothing. This is definitely the worst I've ever seen, and Bangkok makes Paris CDG or Moscow seem like a walk in the park. Totally unbelievable experience, it's definitely the last time I travel to this airport!",1.0
122,"The terminal was really packed with travellers. Duty free and food service choices in the airport was not a lot even this is the biggest airport in Thailand.

123,"Can't understand the logic behind the design of Bangkok Suvarnabhumi airport. With information on departure gates not easily visible and the most frustrating thing is the absence of security check at the gates.

125,"Bangkok Suvarnabhumi is the most frustrating airport I have experienced (and I have been to lots). Upon arrival, there is a long walk from terminal to immigration (Emirates flights) where if you are lucky, can get through between 20 and 60 minutes. The most annoying thing is that you need to fill in an immigration card that you have to present with you passport - remember to complete this on the plane and sign it before you land because many don`t and it just causes unnecessary delays getting through the not-so-happy immigration staff. I always find the baggage reclaim ok - usually by the time you have managed to get through immigration, you don`t have long to wait for luggage. The worst part is when you are coming back for your return flight - it takes 3 times as long to get through security checks. When I was returning on 21st May, took us almost 3 hours to get through immigration because of the sheer volume of passengers, and only a few immigration staff on, who have just one speed - slow. It's just beyond the ridiculous - people were pushing and shoving and generally getting irate because they had timed flights and were cutting it fine. It's a nightmare - give yourself at least 4 hours at the airport for return.",5.0
126,"Because of a technical problem on my incoming flight, the transit time had shrunk to 40 minutes before the next flight's take-off. I have to say, in Kuala Lumpur, Singapore or Hong Kong that sort of time window would be ""just nice"" to walk over to another gate. Not so at Suvarnabhumi: Right after disembarking we were stopped by ground staff who asked to see our (used) boarding passes and checked them off the passenger manifest one by one, which took quite some time. Another staff member did wait around with my next flight number in hand, adding to the sense of urgency - but that is where any assistance ended. On my way to my next gate, I was stopped and harassed multiple times, told to join long queues at some of these arbitrary 'pit stops', and shouted at by security staff who even X-rayed my shoes. Upon finally reaching the gate, the ground staff demanded I step aside and produce my ""bag number"" (?). To be fair, I did make it, and so did my luggage. But the experience was a nightmare straight out of a bad action movie. Couldn't the ground staff send a buggy and/or an assistant to whisk me between gates, if time was a real issue? In the future I have to avoid this airport: Between the bizarre procedures, the lack of coordination and caring, and the very poor communication and English on the part of the very young staff, it clearly doesn't take much before things go horribly wrong.",2.0

128,"In general, if you can transit Asia via Changi, Hong Kong or KL airports, you should rather than BKK. And if you're not interested in going to Bangkok, entry to and exit from Thailand is more pleasant via Chiang Mai. The main reasons are BKK airports air con, noise and almost no seating in public areas. Air con: it's the worst feature in that is very inadequate still, and in some areas is very poor. You don't want to have to spend much time in the terminal, shops and eateries. Seating: almost none in the shopping areas. Noise: departure announcements are constant and almost pointless. This is not a silent terminal unlike a lot of modern terminals. Queues: Very good now. 1pm Friday, security 10 minutes, immigration 10 minutes. They've moved security to floor 5 and reduced the queue time, but it's hot up there which they're trying to resolve by the looks of it. But not good yet. Looks: from the outside the terminal looks great. Inside it doesn't feel cramped, the look being somewhat industrial.",4.0
129,Not keen on this airport and have been through it many times on the International side. This was the first time on the Domestic side. Quite a long distance to walk from security to the terminal although a travellator is available. Good selection of shops and food outlets but the passenger lounge is for international passengers only which was a let down. Don Muang has a lounge for Domestic passengers. On the amusing side the toilets are labeled as Happy Moment!,7.0
130,Do not transit through Bangkok. I tried a flight from Jakarta to Bangkok to Kolkata but the transit queue was huge and there is no fast track for business class. Not a comfortable way to travel and if Thai want to capture the transit market they will have to improve this. I will avoid it and switch to singapore or Malaysian as those airports are much easier.,3.0
131,"Large organised airport with a huge number of passengers. Upon pulling up to the terminal entrance by taxi, there were many trolleys available nearby and check in areas were divided into zones for groups of airlines. The 2 complaints I have relate to Fast Track and WiFi. Fast Track immigration took longer than a regular queue, and defeated the object of having a Fast Track facility. As for free WiFi access, you need email access in order to get an access password, which is kind of pointless as if one does not have internet access how will he or she get the password (catch 22 situation). For shopping there are countless number shops and eateries with quality products.",7.0
132,"Bangkok Suvarnabum is a really big airport where many planes don't connect directly to the terminal, but are parked in a distance with mandatory bus transportation to and from the terminal. There is a really irritating, time consuming and undersized security control when arriving in transit. We experienced this the first time and also on our second transit at Suvarnabum. The airport is neat and clean. Gates were easy to find - but it's impossible to work out how many levels and what to find on the different levels. The signs to / from the shopping area are missing or not visible enough. We happened to find the shopping area when we travelled through Suvarnabum en route to Mandalay - but in the other direction, back to Denmark, when we easily could and would have done some shopping, unfortunately we didn't find the shopping area.",8.0
133,"First complaint, Baggage delivery speed. I mentioned this in my Don Muang airport review, since Suvarnabhumi airport has one of the slowest baggage delivery systems in the world. You'd be very lucky if you got a D gate, Baggage delivery within 5 minutes. If you have a G gate, You're better off with carry ons if you're in a rush. I'm from Thailand, so immigration takes only a mere 2 minutes, but if you're a foreigner, be ready to wait an hour during rush hours (evening hours). Duty free here is overpriced, but I'm a king power member so I get a 15% discount, So it doesn't make a difference. Most lounges are pleasant, however avoid the Louis Tavern lounges. They are tiny overcrowded lounges. Tourists do cut queues, but well, it happens. I had an airport staff tell me she had a sore throat from yelling at tourists! Other than these complaints, I enjoy Suvarnabhumi airport since it's big and feels airy. The designers did a good job. Also, Wifi is pretty fast. Staff are pretty nice, but immigration staff are cold.",8.0
134,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi airport has a very long layout and it takes a long time to walk from one side to the other. Even if you are in transit you need to go through another security check before you enter the terminal. The security in the airport was tight and the clearance times are long.,7.0
135,"I couldn't write a more mixed review of any other airport - they're usually generally good or bad, but BKK is absolutely the ends of both spectrum. Arriving in BKK at 1am was a breeze. Cleared through customs really quickly, had our suitcases arrive shortly after us, found the taxi system straightforward and got into the city within an hour of touchdown. Perfect. Leaving BKK at 8am was the worst experience I have ever had at an airport in my life. We left a lot of time, over 2 and a half hours, because I had a feeling one of our suitcases would incur oversize baggage fees and it might take a few minutes to sort out. The lady at the counter of China Southern was very blunt and rude to us (not BKK's fault, but I digress). In the end we were told it will cost 5,500 baht and we need to pay it before we can check our bags in. That's fine, except for the fact that the place you pay for the excess baggage is halfway down the building and at peak times incredibly difficult to navigate, then wait in another line, then come all the way back to check our bags in. What should have taken 10 minutes ended up taking over an hour. Immigration/passport check took over another hour. They had no way of fast tracking people who were leaving soon, and they were completely out of the forms you're meant to fill in while you're standing in line, which held things up tremendously because we had to do it at the counter as fast as possible. There were at least 4 empty cubicles that could have been staffed and there were hundreds and hundreds of people trying to get through. Once that mess was over we had to run as fast as we could to the very, very end gate just as they were doing the final boarding call for our flight. I'm not an emotional person but my 'no crying in public' rule was definitely broken that morning. By the time we got to the gate I was struggling to breathe and we just made it before they closed the walkway off. Such a ridiculous rigmarole to go through despite being there well before our flight, if there is a next time we will surely try to pick a middle of the night flight so we aren't competing with a thousand other travelers for a spot in the line. Not a nice start to a 20 hour journey home. I can't even comment on the seating, shopping or toilets because we didn't even have a spare 30 seconds to see any of them.",2.0
136,"Got through check-in in good time and then with passport control had to pass through 3 different queues to be cleared. By the time we had cleared the last queue for this we had a long run to the bording gate to be met with the plane has left. This took over a hour to clear passport control with no announcements of last calls for boarding so we could fast track flights leaving. Total disgrace and cost us as a family of 3 travelling a packet to buy new tickets. Get more operators at passport control and allow announcements so travellers can be prioritised if held up! Very disappointed in service here, never seen international airport run this area so badly. Makes one wonder if airlines give kickbacks to customs for delaying passengers so they buy extra tickets?",2.0
137,"This airport is functioning quite well on both arrivals and departures. Departure was smooth with a bagage drop wich lasted 5 minutes. Thru security and immigration within 20 minutes. Plenty of food and drink to choose from. Duty free is plentiful. The only downer is the price at the airport which can exceed European airports. The food and drink can be very expensive. The wifi connection is hard to get. But it works. Overall the airport is OK, but plan at least 2H before your flight for potential bottlenecks at the immigration, mainly created by tourists forgetting to fill in departure cards or wearing a cap for photos etc..",7.0

Our flight time was 5.50am so we arrived at the airport at 3.25am. Plenty of time to enjoy an otherwise fun and interesting airport. Since my wife and I are both 1K with Star Alliance we sailed through the ticketing process and headed to passport control. Because of the infinite stupidity of whoever decides how to staff passport control it took us over an hour to get through. Why, because there were only 2 people assigned to passport control! There were enough planes taking off early that morning that it should have been staffed with at least half a dozen checkers. As it turned out we had about 5 minutes before boarding began for our flight. Just enough time to run to our gate. Other people in line were very concerned that they had missed their flight. All travelers departing from BKK pay an airport fee. A fee that should cover an adequate number of staff at passport control. For the record, I have departed form BKK at least 50 times and this is the first time passport control has been so bungled.",1.0

Negatives for regular visitors are the loud audio messages recorded incorrectly in English and played multiple times, thus ""Attention please this is the final call OF (instead of the word FOR) flight...""

142,"Bangkok Suvarnabhumi taxi system has changed. It's no longer the counter that writes the name of the driver on a chit form and telling the driver where to go. Now, the system requires the passenger to press on an e-board to get a queue number. After that, the taxi will arrive to pick you up. Good? Well it does reduce manpower and perhaps technology is useful. But bad, because the drivers who drive in to the alloted queue number will not know where the passenger is going to. To be honest, my recent experience was a very negative one. 99% of passengers who arrive at Suvarnabhumi will be heading towards central metropolitan Bangkok or thereabouts in that direction. Instead the driver who was alloted to my number, he said that he was heading to Chonburi. If he was heading to Chonburi, then he should drive there direct and not pick up passengers. Trying your luck is a waste of my time. Anyway, his suggestion was to take me out to the main road so that I could transfer to another taxi outside. Now, this is really a waste of my time and putting me at risk. Hope that such drivers are well disciplined in future.",3.0
143,I've reviewed Bangkok Suvarnabhumi before and said I was pleased with how the queuing situation has improved. However the authorities seem to have gone backwards in this respect as the queues at immigration and security were too long both in arrival and departure. I appreciate that I was travelling during the busy festive period but then several immigration desks were closed and too many were for Thai passport holders only. By the time I arrived at the baggage reclaim almost all the baggage had come off and had I been a few minutes later I'd have likely had to go off and chase staff for suitcase. While catering facilities remain of a high standard the King Power duty free shops are overpriced especially for confectionery and three or four times the price of a normal retailer back in the UK and considerably more expensive than in Brunei airport. Furthermore the airport still lacks moving walkways in the departures area meaning it can take a long time to walk from security to the departure gate. Overall the airport authorities must increase the number of immigration and security staff.,6.0

The most important part is that we have to walk 200 to 300 metres just to get a toilet. I think this is unacceptable. I hope the airport will work something out for future passengers.",4.0

Immigration during arrival was efficient, but slow during departure. Airside was nice and airy, definitely a nice place to shop around before flying off.",6.0
147,"I have gone through this airport 8 tines in the past 3 months. It is a well organised and clean airport. The Airport Rail Link is a convenient option which lets travelers go between the city centre and Suvarnabhumi Airport. There are ample public taxis available for passengers wishing to get into the city. Just go to the taxi counter and get a queue number from a vending machine. With the number printed on the ticket, just find the matching berth number on the row of taxis waiting for passengers. Once you locate the berth whose number matches the ticket number you have been issued, just walk to the parked taxi and hand the ticket to the driver. It will be useful if you have printed the address of your destination (preferably in the Thai language). As there is only one terminal, there is almost always long queues first at the security check point for passengers leaving Bangkok, and again queues at the immigration check point. Once you have cleared the security and immigration check-points, you will then need to make your way to the gate which at times, may be a long walk away especially if your gate is far from the immigration area. The airport is one big and long airport so ample time before departure is highly recommended. The advantage of being early is that there are many food options to choose from while waiting for your flight.",7.0

It was refreshing to step off the plane into a large bright airport. The walk in between piers could be long so make sure you have plenty of connection time. One of our friends didn't have her luggage tagged to the final destination so had to clear immigration and re checkin again. To my surprise it didn't take her long at all. By the time we arrived at the domestic pier after a long walk she made it there as well. Departure experience this time was also pleasant. The check in counter was fairly empty (EVA Air) and no long queue in security/immigration. There are decent shops in the terminal as well as some restaurant. The CIP lounges are clean, quiet and very well organised.

151,"Being from the US, I know many bad airports where security lines are ridiculously long and immigration, without Global Entry, can be a nightmare. Bangkok isn't anywhere near that bad, but compared to its neighbours at Changi, Incheon, Haneda and Narita, it's definitely second level. We have flown in and out of BKK numerous times, typically on the Tigerair hop from Singapore. This review covers our flight in November 2016. Arrival was fairly smooth. Immigration lines were long, but they moved pretty rapidly. I'd estimate about a 20 minute wait. By comparison, immigration time at Changi was about two minutes. Departure was where it got interesting. Check-in was smooth. However, when we got on the escalator to go up to security, there was one single person checking boarding passes to get into the security line. That line was backed up to the escalator and people literally had no room to queue and were falling over each other getting off. Very bad form. The security line was probably about 30 minutes. Tolerable, but still pretty long. Changi's security at the gate works a lot better. Immigration, for a change, was only about five minutes. We've been in hour long lines that crawl, so this was a pleasant surprise. We have the Priority Pass lounge card, so we went to the Oman Air lounge, as friends had warned us the Louis CK lounges were pretty gruesome. Oman Air was comfortable, but as with the Sakura Lounge we had made use of on another flight, food selection was, at best, limited. We arrived at the gate just as boarding commenced, so I can't opine about seat comfort at that location. Push back was on time, so no delays. It's a decent airport, but with a little more attention to detail, it could be very good.",6.0
152,"I've travelled through Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport many times a year since it opened a decade ago. The most improved part of the airport is the Security Screening, usually a 5 minute process, but rarely have I seen all the machines in operation. The worst part of the airport has to be Immigration both arriving and departing. It's been many years since Immigration was a 10 minute event... and I've waited nearly an hour on many occasions. If you're in the taxi rank within an hour of landing you've done pretty well. Never have I seen more than 50% of the Immigration booths manned, and often it's a lot less than that so clearly the authorities have no concern with passengers waiting an hour to get their passport stamped. The sooner they replace the surly immigration officers with robots the better. Check in areas are fine and mostly well organised. Baggage reclaim is good but I'm not sure what Customs do in BKK. The retail and food business in BKK are a rip off with the objective of squeezing the last of passengers money out of them before they depart. 300 THB for some noodles, 70THB for a bottle of water and 280THB for a beer is nonsense. I've not bought anything in the Duty Free for years.",6.0
153,"Crowded and poorly organised. Queues for passport checks are massive and nothing is done to prevent queue jumping by other travellers which is prevalent and very annoying. Getting through from check-in to airside takes far too long. Food options are limited and very expensive, bring some food with you. Immigration staff on arrivals and departures are miserable and officious, hardly a great welcome to the Land of Smiles, more akin, though not as bad as the open hostility often shown by US immigration staff to visitors. One very good thing though is that once you get through customs on arrival there are stalls for all 3 of Thailand's mobile phone service providers and the staff are fantastic and extremely helpful. Swapping your home country SIM for a Thai SIM for the duration of your stay is a breeze. In fact I'd kept my Thai DTAC SIM from my holiday 6 months previously and the DTAC people just topped it up for me and I kept the same number. I've used Swampy (as the airport's known to us farangs) several times and it's OK really but the queues for security and immigration are horrendous and the staff are less than friendly though scrupulously polite, it has to be said. Taxi's from the airport to downtown Bangkok are another bone of contention. Frequently over priced and scam-tastic. Trying to find cheaper alternatives like the train or bus, both of which are present at Swampy, is like a quest to find the Holy Grail. Well hidden and obscured. Not surprising as they are significantly cheaper (10% of the cost of a taxi). Sadly I think the staff at Swampy don't get to see the best of their visitors and like Thai's in other parts of Thailand who have to deal with stroppy, entitled, rude and even drunk foreign visitors, it's left many Thai staff rather jaded. So in conclusion, it's a safe place and it functions relatively well but on the whole it's often not as nice an experience as it could be.",6.0
154,"Thailand was my choice of destination when living in mainland China (Beijing and Guangzhou) to escape Chinese New Year and the office. While the airport is not perfect I am of the opinion it is actually well designed, the most vexing thing is departures but more about that later. For arrivals the airport system is like any other, you are directed from your gate through to passport control that has multiple terminals and is always well-staffed then to baggage control, I have never been in a long wait for this and can't have spent more than 45 minutes in total from leaving the aircraft to getting my bags. On leaving the arrivals gate one gets a sense that tourism is obviously a mainstay of the economy. Both flightside and check-in areas are both well stocked with shops and restaurants, banks, currency exchange and tourist information. Best to head down to the 7/11 or Family Mart at the arrivals gate for a Chang beer or ice cold water to combat the heat, after that there are plenty of transport methods from the airport but best to use the main taxi area so as not to fall to a tourist trap - they will issue a receipt. Departures is much the same though the system bottlenecks after check in that causes longer queues.",8.0
155,"I visit Bangkok regularly as a weekend getaway. Suvarnabhumi airport was opened under the direction to challenge Singapore as a hub. It was already a disappointment when it was opened but I cannot believe my eyes that the quality has gone to the dogs. Arrival is still acceptable but departure is a disaster. The experience is worsened by the flood of tourists who love to cut queues, speaking in loud voices, and crammed together. The customs and security checks are a nightmare. I have not seen such slow speed whether it is scanning the bags or going through the custom officers. The management of this airport do not have sense of urgency despite Bangkok being a number one tourist hub and major transport centre. Please try to use the refurbished older airport (hosting mostly regional budget airlines) if you are flying in and out from South East Asia.",4.0
156,"Bangkok airport's experience varied heavily depending on your flight time. Transportation is ok with taxis and trains (taxi drivers are getting to be less dependable). Check-in can be a bit of a queue but online check-in solves that issue. Lately however all seems more hectic. Security check is acceptable. However for a while now I thought immigration got their act together. Unfortunately the lines are now longer than ever with passengers lining up from the ground floor departure passport control all the way up the escalators backed up to till the upper floor x-rays and security gates. Officers gawking at each passport for ages and guaranteed us almost 90 min to get through. And forget about the smiles. All through the airport mediocre service with visible no interest. Arrivals was a tad better, however it is getting annoying as walking distances are truly long and cannot imagine the elderly going all that way (in kms!). Lately the closer immigration point is always blocked and all are requested to walk another 400+m to access the other one. Duty free a farce with prices many times higher than in the city. Have to use this airport but for transit passengers, try Kuala Lumpur or Singapore if you have any say in the matter.",4.0
157,"Having travelled via many airports, I find Bangkok Airport to be very useful and relaxing. I am driven to write this review as many I have read have bemoaned this airport due to forces beyond their control. eg flight hold up on arrival or queues at customs. However lets not detract from what are the real benefits of the airport and the many offerings. Food and beverages are in plenty and very low cost in comparison to many other airports, this is on both sides, off air side and air side, if travelling with a family this is a considerable cost saving. Many toilets are on offer to a very high standard of hygiene. Also many IT ports, USB, WiFi and plugs available, as is seating and lounge areas. As an ex smoker I can say there are many more areas to smoke then in other western airports and all very well air conditioned. You do not come out smelling like an ashtray. The airport also has a buzz, a living soul and very friendly people. The problem with other new airports is that they are all tinsel and chrome and have no soul or passion. Check in is very quick and efficient as is the process through security, the only delays sometimes is with customs, but then that is expected as Thailand takes its security seriously, knowing who's come in and who is out. Overall a great and impressive airport, one that you don't mind spending some time at.",10.0
158,"After a very pleasant lounge experience, an excellent flight and an on-time arrival at 23.45, it was maddening once again for the Emirates A380 to be held on the the tarmac for a full 30 minutes because a TG A380 had not left the gate designated for Emirates arrival. This has now happened on every single A380 late evening arrival from Hong Kong I have taken this year - without exception. I have written before that the airport management just will not adapt more gates for the increasing number of A380 arrivals. It is an utter disgrace. The management usually react to problems instead of anticipating them. In this instance, they are not even reacting. They just sit back and do nothing whilst angry passengers sit endlessly on the tarmac! Add to this arrival at a gate on the east side of the terminal when EK normally arrives on the west and the hugely long walk to get to Immigration and BKK is rapidly becoming the worst managed airport in the region.",1.0
159,Endless announcements on the microphone. I was on transit and had roughly 5 hours in the middle of the night. I found some great reclining seats at the airport and hoped to sleep well. It was only 5 minutes and I realised it was impossible. There were constant announcements that made it impossible to have a peaceful sleep. I wish they would get good sense and convert it into a silent airport at least for the sake of midnight transit passengers.,5.0
160,"Using the fastrack immigration service at this airport appears to be a waste of time. On my last arrival, the fastrack was filled with economy passengers from Emirates. I asked why there were long queues and was told that regular immigration was very busy so they had diverted passengers into the fastrack. What then is the point of paying for a fastrack service to avoid queues at peak times if excess passengers are transferred there?",5.0
161,"Do not understand why this airport has a relatively low rating. It is spacious, well built, signs are clear, everything is well-marked. Yes, crowds are sometimes overwhelming, and queuing at immigration on departure could be improved, but shopping is fantastic, food outlets are good and plentiful, WiFi is free and good and seating at the gates ample, with a good architecture.",8.0
162,"Upon arrival after a long flight with Thai Airways coming from London, we arrived, swiftly de-boarded the aircraft and then walked to the immigration queues to get into Thailand. The immigration queue took over an hour to get through. This is ridiculous as at Heathrow it took us 10 minutes to go through. We had a great 2 week holiday, and then drove back to the airport to catch our flight back to London. The check in was quick (about 5-10 minutes) and then we moved to the security area. Above each machine (Full body scanners, well, 2 out of 3 as one for some reason was not functioning) there is a tv screen playing a video. It tells you to take out all your tech (phones, tablets, laptops, watches etc etc.) so I followed this when we got to the machine and had to place everything in those plastic trays. I take out my phone and place it in my tray, the staff member making pick's it up, and throws my phone back into my bag. I then take my watch off and again it is thrown back into my bag. I have used the airport 5 times in the past 5 years and never have I had this occur. As for the terminal side of things, it has everything but a McDonald's to eat at, which I believe would greatly improve the food and cuisine options airside.",1.0
163,"I wish I could give this airport a negative review. For starters, this airport is a torrid nightmare for transit passengers, especially if you disembark in say terminal D and have to proceed to terminal E and you have only a short time period to catch the connecting flight. Well, design woes aside, what really makes this airport bite is the quality of staff. The attitude of the staff is very poor and especially in security, they were rude and for no reason at all. I think this airport left such a bitter taste in me that I would rather pay more to fly transit out of a more professional airport like Singapore Changi. In this airport, you have a poorly designed airport, mediocre facilities topped with some of the rudest staff I have ever witnessed in all of my traveling experience. The only redeeming feature here is good WiFi.",1.0

My baggage was there after a quick bathroom break and zero queue for the taxi. Checked in to depart around 3.00pm to no queues at either passport or security channels.

At 9.10am exit passport control and see an airport staff member with Finnair sign who advises me to run to plane. 75 minutes to clear passport control just not good enough and with no staff to assist you, 2 hours 25 minutes to check-in and clear passport control is a record for poor quality service from any airport and airline.

For its huge traffic and size there are no showers available (apart from the ones in the expensive lounges), the constant checking of passports and boarding passes (6 times from check in to boarding) is absolutely annoying and a waste of time.

Within the terminal the arrangement of the escalators is completely confused.",2.0

171,"This is a modern airport and since I first visited in 2011 the queues for both inbound and outbound immigration have improved massively but at certain times they can still be too long, yet several desks might be empty which adds to a passenger's frustration. After clearing immigration the noticeboards for baggage reclaim can be somewhat confusing and the airport management could do with adding more of these. Furthermore what is annoying is that the airport is very big in size with distances between piers large yet both in arrivals and departures there seems to be hardly any moving walkways and an airport this size could benefit from an automated people mover like at Hong Kong and Singapore Airport as it would make transit, arrivals and departures so much more comfortable and convenient for passengers, especially those arriving and departing from more remote gates. Nevertheless the choice of catering facilities is very good, although not quite up to the standard of Singapore Changi Airport. Also the terminal is very clean, well air-conditioned and a pleasant all-round ambiance. If the above issues were addressed it would certainly compete with Schiphol, Singapore and Hong Kong for being one of the world's best.",8.0
172,"Arriving from Singapore, Bangkok Suvarnabhumi absolutely pales in comparison. Air conditioning is not sufficient and the place feels overcrowded. Not enough facilities for longer waiting time such as comfortable seats with charging stations or other entertainment options.

Having learned this the hard way I will come better prepared next time.",2.0
173,"I am consistently amazed and saddened at the lack of any sort of forward planning (perhaps even forward thinking) by the management at BKK. The number of A380s arriving at BKK has been steadily increasing over the last year, yet there appears to be little if any increase in the number of gates modified to accommodate these large planes. Returning from a regular trip to Hong Kong two months ago on Emirates superb late evening A380 service, the aircraft was stuck on the ground for a full 30 minutes before moving to the gate. The reason? Another A380 was late departing. Last night was exactly the same scenario. After touch down, the delay was 25 minutes as the departure of a Thai International A380 was late. Yet TG aircraft are supposed to be parked at the East End of the terminal building whereas Emirates uses the West. With so many other gates unused at that time after many of the European and North Asia flights had departed, it is unbelievable that a supposedly major airport has not upgraded more of its gates to accommodate the increasingly popular A380s.",3.0
174,"Overall I would say this is a very nice airport by any standards. However those that have never being to Asia will really appreciate all the extra ""local"" touches to the décor that gives it a Thai personal touch. I have only traveled thru here once but it does not take long to get the lay of the land at this airport. However for those in Thai (Star Alliance) First Class be prepared for special pampering whilst checking in. You only have to go thru the special entrance on you are taken care of by the staff, no standing required, as they seat you in a comfortable lounge while they do all the work of getting your tickets and tagging and lugging you bags. Then a special Customs check and escort to your Royal Orchard lounge, which is the best lounge of any airport I have been to date. Happy travels thru this airport folks!",9.0
175,"Distances are long - but worst can be the immigration and security, especially on departure (on arrival you can decide to walk a km further to the next checkpoint). On a random Saturday night in February - it took us over 1.5 hours to clear immigration and customs (after spending an hour at check-in with Qatar, but this was not the fault of the airport).

177,This is a big airport. Check in desks are spread across a vast area so try to get your transport to drop you as close as possible to the right area to save having to carry bags long distances. Airline signs are on the pavements beside each entry area to guide you. After check in you have to go upstairs and then you have to go downstairs which seems strange. Past security airport is well signed. Food court is fairly cramped but offers a wide choice of cuisines. Shopping ranges from high end places through the full range but tends to be concentrated in one area. There are not enough seats outside the gate areas but once in the departure area there are lots of seats but not enough for an A380.,8.0
178,This airport was a surprise as we had heard that it was a difficult place to go through but we went through from gate to baggage claim in less than ten minutes. Immigration was quick and efficient. There are plenty of signs telling you where to go. Baggage claim was rather slow but was well signed. Connecting transport links were well signed the only difficulty was the need to go down moving walkways with luggage on wheels.,7.0
179,"When this Bangkok Suvarnabhumi opened less than 10 years ago, it was touted as a challenger to Singapore Changi. Has this ambitious goal been realized? I started using this airport about 3 years ago for some long-haul flights. First impressions in 2012 were generally (but not overwhelmingly) positive. Since then however its been all downhill. My most recent arrival/departure experience in early February 2016 travelling to the Middle East and UK from Australia has only confirmed this opinion. Firstly, it has a vast layout which means long walks to and from immigration to your gate. Check-in and outbound immigration is simple enough, but the opposite is true for arrivals where long queues are common and even premium 'fast track' lanes are easy to miss and sometimes just as full. Secondly, airport management has decided to cut corners by not having full airconditioning in the departures area. In many areas its muggy and sweat-inducing. Combine that with a glass ceiling in a sunny, humid tropical environment and you can guess what the result is. My departure/arrival times are usually in the evening and even then it's quite uncomfortable. Just imagine what sauna-like conditions daytime brings. Your only relief is to escape to the airline lounges but not everyone has this option. The look and general aesthetic of this airport is terrible. You can see exposed utility lines and bare concrete. Charitable reviewers might call this 'industrial chic' but the fact is this airport was done on the cheap and it looks it. If this airport were a house, you would call it 'builders grade'. Food options are varied and generally well priced. Duty free is expensive and best avoided. Staff are usually pleasant enough although communication can be a little problematic. Transport links to the city centre is not as advanced as KLIA and SIN. Overall, this airport is not one that I recommend for ease of use and personal comfort. Of the three major SE Asia hubs, I would rank this airport third behind Singapore Changi and Kuala Lumpur. And a very, very distant third place, mind you. You can do much better than BKK.",3.0
180,"This airport needs definitely to be refurbished. Although the airport is less than 20 years old, it is not up to the task.

That is very annoying as you have to walk a long way (East or West) to get your information, which might lead you to have to go back all the way in the opposite direction. On the positive side however, free wifi available everywhere in the airport (you just have to register). Queuing times for security clearance if you are in transit are short.",5.0

183,"Leaving this airport was a chore. All staff were rude in nature. The Emirates staff were rude checking in. The lady directing people to passport control found it very hard to give me a departure card without glaring at me. The card was already filled in before I could use it. The next lady who gave me a departure card gave me the same attitude but this time managed to give me a blank card. The passport officer was nice enough to notice I was in a bad emotional state because I was leaving my wife in the airport and processed me quickly with a smile. After this I had to try find my boarding gate because I had checked in early (was actually within the time limit but this is Emirates excuse). Went to ask a lady who works in security. She was as rude as the ladies in passport control. Blunt and rude. Next came the surprise. Went to the gate and waited for my late plane arrival. Asked about free WIFI to the bag checking people and they didn't have a clue or they couldn't be bother to help. When it came time to check my bag, they just looked at my bag, not inside it and asked if I had water inside. So much for security.

184,"Arrival at this airport is usually efficient enough. In the early morning my experience was very different. The passport control is stuck in the 1900's with all immigration done using paper only, because they had full staff working to check out Thai nationals and only 4 to check out tourists, the line took 3 hours to check out. In the meanwhile my wife was in heavy distress with worry. Next time share the staff between Thai's and tourists.

186,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi is a very nice airport. Construction is incomplete but the buses move quickly and efficiently between the planes and the gate. My only real complaint is the cab racket outside the airport. The fee I was quoted to Sukhumvit 18 was 1600 baht. I got it down to 1050 baht but the actual metered price is 390 baht including tolls. That's a mark-up of 269 to 410 percent. It's smarter to leave the airport in any way possible then getting a cab or take the amazing subway system.,8.0

Rostering extra staff to cope with peaks in traffic doesn't appear to be an option for the authorities - not a good introduction to a country if you have just stepped off a long-haul flight and just want to reach your hotel and relax.

There's a food court at Level 1 that serves affordable (cheap) local delights. So make sure you head there before your flight, or first stop after a long travel away from home (if you're Thai). It's air-conditioned and seldom packed full, although meal times may see a surge of customers. But that's ok. The restaurants are varied from local food to western hamburgers. Take your pick. It's a bit more to pay than in the town center. But hey, you're at an airport. So expect airport extras. Go for a spa massage if you've go time in your hands. Browse the bookshop. Shop.

I asked the information counter where Lao Airlines and I was directed to ""R"". All lanes are clearly marked. Check in was quick and smooth, Lao has plenty of staff and there was no one waiting. I then went over to the VAT Refund counter. I did not know you were supposed to have the items with you. Showed them photographs, and finally after some time my papers were stamped. I then proceeded upstairs to go through security. This was a little slower, but typical now at airports. I was told that a tube of sunscreen would not be allowed - it was a little larger than they allow, first time in 7 flights. Oh well, I went downstairs, back to check it it, was told I needed a box and was directed over to the post office in a corner where I could buy a box, back to check in. After that I had to go back through security, this time the line was longer. You then go Downstairs to go through immigration. It took 25 minutes to get through immigration and this was at 8.00 in the morning. All of the staff at the airport that I stopped to ask directions from, were kind and helpful and easy to find. After you go through immigration, you enter the terminal area through duty free shopping. I went straight to VAT Refund where again I had to show my passport (for the 5 time since I arrived at the airport) more scrutinizing, and finally got a refund in Thai Baht! VAT is a total waste of time, won't bother again. They make it difficult to receive. From VAT I went straight to the gate. All in all this took me 1 hour 45 minutes. Lots of walking and waiting! It seems to be fairly organized but allow plenty of time at this airport, and it wasn't even that busy when I got there. They do offer free wifi, but I didn't have time to use it.

BKK being one of the busiest airports in the world and tourism being a major industry in Thailand, all this is very shocking.",2.0
207,"I transited through this airport on my flight from Dubai to Christchurch. This meant getting off and back on same flight. On arrival we headed to transit and came across airport staff holding a card with our flight number who directed us to a certain area except when we got to that area we got sent back the other way. Very annoying. Only two queues for security checks so took ages. When I showed boarding pass to staff they couldn't see where I was going and rudely asked ""where you going"" once passed security check and at gate further searching of hand luggage this resource would have been better used at having more security X-ray lines open. Unlike other airports there were no shops at gates to buy anything if you wanted something. Getting wifi was impossible.",3.0
208,"I probably pass through BKK once a month. Immigration used to be a major delay but I've not waited more than 10 or 15 minutes over the past year. Baggage delays have never been a problem. Still plenty of touts cluttering up the Arrivals area and I don't like the 'new' taxi system but again it's not much of a delay. Check-In's seem reasonably efficient depending on the airline, but on international flights I always check in early (typically as soon as the check-in opens). Departure Security and Immigration are much better than before, with minimal delays. Seating in the Departures Area away from the Gates is not good, but one level down from the main concourse is much quieter and a good place to kill a couple of hours. Duty Free Shopping is over priced, and electronics are a waste of time - much better deals to be had in town. Bangkok Suvarnabhumi is a better airport than it was a few years ago, but nowhere near as good as Singapore, Hong Kong or Seoul.",6.0
209,"Almost 10 years on Bangkok airport continues to amaze me as being so middle of the road for Asia. When one compares Hong Kong and Singapore to Bangkok, Suvarnabhumi just comes up short in all areas. Its basically a shopping center for Kings Power outlets with very little comfort space, few toilets and long distances to walk without pedways. There are mostly greasy fast food outlets with few choices of healthy food. To get wifi you have to register at an information booth. Long lineups at immigration of up to 45 minutes make arriving and departing from this airport very disappointing.",5.0
210,"Arrived from Hong Kong on 9th June evening and had a very short time to catch next flight to Chennai. No electronic boards near arrival in terminal as renovation was going on. Walked further down to be directed by Airport personal to wrong side of departure gates. Had to walk back with family almost a kilometre or more just to
make it in time. Security personal did not allow perfume bought at Hong Kong airport and were extremely arrogant in behaviour even though I showed them the receipt, making me lose a couple of hundred US$. Will never take this route even for a flight change.",1.0
211,Queuing time when I got to Bangkok was non-existent (been to BKK twice before) waited maybe 10 minutes to go though to baggage belt. Was happy with the result. On the way back it was the same again waited 10 minutes to go though. Maybe it was a quiet period at the airport. Duty free prices were expensive expect to walk a lot and far.,9.0
212,On arrival longish walk to immigration there is a snake line then you are directed to another line for a passport desk there were many desks but only 4 or 5 open for non Thai. It felt that looking at the arrivals board later that 4 long haul planes arrives almost same time causing some delays but I have had worse waits. It felt that the bags arrived a container at a time so you had a lot of bags appear then a big gap and more appear then a gap with everyone looking at the same bags going round and so on. For departure arrived a bit early for check in already a long line then one person came and started checking people in after 20 mins or so more people drifted in. Security was a breeze to get through passport control however was a repeat in coming in 4 open desks 4 lines pick a line and hope. The duty free shops are very expensive for the gifts I looked at and was glad I got what looked like the same key ring for 70% less in a shopping center. The airport is very modern and clean if they could sort out passport control and the shop prices it could be a top 10 airport.,7.0
213,"Very poor passenger flow. Signs to TG and other airline lounges very poorly located. Signs are placed where passengers are not likely to see them. Staff give misleading directions. One ""helpful"" guy took me across from Concourse C to EFG although I wanted to go to the lounge in Concourse C. Worse still he abandoned me at EFG area. The Royal Thai Silk Spa and the airport trains were great but cannot compensate for poor basics.",1.0
214,Dreadful queues. My wife went for an extra good-bye to our grand-daughters and oh-so-nearly missed the flight. As they live in Bangkok we have no choice about the airport we use otherwise we would avoid it. Not much hint here of the so-called land of smiles.,
215,Immigration is much better than my last visit 3 years ago - a breeze on arrival but 20 minutes on departure with a poor hall design leading to crowding and pushing. As before the worst issue is the heavy use of buses instead of airbridges - 17 of my last 20 flights have used buses despite all being on Thai Air widebodies. This really affects its suitability as a transit or business hub and I prefer to avoid it now. Others aren't avoiding it - the terminals were packed and shop service has gone drastically downhill.,4.0
216,Me and my husband were shocked by the queuing time! Having arrived at the airport 2.5 hours before the flight (Bangkok-Kiev UIA flight PS 272 16/2/15) we caught our plane at the last minute! Only because we neglected all good manners and elbowed through the crowd of angry passengers at the passport control counter. The queues were horrible! First at the check-in then at the customs control and finally at the passport control. At the latter there were hundreds of people in a complete mess in a narrow corridor with only 3 counters open (out of 10+). The problem was that they gathered together all the international flights! We are frequent travelers but we have never seen such a mess before. We stood in a passport control line for an hour. I wonder how many passengers missed their flights that day.,
217,For a time after some of the low cost carriers were moved to Don Mueang airport the queuing times at BKK's Immigration were reduced to reasonable levels. At certain times of the day however they have now become horrendous again. Arriving on a Qatar A380 around lunchtime it took fully 1 hour 40 minutes to get through the Immigration and Customs lines. This is disgraceful. I fully accept that it does not help when two A380s two 777s and two A330s are scheduled to arrive at the West Immigration Hall in the space of less than 30 minutes. That would tax many airports. The real problem is the fact that even in the knowledge that so many passengers arrive at this time not all the desks were manned. Worse the staff who are supposed to help with the snake queuing system only make it worse when they close one or more and usher passengers into other longer queues. This resulted in several near fights. Automatic gates for Thai citizens was supposed to stop this nonsense. It hasn't!,2.0
218,Wheelchair Assistance. The last 18 months this service ahs changed for departure customers you do not get the chance to buy items in duty free anymore you get 30 mins at a Cafe then wheeled to a Gate with Toilets and no place to buy a drink for 2.5 hours before being collected 5 mins before boarding you are treated like luggage. Myself wife and friends have travelled to Thailand twice or three times a year for 20 years and only in the past 3 years needing wheelchair help this is now the last time we get this treatment and you no longer get purchases in duty free (due to staff) we travel to other wheelchair friendly countries.,3.0
219,As a regular user of BKK and other airports around the world BKK compares favourably to those airports. It may not be HKG or SIN but it certainly is better than most of the world's airports. Yes there are sometimes delays at immigration during peak arrival and departure times. Name an airport where that is not the case. I have always waited longer than at BKK when entering Canada the USA and many EU gateways. Security check lines move faster at BKK than those airports as well. When there are delays it is because of passengers who still try to bring forbidden items through or who are disorganized. Yes there can be long walks to and from gates but what do people expect at one of the world's largest airports? There are moving walkways escalators elevators wheelchair assistance and little carts to carry those who cannot walk The key advantage of the airport design is that one is not forced to change terminals. Transfers are a fraction of the time and without the hassles of the airports that have multiple terminals. It is easier to travel through BKK than comparably sized airports elsewhere. Airport restaurants are always expensive but BKK's costs are still far below those of airports in other countries. The lack of easy wifi access is a major deficiency but this is typical of most of SE Asia. There are multiple washrooms that are easily accessible and the washrooms are kept clean much cleaner than in the typical European or US airport. When there are problems with crowds it is usually caused by the tourist package flights which dump large amounts of passengers at one time and don't pay to staff up their baggage services. These package flights also fail to provide more than a few check-in counters causing the long lines for some at check-in. BKK gets the job done and the easy access to cheap high quality VIP bus services that can take a passenger to some of the resort destinations such as Hua Hin (-4 hours away) for 300 baht and elsewhere are a plus. The big problem at the airport has always been and continues to be the taxi /lLimousine service. The limos are over priced and the Taxis often refuse to use their meters. The need to fend off the transport mobsters who hang around the arrivals area continues to be annoying. This aspect of the airport does serious damage to Thailand's tourist sector and image. It needs to stopped.,8.0
220,"This is my sixth journey through Survarnabhumi this year and I have been through every corner of the airport. Like many other reviewers I find it a most annoying inconvenient and expensive experience. The ""Duty Free"" shops are very expensive and have obviously swallowed any duty with their greedy pricing: avoid them and buy elsewhere. The airport can be hot and stuffy in certain areas where aircon is inadequate. Airside food outlets are two to three times more expensive than the city e.g. 9baht soda water was 65baht. Better go to family mart outside immigration area where prices are normal. Also note that many flights require a bus ride across the tarmac because of inadequate terminal facilities. Immigration officers are expressionless. Forget taxis. Spend the extra money and book an airport limousine near the luggage carousel. You pay one fee - no rip offs extra cash for tolls and all that other nonsense you get with the (grossly underpaid) taxi drivers. I see little to no improvement since 2006 and recommend Singapore as a transit point to other Thai cities. Unless you need to go to this airport avoid it.",2.0
221,Ridiculous 1.2 km walk from Domestic-Arrivals gate to the transfer-desks and International-Departures gate no moving-walkways to help the elderly one has a choice of the endless walk past the duty-free shops and fast-food joints or level-3 with it's view of walkways running both ways but which you cannot access! Internet-access always seems to be unobtainable in reality. The early-days shortage of washrooms has now been addressed. The artwork is quite nice.,6.0
222,Hot Illogical Hot Illogical a lot of walking in circles - from the ground floor you go through a maze of escalators (not interconnecting). Somehow you make it to departures! Did I mention it was hot and then I need to make a comment for the long queues a lot of standing and a lot of waiting. It used to be good when you could clear immigration through different sectors but now are herded like cows through a central gate you are letting yourselves down Thailand! I love Thailand but so disappointing to have this last impression.,1.0
223,It has got a little better with some improvements. A spectacular garden which featured the theme of the royal barges was impressive. Shopping looked tempting. Some cafes were not that appealing and some were a bit over crowded. The train connectivity to the city is very good. Within the airport itself there needs to be more lifts between floors.,9.0
224,I've been a regular traveller (10-15 times/year) through Suvarnabhumi since it opened in 2006. It's a large airport and it's busy - always. Rule #1 - check in early. Rule #2 - if you have to wait for check-in baggage don't expect to be in a taxi less than 1.5 hours after landing. If you manage 45 mins you've done pretty well. Check-in can be slow but that's down to the airlines. (I always check-in online). Most of them seem to have enough counters available and international flights will typically be open 3 hours before Departure and occasionally 4 hours - so check in early. Upstairs Security Screening is usually only a few minutes wait I've never waited more than 10 minutes and I can think of many worse airports in this respect. Immigration both in Arrivals and Departures is poor and can be the longest wait of the trip through the airport but if you've allowed enough time it is what it is - chill and bring a book. The Baggage Hall is big enough belts are well sign posted and the longest I've ever waited on a bag was a Domestic Flight from Chiang Mai (about the same length of time as the flight). 20 mins in the baggage hall would be more typical. You very rarely get stopped in Customs and queuing times for taxi's is not bad. If you have to wait around there are plenty lounges Airside and seating in the lower levels both Landside and Airside. The Terminal Hotels are expensive and there are better options locally or in the city. Food is expensive and the choice isn't great but there is a food court Landside which is good value. (Burger King seems the busiest eating place). I rarely bother with Duty Free Shopping in BKK - I can shop better in the city. Distances to and from the gates are lengthy in some cases but they're pretty good at keeping the travelators working. Toilet cleanliness may not be at the standards of the best airports but they are cleaned regularly. Signs are OK and Flight Information Screens are very good. Touts still congregate in Arrivals and I still ignore them. The Airport Rail Link isn't the blast to and from the city which was envisioned but it works adequately. Unfortunately it's pretty overcrowded at peak times because of stops at intermediate stations. BKK is a better airport than it was 5 years ago but the Immigration 'experience' is poor and is a major bottleneck. Security is much better organised than before and the budget airlines moving to Don Mueang has taken some pressure off BKK. Given the space they have and passenger numbers they handle BKK should be a better airport than it is and as a passenger it's not a good airport to be in a hurry to get through. Lots of problems go away given enough time.,5.0
225,Terrible experience all round shame on them to treat people worse than cattle. Horrendous queue's at security and passport control with the latter having only half the desks staffed. It is the same arriving as well as leaving be warned avoid if possible!,
226,My worst airport experience. Took us 1 hr 30 mins to go through security on departure just five stations open and hundreds of people queuing. It's clear those in charge don't care about their customers. Airlines and any business in the tourist industry take note this will affect your business we certainly won't be coming back.,
227,I am creeping into my mid seventies now and I have found the business class flying in most airlines has improved over the past decade but the airports are becoming more and more of a nightmare every year. Taking the cake is this dreadful Suvarnabhumi Airport which stretches over a vast distance and has many areas without the walking machines. The distances are simply too long for many senior travellors and after more than a kilometre you arrive at the long queues at immigration and afterwards have to fight through crowds and up and down escalators to arrive at taxi lines. Hong Kong is only marginally better and in fact why do none of the airports give some attention to passengers who are getting on in years. I really detest the walking in BKK.,4.0
228,This airport is huge and we had to walk about 1100 m to transfer station. Yes it is exact 1100 m from C5 to E2. Before we can get to the transfer desk which is now located on the departure floor we had to pass the security control and without the boarding pass they do not let you in! It is horrible to find something to prove that you want to go to the transfer desk to get the boarding pass! How can someone keep changing the arrangement of the airport at least 10 times over the past 10 years.,3.0
229,Very disappointed. There is a serious lack of seating around gates D1-D8. I am seeing whole families sitting on the floor I also am sitting on the floor. Thailand reliance on tourism will be affected by the small thing its services fail to deliver while the rest of the world gets better at service the leader is failing.,5.0
230,"Departure from and returning to Bangkok from Hong Kong. I did mention that the airport is finally listening as there are some minor changes however compared to other airports in the region it is not a comfortable event leaving or arriving at this airport. Passport control is much better than before however waiting times remain longer than optimal and the overall ""attitude"" of the border officers (male and female) can be described as miserable and lacking tact in many ways. Being 10 years here I never touched the glorified tax free shopping as items are pricier than in the city. It's just not worth it at all. Food venues are pricey however there is a food court with great food on the ground floor before you pass immigration to the restricted air side. Walking distances are very long and I cannot imagine older passengers going all that way to reach passport control. Wifi never really worked so I am wondering whether its just for show. The train to the airport from the city discontinued the red express line for some reason (it had terrible frequencies as well - every 45 minutes so it beats the overall idea of having an express train). The local blue line is alright but used by many locals on the way so gets very packed and full in just a couple of stops. My main anger with this airport is its inability to control taxi drivers. They are wilder every time. Once you are seated and left the cab booth many tourists are faced with immediate requests of a set fare that is double or triple the taxi-meter price. In several occasions people were ""offloaded"" close to the highway as a result. I discernibly see those cab drivers getting to be a problem. If you only transit then I really suggest other airports in the region whether its Kuala Lumpur Singapore or Hong Kong with all offering a much more hassle free travel.",5.0
231,Horrible airport avoid it if you can. Cost cutting has increased the ambient temperature well into the uncomfortable range however you can find refuge in the cooler biz lounge. The customs officials are the most rude and unprofessional airport staff I've ever encountered. Arrived back late at night and airport was a building site.,
232,Very large airport lots of walking thought staff were quite unfriendly we had to get a connecting flight to Phuket transfer lounge was horrible uncomfortable seating and nowhere to grab a coffee. Very cold and unfriendly airport - couldn't wait to leave.,3.0
233,Too big too hot - have to walk for such a long distance of course crossing the 1km duty free area which is a bit too much. Not the best airport I have been if you compare with Singapore or Seoul.,4.0
234,So much walking needed (at least for transit passengers). Toilets all behind shops - pretty unclean compared to other airports. The seemingly modern facilities - lacking quality. Lots of places have only dark lighting. Lots of signs have incomplete information. Map slightly confusing. Not a lot of restaurants and interesting shops. Stingy food servings. At least service personnel were nice enough spoke good English. Waiting gates and the check-in procedures tedious uncomfortable. Free WiFi available required tedious registration. Only available showers are in Lounges - my one (CIP) provided only basic one for 350 Baht. The 2nd time I went to the better one next door which cost 1200 Baht complete with WiFi computers food drinks couches. Hope this place will be improved.,5.0
235,"Flew from Bangkok to Prague to Paris and back with AF. Being in Thailand for 10 years I have to say that the Airport seems to be finally listening and certain changes are visible to make life easier in this large airport. The excruciatingly long walks from gates to passport control still remains and something no one can do anything about. Certain airlines simply park way too far at the end of the concourse. Passport control officers are much faster even if they still lack common courtesy. They are more ""efficient"" nonetheless. The security (X-ray) staff are the ones needing an extensive training in politeness and customer care as they do treat passengers as cattle. I 100% ignore duty free in Bangkok airport since it cannot be called such when prices are higher than in the city.. food too overpriced as well with internet offered but not functional. If having the option to transit then I would strongly suggest KUL HKG and SIN if you have the choice. For the rest of us who simply have to fly from and to Bangkok it is not as bad as it used to be granted that I ""ignore"" most of this port's services simply check in and rush to gate and fly. Land go through passport control and catch a cab rarely anything in between.",6.0
236,It's embarrassing to see just how bad BKK has become. I use BKK at least 2-4 times a month and aim to spend as little time and money in the place as possible. Check-in for TG business class is the only good thing about the place (however the TG lounge is worn out and offers snacks I wouldn't feed the dog) Duty Free is not only more expensive than other major duty free shops in Asia it's more expensive than downtown Bangkok. The toilets are disgusting even the new ones. The F&B outlets are all very low quality yet charge high prices. The car park doesn't accept credit cards - it's cash only and you don't even get a receipt. And if you're unfortunate enough to use the public taxi's beware the same old scams are still in force (in August 2014).,
237,"Arrived and departed BKK in July and had an overall good experience at the airport. Have been here several times over the past 5 years and have noted significant improvement. The grey ""industrial"" appearance is not attractive and is a poor welcome to Thailand. However murals are nice more and better toilets and the shopping area is much better although with outrageous prices. Long long walks from gates to terminal with the ""people movers"" having an annoying voice at the end of each segment. Baggage and check-in/check-out were good and efficient. Passport control is still the worst - surly unfriendly robotic staff with no sense of humanity - welcome to the ""Land of Smiles""! Security was a minor frustration they confiscated a small bottle of Johnson's Baby lotion. All in all a reasonably good airport but not on par with other airports in Asia certainly not ""world class"" standard.",7.0
238,Arrived in Bangkok on 25th May and passed through as a transit passenger on 8th June. Very large airport - lots of long walks even with the people movers. Arrival experience very good with luggage arriving almost as soon as we were at the baggage belts. Transit on 8th June was more problematic. We were given a sticker to wear when checking in at Koh Smui and at Bangkok were to follow signs showing the same symbol as our sticker. Only problem was that some of the signage is far from clear several staff who we asked were unsure one even directing us to the right gate but to where arrivals were processed when we eventually found the right route 300 people were kept locked out of the gate and had to stand or sit on the floor in a corridor. When the gate opened there were only two staff (with 4 watching) checking boarding passes (which were checked again prior to boarding).,7.0
239,Can skip the free airport wifi which is unstable and most of the time poor wifi signals. Recommend to go to any of the restaurants or cafe in the airport if you need to access to Internet.,5.0
240,I've been travelling through Bangkok maybe a dozen times a year since the airport opened and there's definitely improvements. There's not much seating in Departures so it's best to arrive around the time your check-in opens (typically 3 hours with International Flights). I always check-in online for shorter queuing times. The upstairs security screening is reasonably efficient as is Immigration with somebody usually managing the queue system. Check-in early and kill time airside rather than checking in late and having to rush. I don't bother with Duty Free in BKK - it's expensive as are all the airside restaurants. There's not much seating in the main concourse but there are quiet areas 1 level down and obviously out towards the gates. Arrivals usually commences with a log walk from a remote gate but plenty travellators to help you on your way and highly variable queuing times for Immigration 20 minutes would be typical most times of they day but an hour not unusual at busy times. The baggage is pretty efficient in BKK and it's unusual to have to wait more than a few minutes for luggage. Plenty of taxi touts in Arrivals but just follow the signs downstairs for Public Taxi or Airport Rail Link. Also the lower levels are quieter if you have to spend a few hours between flights. There's also a food court with better Thai food than the airport restaurants. Now they have Security Screening out of the way upstairs in Departures the whole flow of the airport has improved. With enough Immigration Desks open fewer bottlenecks and some carriers moving to Don Mueang BKK is a better airport than it was a few years ago.,7.0
241,Excellent clean and efficient. Immigration can be a bit slow at times due to the volume of people (make sure you complete your immigration card on the aeroplane). The walk from the plane to immigration can be over 1 km but travellators take care of 50% of this. Check in faster with Thai than Emirates. Head down to level one at the far end there is a small food court where for 100Baht you get a decent meal or head upstairs and pay premium. Once through emigration the drinks prices are inflated example 200 ml juice at 7/11 is usually 18 THB in Bangkok you pay 50 THB for same product here. Wifi free via a code ( collect on LHS after emigration ) but poor connection. Finally decent viewing facility up stairs on level 7 if you like watching planes. A good airport!,9.0
242,Very nice design but that's it very long walk to immigration long queue and only a few immigration counters open for a few hundred passengers spent over 1 hour in the queue. Immigration staff very unfriendly you don't feel welcome in Thailand. Airport staff don't speak English illegal taxi drivers always harass you to offer a ride. Duty free is fine but belong to the same company so prices are higher for many things than in town. think twice before purchasing. Smoking rooms are tiny.,2.0
243,"I can't understand the number of rather negative reviews of Suvarnabhumi. Remembering the purpose of airports for my money I think the airport functions well as a means to transport masses of people. I travel through the airport on a regular basis and for the most part - find it clean  efficient and comfortable. Signage is clear and informative. Security and Immigration is efficient and staff friendly enough - some even taking the time to smile and have a little joke with you. There are a lot worse airports out there - in supposedly ""developed"" countries.",8.0
244,"Took the ""airlink"" downtown to Makesan terminal: a waste of time as I then switched to a taxi which just got stuck in traffic.

Otherwise just take a taxi all the way from the airport this airlink makes very little sense.",3.0
245,Horrible staff at the airport. Almost all of them very unhelpful and rude to passengers. Never again with Thai Airways or via Bangkok.,

247,Flew into Bangkok from Tokyo and was very impressed by the airport. Very modern and very nice inside. It's enormous. Nicely decorated. Had no troubles getting through customs getting bags was easy. No problems at all.,9.0
248,Unfriendly custom stuff very difficult to follow signs very old lounges with unsmiling girls inside smoking rooms are small and dirty we felt like prisoners or criminals.,2.0
249,Good points: Quite new and big good design with good choice of food. Not so good points: Long walking distance (800 m between centre points plus additional up to 500 m to the gate). No sign board for departure time at arrival gates so you do not know in which direction to go if you go to the right direction it will be approx. 600 m if wrong direction then you might go up to 1300 m). Not enough air bridges for all big aircraft's (A330) like the one from and to Hanoi hence you have to take shuttle bus.,3.0
250,Returned from a family vacation to Thailand 10 days ago and must say passport control was hassle free on arrival en-route to Phuket but can't say same for departure after spending a 3 day stop over in Bangkok. My son was pulled away from counter by a supervisor without explanation or even an attempt to say why while my husband was just as delayed by the same officer at the counter before being let through. All this even though travelling as a family of 4. Kept fiddling with his passport and ticket then their computers and eventually stamping son's passport still not responding to our request for an explanation. Duty free very expensive. Will most likely go back if only I could understand what happened.,8.0
251,Good aspects: told where to collect your luggage without needing to ask. Bad aspects: immigration clearance slow food quite expensive.,6.0
252,I have read other reviews. My experience of Suvarnabhumi is that it is neither better or worse than other airports. I agree that sometimes delays going through immigration can be lengthy; so I travel into BKK business class and am fast tracked through the arrival procedures. The business lounges are relaxing and excellent. I have eaten in the airport - not great but it's filled a gap. I do not agree that toilets are filthy it's not my experience. I find staff very helpful but I speak Thai. I travel to Thailand many times and usually the immigration officer says welcome home. I would agree that the airport is very busy and there can be a lengthy walk to Immigration.,8.0
253,All in all a typically large and busy airport where you should expect to allow plenty of time for formalities. Once inside it takes a while to orient yourself but the gates are easy to find. It took me some time to realise that the main shopping area was on the upper floor. Shopping on the lower floors is scarce. Prices are not cheap and the toilets are a little unclean during busy times. On arrival we had to take the bus from the aircraft to the terminal but on departure we used a skybridge which is much more convenient.,8.0
254,Arriving was fairly good but on the way back the queuing to go through immigration was be on ridiculous waited about an hour to get through immigration. The place is very big and very expensive for duty free.,5.0
255,Flown in twice in the past few weeks. Queues for Passport/Immigration have become ridiculous. Earlier this year the queues zig-zagged out of the arrivals hall and down the ramp. Thought this was a one off issue having used the airport many times previously and never experienced any real problems. Not so. It is now the norm. Took in excess of 1 hour 30 mins in queues on both occasions just to get to the Immigration/Passport desk. Once at the desk all formalities completed in a couple of minutes. The reason for the huge queues is that very few Immigration desks are manned. Officers are employed to look at the queues and then disappear only to emerge minutes later to do the same again. eparting was so much faster. A real breeze. It appears that BKK is heavily promoting the paid for fast track arrivals coupon for THB850. I'll avoid BKK and go elsewhere rather than endure such nonsense again.,3.0
256,I think reviews of this airport depend on arriving or departing. I've rarely had difficulties flying out of Bangkok although I do make sure I'm there well in advance of my flight times. This is a very busy airport and always seems crowded due in my opinion to the lack of seating which leads to people walking up and down the concourse while waiting for their gates to be confirmed the duty free is very expensive and most of the shops seem to offer the same range of goods. The choice of food is quite good although the eating area again tend to get very crowded as people linger long after they've finished their meals just to have somewhere to sit. As all my flights are with Qatar I know which gates are usually used I have a Qatar Privilege Club Silver card so I can check in at the business counter and usually get a fast track pass and invitation to one of the Thai business lounges. Perhaps I'm just lucky in the fact that Qatar seem to have very efficient ground staff it's a pity they can't organise the arrivals also.,8.0
257,"This is a beautiful looking airport but it is very poorly designed. It takes forever to reach your gate (if you can find out which gate to go to - information is almost impossible to find about departures). When you reach the ""gate"" there is no organized boarding process  just a great swarming. And then instead of boarding your flight you board a bus to take you to the vicinity of your plane. Probably the most frustrating airport experience I have had.",2.0
258,It is quite cumbersome not to be able to deplane/depart directly onto a jetway but have to walk down/up steps with luggage onto a bus and vice versa. Found shops did not sell unique merchandise from Thailand.,4.0
259,Always fly C or F class. No problems. Exit airport always within 25 minutes to my taxi.,10.0
260,Arriving transiting and departing BKK Suvarnabhumi is no problem in 9 out of 10 cases. The airport is generally well organised restrooms are kept clean at normal times and shopping is ok however pretty expensive. 1 out of 10 cases might be where something goes wrong especially at peak-times. Staff are always around with some restrictions. It's a global airport with global passengers. Food is available everywhere. Rather long distances (huge airport) have to be taken into consideration. Immigration and security control can be a hassle but in 9 out of 10 cases it is ok.,6.0
261,For a relatively new airport BKK is a dismal failure. We could not check in for our flight so we had to wait five hours and there is little to do with poor restaurants and few shops. Once you get past immigration which is unable to cope there is not much else. I have travelled through BKK a number of times and I simply do not enjoy and will try and avoid but as a major international hub that may be difficult.,4.0
262,Airport a bit messy toilets filthy and although shopping is quite good shops are quite far from gates - I almost end up missing my flight. Overall airport okay.,5.0
263,I had to travel through this airport 4 times and every time I had to ask for directions to my gate. Expect long walks and if you happen to sit closer to your gate there are no food or beverage kiosks. On top of it all the rest rooms were filthy all the 4 times I went through this airport. Also don't expect the restaurants and shops to accept all the major currencies. This time they declined to accept Australian dollars. Each shop has its own exchange rate.,3.0
264,Nothing really improves at this appallingly designed airport . After being cooped up in a plane for 10 12 or even 14 hours it is too much to have to walk up to 2 kilometres to immigration which can not cope with the increased arrivals to BKK. They now boast the second largest number after London. For passengers like myself who are over 70 years old it is very difficult to walk so far on hard cement but this airport is the worst even surpassing the enormous distances one has to walk in MIA. The airport is a jumble inside and outside and I always pray that my gate is close to immigration but it never is. One terminal stretching for miles simply does not work for passengers.,1.0
265,Well a modern airport with so-to-say-top-notch facilities. In fact very disappointing. Long queues no logic in the building very difficult for orientation. When you have a connecting flight it is unclear where you need to walk (left or right) upon leaving your incoming aircraft. Not enough information screens and overloaded information counters. Extremely long walkways make you do good exercise but do not connect you in any way comfortably. This is the world's most disappointing airport vs. the expectations you may bring to see.,2.0
266,I will not use this airport again staff were unfriendly and not in the least helpful they just grunted and pointed in which ever direction they wanted to send you which was usually wrong. Not impressed either by the fact that the male staff didn't like dealing with me (female passenger) I very soon gave up trying to be nice to any of them which is very sad.,1.0
267,My least favourite airport. Surly and unfriendly. Poor food. Long distances to walk. I try to avoid if I can.,2.0
268,"Used this airport 3 times in the last 10 days. Overall I am not impressive for what should be a new airport in Bangkok. The entire airport looks unfinished with a sterile ""loft"" like look reserved for trendy buildings in the inner city- not a major international airport. Arrivals was easy with little to no wait in immigration and bags came out fairly quickly. On departure side staff helpful with only a few minutes wait in security. Shops were decent but few eateries of low quality. Boarding for each flight was a big production particularly for commuter flights.",4.0
269,Have used this airport many times. I have always noticed that the treatment at security is too excessive and does not give the impression of being at all friendly. All impressions that Thailand is a friendly country is lost due to the behaviour of security.,3.0
270,Recently travelled back to Thailand and on arrival there were already ridiculous queues at passport control! Took over an hour just to get through and by the time I got to the baggage claim belt they were already putting bags through from another flight from Dubai which landed an hour after mine! BKK need to be more efficient when it comes to handling passengers! However despite being an enormous airport I'd say it's fairly easy to navigate around (well signposted etc) and fairly clean. Journey out of BKK was a bit of a nightmare the woman at the check-in desk was quite rude. I was looking around for the resealable bags for the liquids in my hand luggage and none were to be found despite various empty desk slots for them and signs reminding you about the security procedure. Tried asking airport staff and they were completely useless. Decided to go through with it and by the X-Ray machine there was a stack of them! Luckily security and passport control went a little smoother and staff seemed friendlier. Plenty of shops in departure lounge which was nice but departure gate was such a long way from security! Then at departure gate- plane was delayed and passengers weren't informed until about half an hour after scheduled flight time! Overall not such a great experience this time. Hopefully next time it'll be better.,3.0
271,We recently travelled via Bangkok by Thai Airways on the transit to Delhi. This is our second time in 4 years though we prefer usually travelling Singapore Airlines. This is a pathetic airport staff cant speak or understand English rude duty free staff again cant speak anything other than local language. I am not even visiting the country but transit I expect the airport to be of a better standard. Long queues in security check in they make you go through it all over again even for transit travellers just getting from one gate to another in level 3. Overall the standards were pretty average. Would never recommend even bothering to visit this country or airport.,2.0
272,I was on my way to Dhaka and landed in BKK 3 hours early. On my boarding pass issued there was no gate number printed and I found it as C 4A from the information boards. Finally I found at the eleventh hour that the gate had been changed and now it was gate F which is almost more than 2 km from the gate I was staying. Rushed to the new gate and ran like nothing to catch the flight and they said that the gate was closed. Like to bring up following: Though I was telling all those security people that I was on the way to the new gate they never let the airline know that. Searching for a lost passenger was not at all effective by airport staff and even at supervisory level nobody speaks English.,7.0
273,This airport is mediocre since it is newly built for 45 Mil. passenger per year it still has no room for a A330 from Hanoi. We still have to travel by bus during rain or sun mostly in the heat with small children or babies. The lounges are good. Safety check is long and time consuming. Immigration can be long but good if you have small children. Immigration for domestic connection is very good and friendly.,3.0
274,"Living in Thailand for 9+ years. Flew to and from Moscow SVO with Aeroflot. Check in is usually painless. It is the airline's responsibility to offer baggage drop off. The transportation to the airport is OK. taxis are cheap and in case you have only 1 luggage the train is OK even though the ""City Terminal"" at Makkasan is still non functional after being opened for more than 3-4 years. No check-in in the city just a large vast empty terminal to catch the train. Departure passport control and check is usually good and fast. Arrivals is always a pain an its really hit and miss. My last Arrival took me only 20 minutes but the Moscow flight 55 minutes. Officers are still too gloomy and treat arrivals like cattle. The biggest minus in this airport is the huge walking distances to passport control. Please fix the free wifi. Not sure I can recommend this large concrete colourless airport for layovers. I would definitely avoid it in favour of HKG SIN and ICN and even KUL.",6.0
275,The airport is clean signage is clear and did not have a very crowded feel. Plenty of seating and decent amenities.,9.0
276,One of the worst airports to transit in with very long walks and signs that are confusing. Pity that TG has extremely affordable premium class fares because their home airport is a really difficult to navigate and usually leave me with a sore ankle having to trek from one end to another end of the airport.,3.0
277,Airport was large and spacious however a few problems: Passport control boasted really long queues both times when I was arriving and departing staff need to be more humble - some staff at the duty free shops were condescending and rude.,5.0
278,Arrived at 12 noon on 25th May 2013: huge queues at immigration with what must have been thousands of passengers. Not all the immigration desks were open and this meant queues going back to the arrival gates. I thought they had put more staff on duty but that must have been a short lived thing. How can a government promote tourism but ignore fundamental services to those tourists! The airport needs to get it's act together.,
279,Entering BKK has become better depending on the time of arrival. I arrived afternoon and had almost no queues. Baggage delivered within 35 minutes of arrival. Departing was another story. The security screening followed by a rather chaotic passport control. However overall the airport has certainly improved to acceptable standards.,6.0
280,My wife and I travelled on 17 January 2013 from Brussels via Doha on Qatar Airways. Our flight to Bangkok from Doha was delayed and we had a connecting flight to Brunei the next morning. Arrived at Bangkok with almost 25 minutes to spare. Bangkok airport staff waited for us (I had asked colleague earlier to inform RBA about our delay and request assistance). Upon arrival airport/airline staff waited and rushed us to the RBA gate. We got onto RBA with just few minutes delay. Staff informed us that our bags would be sent to Brunei Airport the next day. We got our bags two days later.,10.0
281,I have flown into and out of BKK about 12 times in the last three years. Never had an unpleasant experience. The worst thing I can say about BKK is that it is very large. Some US airlines get the gates at the ends of the concourses making for long walks to the gate or immigration. Also depending on the type of aircraft occasionally deplaning using airstairs is required. Everything else about this airport is outstanding. At BKK I usually arrive between evening to late night and leave early morning or late night. The waiting time at security immigration and baggage claim has always been excellent. Check in wait has been good too with SkyPriority. Another feature of BKK is the positioning of the business-class lounges near the departure gates. With only a one or two minute walk to the gate you can stay in the lounge and work or relax right up to or even after boarding time.,10.0
282,Arrived at Suvarnabhumi on Friday 19 April from Amsterdam at 06.40 am deplaned walked 350 metres to immigration control picked up my baggage and exited the airport at 07.10. Very Good experience this time just hope they can keep it up.,9.0
283,We recently travelled through Bangkok Suvarnabhumi airport to and from Melbourne. I was very impressed with the standard of the airport. Moving through customs and baggage collection was very easy and efficient. The staff at the airport were helpful and information available made movement round the airport and connecting flights simple and easy.,9.0
284,Different experience depending on the time of arrival and departure. Upon arrival on Friday afternoon the queues for immigration were very long and many of the desks closed. Took around half an hour to get through which after a long 11 hour flight is poor. Going out on Saturday early morning it took over an hour and a half to check in go through security and then immigration. Once through we had to run to the gate to ensure we made our flight. The shops were empty - presumably because everybody was late for their flights! Coming back in was terrible - 45 minutes to clear immigration again hardly any desks open. Finally Saturday mid- morning leaving was bearable. Security less busy and actually friendly immigration with most desks open - such a contrast. I would hate to be an elderly person going through this airport. It must be so stressful.,2.0
285,It's an ok airport nothing fancy (except for the terminal buildings). Security slightly tight but that's ok since it was understandable. One thing I liked was that the airport made a prayer room for us Muslims to pray in. I would like to visit this airport again.,7.0
286,I was pre-warned about the length of time taken at immigration but at midday Sat 23rd Feb. it was an absolute breeze from entering the airport to arriving at the departure lounge less than 25 minutes. I wish every airport was as efficient.,9.0
287,I transited through the Suvarnabhumi airport on my Sydney - MAA leg and during the return leg. Though the airport is modern and has the requisite facilities it gives an impression of being an unfinished article. For some strange reason when my flight from Sydney landed in BKK they used the bus to transport the passengers to the terminal. Though the staff are friendly they barely speak English which is surprising given the tourist arrivals in Thailand. I had to ask 5 different people before I could locate a place to charge my phone and laptop.,5.0
288,Modern airport easy to get to and from. The airport is easy to use and get about. Its cool and airy the toilets were always cleaned. The arrivals taxi rank is well administered with Taxi drivers under a constant watchful eye. Food is high quality and cheap. And a good duty free on the exit route home. Emigration/passport control (arrivals and departures) had two queue. Staff were quick to use all lines when it got busy. I was slightly worried to see poor line discipline at the metal detectors where the one lady with a hand held paddle seemed to be overwhelmed. But a good experience.,9.0
289,I had the pleasure of using the business class facilities here just a few days ago. I have noticed that Suvarnabhumi now makes arriving passengers disembark to the runway and get on a bus which then takes them to directly underneath immigration. I am not sure why this is but it happened twice on this trip (arriving from Melbourne and arriving back from Mumbai). I understand the distances in Suvarnabhumi are quite large between gates and immigration but this strikes me as overkill. Anyway without the long distances at arrival the journey through was comfortable on both arrivals. From plane to luggage belt in 30 minutes. I don't expect courtesies from immigration so never surprised if they are rude. And then quickly over to Novotel pickups and to the airport. I arrived at about 5am both times which appears quieter and the airport handles the queues quite well. Business class departures are very pleasant with a separate check-in section separate baggage screen and separate immigration then the lounge right ahead. The lounge was very good compared to Melbourne's Air New Zealand lounge and good range of foods and drinks. Of course still have to walk to the gate and with Suvarnabhumi that was the opposite end of the massive airport (business class lounge is near A/B/C wing I was departing both times at E wing. No travelators to help here. Just long walks. Couldn't find a trolley either so the walk was long. Finally to the other smaller business class lounge and then onto the plane. All up a very nice feeling and travel. I know economy is not so convenient but somethings are the same (such as the very long walks).,8.0
290,This airport is not bad but there are still many design mistakes. Not enough space for security checks hence they have to take the floor space near the elevator to do it. We came with a big aircraft (A330) from Hanoi we had to take a bus to the airport where you have to run with all other guests to your gates which is sometime not clearly indicated. Design is new but A/C system seems not to cope with the heat.,8.0
291,Have been a frequent visitor to the airport. Although there have some improvements I feel that they have been cosmetic. The feel of the building is still unfinished and looking tired. Immigration still remains a nightmare with long lines. Baggage waiting times are very inconsistent its more of a waiting game especially during peak hours. The departure area s are over crowded and messy with insufficient seating. Security control remains a joke with rude and unfriendly staff.,2.0
292,I have travelled to BB at least 30 times over the last 3 years. The airport itself is nice but Immigration lines are a nightmare. In best case assume 1 hours in worst case 3-4 hours especially at arrival. December 2012 they now have an automatic passport for Thai nationals. So Thai nationals can get through in 1 minute. But tourists may have to wait 2-3 hours. Latest was yesterday at 3 o clock in the morning. I waited more than 2 hours. Automatic passport control for Thai nationals. And they assigned the same amount of passport gates for Tourists. Not even considering that the percentage of Tourists is probably 90% whereas the number of Thai's travelling was around 10%. So the airport invested a lot of money for bringing down the time for Thai's from 4 minutes to 1 minute instead of focusing on the real problem which is just getting worse and worse!,
293,"Beautiful but terribly designed airport. Departures is a mess. Arrival by taxi is confusing and have to cross a road to the gates where no cars give way. Check in isn't clear and is often a mess of queues with no staff control. Once you check in there is no clear direction to go. You end up going right up a little ""side way"". Arrivals is even worse. First you get confused where you've got to go. I saw many people coming back on themselves. Immigration is confusing with the signage. Immigration is quite fast (one positive). Getting your bags is badly organised and not clear where to go. Coming out of the gate which way do you go? If you go left the people waiting for you won't see you going right is the correct way to go and then you just hit a wall of people waiting. Food upstairs - not great over priced and I imagine in the position it is that the profits are not maximized by the number of people in the airport. Taxis - official taxi rank isn't clear or easy to find when first arriving. Unofficial taxi rank outside at arrivals is full of taxi drivers trying to scam you. Why is this not controlled? Terrible airport. Really badly designed. Nothing makes sense.",2.0
294,Arrival - Fine experience even after 30+ hours en route from the US. It only took five minutes to clear immigration. The bags took awhile to arrive but this just meant that I had time to exchange money at one of the many (competitive) vendors in the arrivals area. Departure - Horrible airport. It hard to believe that it is only six years old. The design seems like something from another era. Up through security I have no major complaints but then the entire experience really goes downhill. The first priority does not seem to be getting you to your gate but rather making sure you are exposed to every single one of the very high end shops. I did not see one newsstand or bookstore anywhere although I did finally see a great drugstore. There are some normal food options toward the end. The gate situation could not have been designed by anyone who travels much. You sit outside the gate area in a place with few seats until shortly before boarding. It is a crowded miserable experience. Your boarding cards are submitted as you enter the (secure) gate area where more seating is available. It is odd to have precious little seating where most people wait. I read that they are trying to make this airport one of the top ten in the world but there is just no way.,4.0
295,Fabulous airport. Soaring high roofs check in was a breeze. We flew EVA Air. I had the best meal I'd eaten at an airport and the prices were low for a major international airport. Great shopping too with reasonable prices. If I have one minor complaint it's that the actual departure gate area is bland and boring compared to the rest of the airport you should only go to the departure gate when it's close to boarding time.,10.0
296,The airport is huge sometimes that is nice and sometimes a nightmare if you are short on time. We has a nice experience when changing flights from HYD-BKK to BKK-HKG but the return was not so comfortable. Had 85 minutes between flights but the HKG-BKK was 25 minutes late and the long walk ways we literally had to run with half-asleep kids. But the airport is clean signage is clear and did not have a very crowded feel. Plenty of seating and decent amenities.,6.0
297,Large airport - there are some gates to this airport that mean you have a long walk to get to them. This means going past lots of shops - like being in a mall. Not fair on the passengers. If you like shopping - a big choice also nice places to eat. There are places to sit and rest. Allow enough time to get to gates. Toilets are plentiful. Has a tall high roof and feels huge and airy.,9.0
298,I've been fairly critical of BKK in recent years but there is a marked improvement in the Immigration and Security arrangements over the past few months and queuing times are better since the Budget Carriers have moved to Don Muang. The new Security Area upstairs is quick and efficient (5 mins). There are now better arrangements in both Arrivals and Departures Immigration (10 mins and 5 mins) in early evening which a few months was anywhere up to an hour or more. There also seem to be more Immigration Officers on duty now. The Check-in areas and Baggage Halls have never been a problem. The Airport is desperately short of seating areas away from the Gates. Overall BKK is better than a year ago.,5.0
299,This must be the worst designed most poorly organised 'modern' airport in the world. Only 6 years old but apparently from a design 40 years old and it shows. 40 years ago air travel was different fewer people fewer flights more time to shop if you wanted to. That is not the case today. It is designed as a shopping mall with plane parking on the end it does not have enough space for immigration or security checks. Huge distances to walk to and from the planes.,2.0
300,Arrived late at night mentally preparing for the customary long lines at immigration. At that time it was usually very busy with flights coming in from the USA and Korea. When I got to the immigration hall I joined a line with just one person in front if me. Has the message finally got through? I will know in December!,4.0
301,BKK airport is a work in progress. It has improved over the years but it is still essentially an overpriced shopping mall. What annoys me the most are not lines for immigration and security - waiting times have improved and the times where one had to wait in line for over an hour for immigration seem to be over. However it's the small things that annoy me such as uneven air conditioning throughout the airport help staff that does not properly speak English long walks to and between gates and unannounced changes such as the closure of parts of the arrival floor to non-passengers.,4.0
302,My first use of BKK Suvarnabhumi was on its opening day. It remains a mid-tier airport. Assets include airy architecture in much of the facility (but this is no better than many of its contemporaries) rail access and a few land-side services such as banking and phone kiosks. Deficiencies include signage informative literature {maps etc.} for newly arrived passengers inadequate capacity leading to queues of aircraft and passengers on many occasions and tedious access to and from distant gates. The airport has not yet solved the excessive influence of King Power on facilities quality and pricing. For example it's better to eat at the airport Novotel than at most tenants in the airport. Suvarnabhumi remains an unfinished project - even though at age 6 years its capacity has already been exceeded and strained. Would I recommend this airport? Maybe no maybe yes. Personally I often find better availability of long-haul connectivity to/from other airports in the region thus often go there - sometimes making the short connecting hop to/from BKK by low cost carrier.,5.0
303,I have been travelling in and out of this airport for many years now. Has greatly improved in regards of seating inside the international terminal. Customs and baggage retrieval very good both arriving and departing. Still somewhat lacking in terms of food inside the international section. Still though very much improved from initial opening. Hope they can keep up the improvements.,7.0
304,This was my first time back through Suvarnabhumi in 3 years. The improvements are noticeable. It's still one of if not the largest airport in the world. The airport has an abundance of eating places and facilities all of which are pretty good. It is a long distance from the plane to immigration. However there are travelators for those that don't want to walk. Immigration is efficient and quick. Baggage claim is pretty straight forward. When departing it is a short distance to the check in desks and plenty of free luggage carts are available curbside. I found check in to be easy and efficient although there were 4 of us and 8 bags. Departure security was somewhat clumsy but there are pleasant attendants. Departure lounges are spacious and comfortable especially since they replaced the hard plastic seats with cushioned seats. All in all I would say that this airport has come a long way from when it first opened and it is now one of the better airports I've been through.,9.0
305,Architecturally it is a beautiful airport and I should also remark that the direct train to the city is fast and cheap. However it is badly planned and poorly designed. As many have already remarked not only are the queues long and the walks endless but the gate design is illogical and the signage poor. Staff seem to resent working in this environment and most of them are unfriendly and unsmiling.,3.0
306,A quick trip for 2 weeks BKK-Prague-BKK. Check in was smooth as usual especially when you are web- checked-in otherwise expect a long line. Passport control is again different there is an escalator to an upper floor where you go through security check first once you go through you loop around and go down again to the ground floor to the new passport control (much smaller area than before which could cause trouble in rush hours). This would ensure that non passengers could see or reach the passport control area. The re-entry office is there again after several years and its a welcome. Passport control was OK but still not that quick they have their average days and much worse days. Duty free and food is a joke and never use them. Simply overpriced and nothing special. Gates are barren grounds with nothing but grey around. Boarding is a so so experience but ample seating for all which can be a problem in other airports. Transportation is good.,7.0
307,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport was meant to be one of the best in Asia. But as things have turned out it is one of the many middle class airports without a soul and without any chance to beat the 4 and 5 star airports in the region. The airport is not that old but it looks like it is very old! The main problem is the long walks for most transit passengers and the huge crowds waiting to stamp their passport in front of the tired- looking immigration officers. I would also mention the horrible prices of anything you buy at the airport. Often double the price of buying the same item in Bangkok. Compared to Singapore and Hong Kong; Bangkok har a long way to go to present a 5 star airport.,3.0
308,For a newer airport it's amazing how poorly designed it is. I was shocked at the lack of thought put in to the layout. The automated check-in machines don't work. No power ports anywhere it looks like they originally had them but they have all been removed. No free wifi which even regional airports have nowadays. The line managers at passport control were busy chatting with each other and provided no direction at all. This resulted in lines moving at half speed. I literally cant think of a single good thing to say about this place other than I'm leaving it.,3.0
309,After all the reported delays at Immigration starting early June BKK is now experiencing 4 months of aircraft delays. The Thai Airports Authority is closing each runway for 8 weeks for strengthening and resurfacing. Wide-body jets can only use one runway whilst single aisle aircraft can take off from both but only land on one. My Emirates flight from HKG was delayed 15 minutes on take-off whilst waiting for a landing slot and then stacked twice prior to landing ending up with another 30 minute delay. One United flight ex-NRT had to be diverted to Don Mueang when it became low on fuel. If Gatwick's single runway can be in the middle of an 8-month similar exercise and yet remain open for flights virtually throughout what is really wrong with BKK's runways that requires them to be closed to most aircraft for such a lengthy period?,3.0
310,Flew in late May flew out early June. As per other recent comments both the immigration has improved since my last visit with only a handful of people queued at any booth - inbound this was at a peak period as well. My luggage appeared promptly on the inbound as well within 10 mins of clearing customs. I did notice the exchange rate was much poorer in the airport for some reason which is something to be aware of. The main improvement that now needs to be looked at is the lack of good quality public area seating post immigration here.,8.0
311,It seems like the airport are finally responding to the negative comments around some of the outrageous waiting times at Immigration over the past year. There seems consistently more Immigration Officers on duty now and the snake system for queuing is supervised properly. It's still not as good as the airport it replaced 5 years ago but it's acceptable.,5.0
312,In a year this has leapt forward no standing in line for passport control on arrival bags delivered quickly and out of the airport within 35 mins of leaving the plane. Still the usual amount of people approach you airside asking if you want a taxi when its a AOT limo service. Overall a good arrival experience. On departure no lines at check-in as all Thai Airways desks looked open passport control I had 2 people in line before me and would have been quick but one of them had lost their departure card. Security lines were longer but nothing huge. My one big gripe with this airport is the shopping there is a great range of shops - but - they are very expensive and one shop can blend into another and you do not know you have crossed into another shop. Good food selection. Walk to some gates can be longer than you think.,9.0
313,BKK airport is basically an overpriced shopping mall with attached gates. The airport is functional and if you are lucky like me immigration can be quite fast (less then 5 min on the last few occasions). However without access to a lounge you can't expect many amenities only bare bones seating areas. Other modern airports in the region such as SIN KUL HG and ICN are way ahead of BKK in terms of customer amenities. Also the distances within the airport such as from your gate to immigration or transfer can be quite long up to 1 km! Overall a 3 star airport best avoided for long transfers but ok for arrivals and departures.,5.0
314,Airport has certainly improved in many areas: Immigration now faster and better organised even staff friendlier. Security centralised and faster better organised. Toilets clean and restaurants fairly priced and ok. Only the huge amount of so called duty-free shops are overpriced.,7.0
315,It is not just the queuing which has improved but the attitude of immigration staff. The Duty free is grossly overpriced restaurants are ok. Toilet facilities are fine.,4.0
316,There are serious problems with huge delays at Immigration both directions. I shuffled and staggered in an arrivals 'mob' for 2 hours. One poor lady just in front of me reached the Immigration counter and was sent away (to the end) because she had not held onto to her Boarding Pass from the flight she just arrived on. By the way I didn't have mine either but was in the next line and not asked. Thailand is called the Land of Smiles but not at the airport!,2.0
317,The worst feature by far is the ridiculous transfer counter system which the airlines and counters split at either ends of the airport meaning 850m walks between them. The airport is dreary grey with unfinished decor pipes and electric's showing on the ceilings in arrivals. It's 'H' shape means walking 900m+ from one end to the other if transferring. If you're upstairs in the eating / departure area it's very hot as the sun comes in through the glass roof. Recently the passport control waiting has been exceptionally long maybe due to work being carried out. The best feature is the fast sky train into the centre of the city at Phaya Thai station (but beware the one that terminates at Makassan station as you have to walk a long way).,3.0
318,"Immigration lines have been out of control for almost a year now. Expect to queue for 2 hours unless you are lucky. Add to this long corridors to reach the gate and few seating areas (everywhere it is crammed with overpriced ""Duty Free"" shops - charging about 30% more than Bangkok High street - and you have a contender for ""worst airport in SEA"".",1.0
319,Flew for a quick getaway to Seoul Korea and then back to BKK. Passport control issue depends on when your flight is. Certain bottle neck rush hours (3-4pm and 8-9pm) are the worst and passengers line up out of the immigration area to the check-in counters. The snake system was finally introduced at arrivals and passed very quickly in 20min. Individual passport processing time is still long though. Duty free isn't really duty free at all food is too expensive and free airport wifi never works. Staff try to smile as much as they can but unable to help other than giving directions anything more complicated and you're on your own.,5.0
320,Was in transit Good parts - picked up from tarmac to First Class lounge with private van then buggy inside the terminal. Lounge spacious adequate food wifi bathing facilities. 1 hour full body massage was luxurious and effective. Bad parts - although flight connected to aerobridge we then had to walk down to the tarmac! Inexcusable for a new airport. Walk to departure gate had several escalator up/down and one stairs down although a ramp is provided.,8.0
321,Arrived last night around 00.20 on a full A380. After all the stinging criticism of the Departures Immigration problems when I departed 2 weeks ago I discovered these have been partly solved with more staff and the introduction of a snake queue system. So having seen that this works why is it that the management of this airport still insist on no snake system at Arrivals? Worst of all last night was the almost complete absence of public taxis at 01.00 am. The queue for these snaked right back into the building. Trying then to get back up to Arrivals level to take one of the notoriously expensive Airport Limousine Taxis I discovered that despite an abundance of escalators and moving walkways you can not get back up! Either they are deliberately switched off or there is a guard on duty who will not permit you to access them! There are also lifts but even these will not permit access to the Arrivals level! What on earth is the purpose of expensive limousine taxis if passengers can not get access to them! I go in and out of this airport a couple of dozen times a year and the continual difficulties passengers are subjected are sadly farcical!,3.0
322,Disappointing and slow check-in process. Long queues and only 3-4 counters open with too many people doing nothing. Immigration and security very smooth on the other hand. Air conditioning didn't seem to work everywhere in the departure hall some areas were very warm. Toilets are not very clean and fairly old. Good shopping no problems in that department.,7.0
323,Visited twice in the last week. First time arrived at 8pm on a Fri night the queue was relatively short and took 15 minutes. Queues departing were short and painless. Came back on an early morning flight and whilst the queue was long it took 20-30 minutes to pass through - very organized and well staffed at immigration. Departing the next day at 5.30am the queue for check-in was horrendous - it took 45 minutes to check-in. I recommend online check-in when arriving for early morning flights. The queue for immigration was well maintained and orderly. However baggage screening area is far too small for the crush of people.,7.0
324,This airport is a disgrace. Although passengers have been complaining of its poor services for years - nothing has been done. Overpriced food passport control takes far too long and causes passengers to miss flights.,2.0
325,I recently spent 1.5 hours in the immigration queue going into Bangkok and my daughter who arrived from a different part of the world spent 2.5 hours. It was most unpleasant with people jostling and trying to jump the lines - there was no order to the procedure.,5.0
326,Departed at 09.15 on 22 March. Absolutely no queue at passport control - a very easy experience! Arrived at 23.00 on 16 March and took 30 minutes through immigration and 45 minutes in the taxi queue which was totally chaotic.,7.0
327,Allow plenty of time to go through passport control. It took us a very uncomfortable (and squashed) hour to get through a queue of only 20 metres - no seating or facilities once you pass the barrier. Queue jumping was most annoying. Probably the worst ever departing experience. Felt very sorry for those with children! Be prepared - take plenty of water and patience and go to the bathroom before you join the queues!,4.0
328,Yet another complaint about immigration queues. It took me 1 hour 22 minutes seemingly shorter than some other reviewers and the reason was that there were 4 booths open for the 200-300 people in front of me. I'd rank such disorganised airports as Sydney Ho Chi Minh and Denpasar as better run than Bangkok.,2.0
329,All I can say is the immigration procedure is farcical. You can expect at least a 1 hour wait at best to clear immigration the adverts say Thailand the land of smiles - noticeably lacking by officers who eventually seemingly begrudgingly stamp your passport allowing you to enter Thailand. Very unwelcoming start to your visit.,1.0
330,Immigration at this airport is a disgrace. It negates all other efforts of Thailand to welcome visitors. Queues are not managed leading to selfish passengers barging in unfairly frayed tempers even risk of injury. Times at passport control can be up to three hours. This airport's immigration arrangements are a joke.,2.0
331,The main complaint is the incredible time you have to spend at immigration. Calculate at least one hour to wait. It might be difficult to find the end of the queue. It tends to spread quite far into the check-in area! Another problem are the long distances to reach the gates especially when in transit. Expect at least a walk of more then one km. Shops are nothing special. Rest areas are non existent except if you have access to any of the lounges.,2.0
332,"Completely agree that the immigration queue for departures is the most horrible I've ever experienced. The problem simply worsened exponentially now as the airport is undergoing ""renovations"" - in short the original VIP channel was shut down and they had to ration out the non VIP channels as the temporary VIP channels making the already chaotic scene even worse. Yesterday I queued for 1.5 hours to get through immigration. It was impossible to find where the queue started and which queue led to which counter there was hardly any staff to maintain the order. Security staff are poor mannered and sometimes can be very offensive. Once passing through security things started to get better: the food selection was good and plenty of cafes and shops. The lack of free internet is disappointing. I think the airport needs to improve on the ""soft items"" like staff manners and enhancement of orders rather than hardware (except for the free wifi).",2.0
333,This airport needs to change its immigration operation drastically. Queuing is similar to a supermarket with lines stretching out from each desk and moving at the pace of the officer. Slow processing officers' lines move slowly fast processing officers lines move less slowly. We arrived in the afternoon and lost 2 hours making our way through lines. Lines for international departures are just as bad. If traveling on business premium immigration/security line access is essential if you do not want to arrive 4 hours in advance of your flight. While the airport is architecturally attractive on the outside the interior is spartan and much time is spent in concrete encased hallways. Food is accessible but overpriced. Overall Bangkok has great potential in its facility but is let down by its operations.,1.0
334,Avoid if you can! After only these relatively few years Bangkok airport looks very old! Don't buy anything. Everything including food and duty free articles are overpriced. Not to mention queuing for passport formalities.,2.0
335,"I live in Thailand and been in and out the airport for 7 years now. The airport link train is ok but not convenient. The check-in process is usually painless if you check-in online however the achilles heal is passport control. Slow disinterested with rather rude hand gestures and barking of requests and manners change depending on your ""ethnic origin"". The system is very slow and inefficient. Security check always fast and efficient. Very long walks free Internet not working forcing you to use the charged service food overpriced. Boarding is ok. Arrivals - long walks and then the dreaded passport control. If you need to use BKK as transit I seriously suggest far more civilized options as SIN KUL HKG.",1.0
336,I pass through this airport every month and every month I dread it. Huge queues for immigration (last time it took 1 hr 45 mins and I almost missed my flight). The toilets are dirty and often broken. The stores and food outlets are overpriced. I travel all round the world and this airport ranks as one of the worst major airports I travel through.,2.0
337,"Been through 3 dozen times in 20+ years due back at the end of the year. Shuddering thinking about the incompetence and long lines for Immigration/Security and the off handed way of Staff. Airport has vastly improved in infrastructure and cleanliness but the overpriced Food/Goods and ""couldn't care less attitude"" of staff make it a horrendous experience arriving and departing.",5.0
338,Flight out of Bangkok on 02 March scheduled at 00.15 hours. What a mess that airport is. I dread flying through there. Check-in was OK but immigration took over an hour and almost missed our flight we got to the gate at 00.25. There is no organisation at immigration every time.,1.0
339,"Mile-long walks to the gate overpriced stores inefficient immigration. I've been through 30+ times and never look forward to it. The airport is new and clean and it's a pity it's not organized better. Immigration is extremely slow and disorganized it takes 40-90min to go through both on arrival and departure. They don't keep the arrival forms stocked and nobody knows where to obtain them. Airport staff are nice but mostly clueless. All smiles willing to help but usually not speaking enough English to help. Food options airside are overpriced. Landside it's a bit better. Security staff are reasonably polite. Getting out is a hassle too unless you know your way. Metered taxis to the city can be found on 1st level but there are pushers trying to sell you a ""limousine taxi"" for 1000+ baht instead of the typical 250-400 meter fare. Airport link train is efficient and useful if you know where to go.",2.0
340,Transiting through this airport is nightmare. I had to walk around two miles from my arriving flight to the transit security area. The transit security screening area makes US Airport Security look efficient and organized. Staff were downright rude. I was flying Thai Airways Business Class and I had to convince 5 supervisors that I was entitled to go through the Priority Line. The regular line was at least 45 minutes. Thai Airways Lounge was a little overcrowded. I have been through this airport a couple of times this year and it seems like everyone is so disorganized. The only thing this airport has going is its modern structure. I much prefer Singapore and Kuala Lumpur Airport.,4.0
341,Arrival: very long waiting and unfriendly staff at immigration. 3 of 4 lifts are blocked not to stop at arrival level! Many exit-doors are locked only the one leading to the airport taxis are open. Arrival area much to small and too many shops. Bathrooms are dirty and broken. Departure: If you arrive on the ground-level you are not aloud to use the many escalators that lead to the upper floors. We had to wait 10 minutes to squeeze in to a tiny elevator. Many officials in that airport have no manners and don't know how to deal with customers.,2.0
342,After a brief period of functionality the Departure Immigration problems are back - and worse than ever. In Departure Immigration at 10pm queues were stretching the entire length of the terminal just to get into the 2 Immigration areas - 45 mins to get into the Immigration Area and a further 50 mins to get your passport stamped - so nearly 2 hours after checking in just to get to the Departures Concourse and make a dash to the gate. No organisation on behalf of the airport other than some barriers and queue jump was totally out of control. The Departure arrangements in BKK are totally broken.,3.0
343,I have travelled to and through BKK a few times now over the past few years and it's a good airport helpful staff and lots of shops - but that's about it. I found food prices over the top and the toilets dirty - not up to the standards you would expect from such a large and popular international airport. Everything is well signed and there are some nice reclining leather seats to sleep in if you have a long stop over although a lot of them are broken.,6.0
344,The only thing going for this airport in my opinion is that it is fairly new and clean. The transit from international to domestic flights are ok if you fly with THAI (separate processing passport control). But my praise pretty much stops here. The walking distances (especially if you are a transit passenger on connecting international flights) are too long. The international departures section is too sprawling and cluttered. The domestic departure area is really nothing to shout about. And the prices charged at food outlets are just too high by Thai standards.,4.0
345,Immigration is true nightmare and has not improved in many years. Facilities and service is not worth the expensive 700baht airport tax. No convenience no kindness very expensive goods foods and drinks. This airport seems only to care about earning money and not the passengers.,3.0
346,I agree with A. Barnett. Arrived exhausted past midnight after long haul from IAD to find long lines at Passport Control. Male official very unwelcoming. I had lost my boarding pass and he gave me a very hard time because supposedly I could not prove what flight I had arrived on. Even after I produced my itinerary showing both the UAL and CO confirmation numbers he would not move me forward. He became quite angry when I told him I could not understand his English which was quite poor. Found a friendly and helpful attendant who came to explain the merger to him and he finally relented. I noticed he had also given two people ahead of me a difficult time and as a result there was a cluster of us just waiting around his counter to see what he would do next. They need more friendly immigration agents if they are to line the passport control process with their tourism promotion. Despite this used BKK again several times during month long stay in the area and other agents' politeness made up for this hopefully one-off nasty agent.,4.0
347,We arrived here from SGN. We went to get our passport cleared where we waited 2 hrs baggage claim was a breeze and we went to the lower floor and the taxi service was very efficient. We came back early in the morning for another flight to DPS and there was quite a bit of walking but everything was smooth. Would use again.,8.0
348,Bad signposting for transit passengers. Otherwise clean free Internet and good duty-free.,7.0
349,Very nice and clean airport. My wife and I flew business class and we were given a premium pass to help us through security and immigration. Very good service and found the airport very user friendly.,10.0
350,Arrived on domestic flight and was bussed to baggage reclaim. Took a while for bags to arrive. Airport train to city is convenient and quick however the timing is only every 30 minutes. Lucky for us we caught it with one minute to spare. Departure was a breeze as we were on TG business class and they have their own check-in area with security check and immigration which means no queuing and we were in the lounge immediately after. It is a functional airport and if you are in Business Class it is a breeze in Economy things look different though.,6.0
351,Flew into Bangkok airport and arrived at 1pm to find massive immigration lines. Took the 4 of us 1.5 hrs to get through immigration. People without visa's did not know they had a separate line. Some lines seemed to be clusters of people pushing each other around. The immigration officers still managed to smile and be polite. On the way out check-in was a breeze. Lines getting out through immigration and customs once again slow disorganized and chaotic. Duty free is not cheap.,7.0
352,While the structure shopping amenities and ornamentation are impressive the operational management and treatment I received was disgraceful. My connecting flight was slightly late the transit security line was a mob scene and I had to move to the side and shove my way to the front where it seemed airport security was selectively letting people without boarding passes through. When I finally arrived at the gate there was a shouting match going on between the gate attendant and a guy who was trying to board the flight without a boarding pass. When I arrived the attendant said I could not get on the flight because my bags were too big even though boarding was still going. I argued back and forth then finally tried to walk away from the mob scene at which point the attendant began shoving me and my bags. Finally I was able to move through the chaos and get on the flight after about 20 minutes of unnecessary wrangling. Airport operatives here do not seem to be above the board in how they deal with customers.,1.0
353,Have found it a positive experience inbound and out - busy no matter what time you are there. Impressive environment facilities are good however the food area on the 4th level is a complete rip off. Avoid it unless you want to pay out of this world prices.,8.0
354,Arrived on THAI business class around 2330 and made for Fast Track Immigration. Only one queue open with a longer line than in the normal Immigration desks! It took over 10 minutes for a 2nd officer to arrive and start reducing the queue. I use the airport a couple of dozen times a year and agree it has started slowly improving the product for passengers. Still very few food and beverage outlets at Departures level though and Duty Free remains amongst the highest in the region. A premium vodka is still one third more expensive than Hong Kong for example. More people movers at Departures Level are urgently required.,5.0
355,Travelled to and from this airport 6 times over the last 9 months and I have nothing to complain about. It is clean systematic and easy airport to get around. Even after my first few visits I easily find my gate. I think it is great that some smoking rooms are present. If you want to spend a limited amount of money or if you want to spend a lot of money there is always places to eat and things to buy.,9.0
356,I fly to BKK twice a year. Suvarnabhumi is a soulless environment. Bare concrete and steel tresses are abundant. It is functional it does what it says on the tin. I preferred Don Muang for it's character not to mention the Royal Thai Golf Course between the two runways there. However never had any major dram's with baggage immigration or transfers between International and Domestic at Suvarnabhumi.,8.0
357,I have flown in and out of this Airport hub many times. I was never treated unkindly or with disrespect by anyone despite the hectic environment. Customs have been less than a 20 minute wait every time. The retail section is pricy when compared to the average price on the street in the surrounding areas of Bangkok but when compared to other airports it is quite good charging no more than for example a London or New York location. Airport is contemporary and modern clean and functional.,8.0
358,Immigration is a nightmare both inbound and outbound of the country. (Long Lines) Immigration agents are a little bit friendlier than in the past but they still do not say anything nor smile. Land of Smiles has not found BKK yet.,4.0
359,Arrived 6pm to the usual immigration chaos long lines and only half the booths open. Usual slowness from officials. 1hr 10min later picked up my bag. On exiting and passing all the touts looking for business I used the new airport-city train link which was a pleasant inexpensive experience. On return the check-in was smooth but then the same at emigration - long lines backing into the check-in area. An hour later I was through. Duty free is expensive and the food outlets charge crazy prices - 60baht for a bottle of water. Fortunately I had a lounge pass. All over the airport they advertise the slogan 'Airport of Smiles'. Nothing has improved at Bangkok despite all the press releases and all the promises.,1.0
360,The difference in crowding between afternoon and late evening is dramatic. The terminal is so much quieter in the afternoon - 5 mins to check-in Air Asia 5 mins in Immigration and 2 mins in Security - try that at 9pm. Other than that the seating areas at the beginning of the Piers are a welcome addition.,3.0
361,For a relatively new airport this one is an architectural disgrace. Designed with no thought to passenger flow or convenience. It's basically a kilometre long thin tube lined with shops Immigration and Emigration cramped with most desks unoccupied leading to queues that back up on themselves. Airline lounges are impossible to find due to a complete lack of signage. Passengers are expected to walk several hundred metres because of the lack of travelators.,2.0
362,I try to limit my journeys through BKK as much as I can. On this latest occasion I decided to sit it out in the terminal. In wandering around I did notice a ray of hope for future outbound travellers - it looks as if they are expanding one of the outbound immigration areas. I observed the late night rush to Europe and Australia which was as bad as ever snaking back almost to the check-in desks. Inbound immigration was quicker than in the past but as others have commented no 'emotion' from the IOs.,2.0
363,We found arrivals/departures extremely seamless and stress free. Quick to get through immigration - security with no real delays. Lots of duty free and good food options. We had to spend 6 hrs waiting for next connection for flight home and didn't find the wait as bad as we thought it would be. Taxi area can be chaos but that's normal. Overall quite an impressive airport.,4.0
364,A huge terminal building. Clean modern well maintained facilities however the biggest problem is that they are not strategically located. If you are a Star Alliance Gold member travelling Economy class on a TG international flight the check-in counters are located at one end of the terminal which are far from TG international Economy counters with not enough signs to indicate. The departure immigration and security queues are within an acceptable length. In addition there are lots of shops in the concourse. Thai's lounge is also nice however you have to walk a few hundred meters to enter it and to get to flights you have to go downstairs and walk back another few hundred meters to the gate. As a result we need to leave the lounge more than 45 mins before departure to be safe. It is a good airport but you cannot enjoy the facilities if you only stay there for less than 2 hrs.,4.0
365,I used this airport a lot during my trip. International arrival. Walking distance from plane to passport control was ok the line for passport control was average but each desk has its own line. About 90% of desks were being used. In one case people had not filled out landing cards and were allowed to fill them in at the desk holding up that line. Baggage had started arriving by the time I had cleared passport control. Domestic (BKK-CNX one way) (BKK- USM-BKK) check in desks close to domestic security control no queues for my airline short line for security longer walk than expected to gates but good selection of shops and food outlets. International departure. Arrived early for my flight so was there for opening of check-in so it was very quick. However it took me over 1 hr to clear passport and security again 1 desk 1 line slowing process down. If they can sort this problem out then all would be well. Good selection of shops and food outlets but none at gate areas.,3.0
366,Used this airport for transit only so dont have much to say on immigration and check in. For a transit passenger sailing through arrival to transit is quite easy signs are clear enough to take you to your next flight and if you've hours to kill this is not a bad place to be. Reclining seats are a good place to kill your jet lag as you wait for your next flight. Also the Thai massage experience is a must which is not expensive. Free wifi and food court almost everywhere allows you to taste thai food. The airport is clean and staff are helpful.,4.0
367,Arrived from Singapore at 8am. It took me 10 mins to pass immigration and luggage was out at the belt within 15 mins after landing. The trolleys were free. Vat refund at the airport was prompt and efficient. One has to verify the purchases before check in and obtain the customs chop and signature before claiming the Vat refund in the duty free area. I have managed to check in the items before proceeding to the VAT refund in the duty free area. Queue was short and VAT refund was processed within 10 mins. There was a lot of passengers shopping in the duty free area. Was told that the boutiques in the duty free are open for 24 hrs unlike Spore Changi where they are open till midnight. Managed to get some good buys at the duty free as my flight was delayed for 4 hrs. Prices and selection of food quite reasonable. 2 FOC internet PC were available in each dep gates. However BKK airport can be improved by having more indoor plants as it appears to be rather depressing and cold in the arrival and departing gates. Overall a pleasant airport.,4.0
368,"Flew with Qatar from Bangkok-Hanoi. Bangkok airport is a hit or miss depending on flight times. Passport control was not zigzagging from the area out to the check in counters. Officers did their job without a hint of emotion. Duty free was ignored all the way through. A rather good experience but if you need to fly from/to Europe then you are most probably stuck in the airport's rush hour and it seriously deteriorates the travel experience. Regarding the free internet wifi the signal is full but no connection. Thus assuming its the usual ""we have wifi as most international airports"" but the network is not functional trying to force you to get the paid gateways. a shame really.",4.0
369,"Considering it is a new (relatively) 'flagship' airport it is poor. Design is a mess huge areas of glass in the tropics - stupid mistake which means the window areas are now having blinds retro fitted. Convenient seating sometimes impossible. Wi-Fi is a complete & utter joke you have to go to an info desk these seem to be situated at the very extremes of the terminal so this in itself involves a long walk and sign a register with personal details (which are not checked so you can put completely false info - so why bother?) and then you get a long code to input to receive 15 mins of Wi-Fi. The whole system seems like a half baked attempt but misses the point that when you sign the register the info is not checked I wrote all my details falsely! Worst of all are the ridiculous immigration queues in today's world of modern passports with ""swipe"" magnetic strips why does it take so long to process an individual through immigration?",3.0
370,Spacious split level airport with plenty of restaurants and seating facilities. Immigration can be a headache if you arrive around midday and in spite of 12 available aisles it can take around 30 mins to clear during peak periods. Departure is even worse and you'd be well advised to allow at least 1hr to clear immigration during peak periods in order to avoid missing your flight. Toilets are clean but there often seems to be a lack of paper hand towels. Also they don't seem to enforce the no smoking ban in the toilets and one is often greeted by the pungent smell of stale tobacco smoke. Navigating between floors can be a headache since the lift often skips a floor for no apparent reason and you end up at a different level than the intended one. Security staff subsequently refuse to allow you to use a walkway to get to the floor you intended to go to. So you're forced to return to your starting point and look for an escalator to go to the floor you actually want to reach. Only two banks available (Siam and TMB) which offer very poor exchange rates. On the plus side Thai SIM cards are available at either the AIS (1-2-Call) or DTAC (Happy) service desks on level 2. Staff will set up your mobile for you and extend the validity period if you wish to keep the same number for a subsequent visit. Provided you use the AOT taxi booths on the ground floor and pay the 50 Baht service charge you'll have no problem with the touts who hang around the upper levels looking for gullible travellers who don't know the ropes. Taxis are metered and unlike Phuket are cheap. There is also a non- stop rail link between the airport and the city centre with a flat rate fee of 150 Baht.,5.0
371,An airport of mixed experiences. Still relatively new as far as infrastructure goes and plenty of facilities to keep one distracted during a long wait. The building itself is rather monolithic and therefore lacks the bright and airy feel of terminals like HKG and the arrivals concourse can seem rather stark. My only two gripes with this airport are: air- conditioning. It never seems to be working properly and queuing at immigration outwards and inwards. Individual queues in front of each counter is a hopeless set-up. It is frustratingly slow to the point of desperation. I wonder why they haven't set up a single queue and have the first available counter call the next person in line. Also the officers at the counters processing Thai passports only when they have cleared their queues are happy to just sit and let the foreign passport queues swell. These points aside Suvarnabhumi is a good world-class airport.,4.0
372,Magnificent airport. Was flying on Swiss Business Class so I got to use the Fast track lane through customs and security. The Thai business class lounge was great and was right next to the gate. As opposed to US airline lounges the Thai lounge had a large buffet with an extensive selection of food. Can't wait to go to this airport again.,5.0
373,After reading all the comments I was very surprised to rush through customs in the afternoon within 15 mins only. Baggage received within 30 mins after landing. At departure we enjoyed a good check-in for our Swiss flight to ZRH had to queue a bit at customs roughly 10 mins and no waiting time at security. Duty Free much too expensive so no interest to use them. Overall pretty clean but showing some its age now. Departure gates could be a bit more customer friendly.,4.0
374,Although the prices in the shops are totally ludicrous and most far higher than at down town Bangkok the one good thing is that if you are flying business or first class at least with Thai you go through immigration in special express lanes that are very fast and necessary after a walk of several kilometres from the arrival gate.,4.0
375,I live in Thailand and use this airport quite a lot as a leisure traveller. I try to choose early morning arrivals or departures which seems to eliminate the queuing problems - I wouldn't consider a flight arriving/departing in the late morning or afternoon. Immigration officials are not very talkative even with Thai people so it might be a little unfair to comment on their seeming unfriendliness it's the way they are with everyone and is quite common with Thai officials everywhere not just at the airport. Shops are outrageously expensive compared to Thai street prices but we counter that by buying snacks & water outside the airport. Seating can also be a problem at times. Also be aware that scams and rip-offs are not uncommon at the duty-free shops and have been known to get people in trouble - items you haven't bought being put in a bag with legitimate purchases without your knowledge or as a gift unintentionally wandering outside the limits of the shop with an item you haven't yet paid for maybe to show others; both of these have been known to land travellers with the threat of prosecution and expensive fines (ie. bribes) to avoid jail. Thailand is a terribly inefficient non-customer friendly place and this airport epitomises that on the whole.,3.0
376,The cost of refreshments is an absolute rip off! Examples: a small bottle of Heineken beer is 180 Baht compared to 40 Baht in outside mini mart shops. A small bottle of water is 60 Baht compared to approx 7 Baht outside. Similarly the (duty free?) airport shops are pretentious and extremely expensive compared to shops outside. Thailand is well known and appreciated for its value for money therefore it is a great shame and leaves a sour taste that the airport authority's parting shot is to cynically extract the last few baht from their visiting tourists in this way.,3.0
377,Arrived there for the first time at approx 10pm huge queue for immigration at least 90 mins got told by someone in the queue in front of me that they had just closed 2 booths and moved everybody over to the other ones the immigration officer was very unfriendly and said only the very minimum to me. By the time I got through immigration found my bags and found my shuttle trip it was about 12.30.,3.0
378,The real problems begin when you arrive at immigration. Very crowded and big lines. Took me 90 minutes to pass - really not acceptable. This makes the start of a holiday in Thailand less good and very tireful after so many hours of travelling. Few days later domestic departure with no immigration busy no big queues for security checks. For international departing I would recommend to stick to 3 hours before at the airport as immigration take 60 minutes. Overall enough shops at the airport people friendly and airport clean.,3.0
379,I used to live in Bangkok so frequently travelled in and out of the old airport Don Mueng. I recently flew into Suvarnabhumi for the first time and it completely lacks any insight into the flow of people around the place. It's clumsy unintuitive and the immigration queues are obscene - at least an hour each way and lots of pushing and shoving from unorganised queues and frustrated and irritable passengers.,1.0
380,Like others have said immigration lines here are terrible. I've departed and entered via this airport more than a dozen times over the last 2 years and it's gotten marginally better but still bad. If you're travelling biz/1st it's no problem because you get the special Fast Trac program that has 4 dedicated passport control to serve a handful of passengers. But if you don't have the fast track it's a nightmare. The immigration officers are not friendly.,2.0
381,Arrived at about 9pm at night. Passport control was quick but English was poor. Airport very modern and large but easy to get around. Spacious and comfortable for a tourist.,4.0
382,Things seem to have gone downhill with Suvarnabhumi a little since my last trip here but only with passing through immigration. Not sure maybe the number of arrivals has picked up? Waited about 20 minutes inbound but outbound back to Australia waited over an hour - I really cannot see the point of having such a large airport and only having 2-3 gates open - perhaps they are low on staff. Aside from that some nice comfortable areas to rest and eat in the airport prior to departure although the internet IS a little slow. Airport is an amazing design as well - lots to look at. Hope that customs/immigration can pick up their game a little before my next trip.,4.0
383,Arriving at almost 11 pm there were shorter queues to immigration/passport control. I noticed that the toilets are more well-maintained. Taxi queue is also efficient. However on departure horrors! First the Customs Office was not manned at all (I arrived at 10am) so I was not able to have my VAT Refund validated. I couldn't wait any further after seeing the extensively long queues to passport control and subsequently to security check. I must have queued for almost an hour. Naturally since my refund forms were not validated I was not able to get my refund back (was told I have 60 days) to claim my refund (if and when I return to Bangkok during this time frame). After reading a lot of reviews re duty free prices I decided to skip shopping. Most restaurants are filled with customers so I was not able to grab a snack and decided to wait for the inflight meal served at almost 2:30pm. Overall Suvarnabhumi Airport is comparably better with other airports in Asia (except Changi HKIA and KLIA in that order). As I am a frequent visitor to Bangkok small improvements in this airport are appreciated and hope that they remain consistent. And free wi-fi should be extended to everyone who needs it without any time usage limitations.,4.0
384,Having used this airport several times this year already I am constantly dismayed by the ever lengthening lines at immigration both going into and out of the country. The time between landing and getting out of immigration can be extremely long if you are unfortunate enough to have the double whammy of a long taxi once the plane has landed and understaffed immigration desks. Unfortunately this is not uncommon.,3.0
385,I arrived 2nd April to huge queues again (came out in July). It took me 90 minutes to get through immigration. I have travelled all over the world and I dread arriving here. My elderly parents want to come here and I have told them that with the heat and queues that they would faint. It is a horrible experience and I was alone I bet it's worse for families. Keep away if possible.,1.0
386,A lot of negative comments (quite rightly) about Immigration at BKK. On the plus side last time I travelled earlier in the evening (1800hrs) things were much improved in Departure Immigration (10-15mins) all desks were operational and there was no segregation between Thai and Foreign Passports. Security fine and there are now some decent seating areas close to the Gates with soft seating TV's plants etc. On Arrivals it's very much hit and miss - I've rarely taken longer than 15mins to get through Immigration baggage is still slow (30 mins from aircraft parked to bags on the belt) but there are fewer taxi touts cluttering up Arrivals. They've also done away with this ridiculous system where Landside some of the travelators were restricted to Airport Pass users (ie to get between floors you had to use the Elevators). BKK airport management have finally come to realise that the airport is there to serve the needs of the customers - not preferences of the employees. I have to agree with the earlier comment - Don Mueang was a better airport than Suvarnabhumi for the passenger.,3.0
387,The old Don Muang airport leaves this new one for dead. Immigration lines are so slow now over an hour - used to clear customs in 10-15 min at Don Muang. Suvarnabhumi feels like a warehouse.,2.0
388,I have read the reviews which are mainly accurate. Used the airport on several occasions in Jnauary/Feb/March. Immigration is sometimes extremely slow due almost entirely to the increase in passenger numbers. I was pleased to note there is now a priority queue for oldies (like me) and parents with young children. This saved me a long wait. One of the problems is that when new flights come in queues can get very long in seconds.,3.0
389,Immigration is a nightmare. We queued for 1 hr to enter and 1.30 hr to leave. Only half the desks were manned. You would think they would do better to alleviate the queues.,1.0
390,Outbound immigration just doesn't get any better and there seems no will on the part of the Thai authorities to get a grip with the problem. I have tried morning noon and night and its still the same regardless of the time of day. Some airlines are sending out search parties to find their pax. Other airlines are advising their pax to turn up four hours before flight because of the long lines. If you are in another major city in Thailand make sure your carriers co-operate and clear outbound immigration before you get to Bangkok. Immigration in Chaing Mai means no lines no waiting and through in less than 2 minutes. And the departure lounge is less busy as it is apart from the domestic departure area.,1.0
391,The service (or lack of it) is getting worse by the day. Long queues sometimes one and a half hours are not uncommon. I wish I could enter Thailand at another airport. When I left Thailand recently the queue at immigration was so long we had to queue outside the immigration hall. Then we found that only half the booths were being used. Then there are still so many touts at the airport trying to entice weary arrivals.,2.0
392,Extremely long queues at Immigration (90 mins average) unfriendly staff expensive tax-free monopoly taxi touts at arrivals the list is endless. Avoid unless obliged to come to Thailand.,1.0
393,Our experience was nothing but positive. We used it 4 times 2 international 2 domestic flights. It is modern clean cool and spacious. Signposted reasonably well. We were fast tracked through immigration (QR Business) and took no longer than 5 minutes - guess this improved things a lot for us. We also used the Bangkok Air lounge and Thai Silk lounge - both were ok. Loads of places to change currency. Lovely gardens to look out onto.,5.0
394,The service cleanliness shops all satisfactory. The downers are long queue in Immigration center (Departure or Arrival) distance between the Immigration to Waiting room are too far and there's no announcement of your flights boarding outside the waiting room.,4.0
395,"I notice the Immigration and passport staff are very poor are very rude to Indian sub- continent passenger. I noted all over the airport there were banners written with ""Airport of smiles"" - I didn't see that!",2.0
396,They really need to improve the airport immigration (very slow and the lines move at different speed). Going through security can also take a long time. There is also a lack of facilities and entertainment for travelers to pass time.,3.0
397,The lousiest Airport I know. Immigration is a nightmare - last week the outgoing line at immigration was back around 300 meters. Why no line for residents?,1.0
398,Immigration queues are a nightmare. Customs staff not friendly. Baggage doesn't arrive that fast. Taxi touts after customs. Duty free monopolized. staff English is not very good. Several toilet areas need repairs. Cleaning staff having their lunch on the floor behind the duty free shops also some make-shift offices there as well as in the immigration area. During daytime can be hot in the terminal additional aircon installed in Immigration area doesn't look very professional. Food expensive. No seating provided in the waiting area of the train to the city. No free WIFI in the terminal. A lot of improvised 'signboards' (A4-paper) can be found all looks very shabby. You have to walk a lot to get from immigration to the gate (or the other way around).,2.0
399,I don't mind the inadequate toilets here but immigration queues are terrible especially in the morning. Being forced to travel every Monday I have been forced to resort to traveling on TG Business Class to avoid the queues but obviously this is not an option for most people. It would be great if the immigration problems on departure could be rectified but I guess this is not going to happen any time soon.,4.0
400,Really not sure what's going on but Departure Immigration in the late evening in BKK is getting ridiculous. Took 35 mins just to get into the Immigration Area and a further 40 mins to get to the Desk and 2 mins to get a stamp. Thankfully Security was but 5 minutes but for some reason Immigration in BKK is broken. Down at the gates flights were being held up and bags offloaded because late checking-in passengers simply weren't getting to the gate in time to make the scheduled departure time. I think there are about 20 desks in each of the 2 departure Immigration Areas... couple that with 20? International piers each with say 10-12 Check-In Desks each (that's 200+ Desks) and all of those passengers have to get their passports stamped. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to work out that Immigration provision is totally inadequate.,3.0
401,Had to queue at passport control for almost 2 hours when leaving last Saturday. No organization of the queue whatsoever. This is the worst airport I know and I dread going back here.,1.0
402,I passed through here at Christmas. On arrival immigration queue was OK took around 20 mins but the problem on departure was the security screening which took ages. It was quite disorganised. Generally the staff are rather unsmiling especially at immigration. The shops are very expensive.,2.0
403,Midnight flight to London immigration queues out of the designated area snaking back all the way past check-in desk to the front doors! About 90 minutes to get through. Not a single member of airport staff controling the increasingly frustrated crowd or keeping people in order (ie. Chinese/Japanese from pushing in). The other side at security scanning 6 people guiding people to an x-ray machine! Ridiculous. This morning 8am flight to Jakarta again over-flowing outside the glass-walled area but queuing time down to half an hour max. I wouldn't mind so much if I was going home but I live here and have to put up with this rubbish once a month.,2.0
404,Midnight flight to London immigration queues out of the designated area snaking back all the way past check-in desk to the front doors! About 90 minutes to get through.

I wouldn't mind so much if I was going home but I live here and have to put up with this rubbish once a month.,2.0
405,Allow an extra hour to get through immigration! Had to queue for 1.5 hours to exit customs/immigration as a tourist with the queues right through this so called new airport. Terrible way to treat visitors to ones country who are spending their hard earned cash. Also prevents people getting into the duty free area with time to make use of the airport facilities. Terrible system and extremely frustrating. Not sure why this is happening. Never had such a bad experience leaving a country after an amazing holiday. Terrible shame to leave a country being treated like cattle.,1.0
406,Check in no problem went to passport control and the line of passengers snaked well out into check in areas. I was very lucky to get to gate on time a lot of anger expressed and airline reps trying to find passengers absolute madness - especially when most of passport control desks were closed.,1.0
407,Bangkok airport certainly is and after a long time of criticism trying to work out some problems that it is facing but for me it is ignoring the most important and the one that causes most irritation. I am talking about immigration. Passport control is always in chaos. There are 2 main rush hours in the airport still struggles with very slow passport control officers and less than 50% of the pass-checks open. 55minutes on departure and 45min at arrival is just unacceptable. The marketing of Suvarnabhumi is visible in the Thai media as they are achieving faster service and with a smile. I reckon most of the passport control officers flanked the lessons. All I see at the pass desk is stickers and advertising of who supplied the camera who supplied the air freshener etc. So if I can give passport control any grade lower than zero I would. Otherwise security was better and faster the so-called duty free has lost my attention for the last 6 years so I just go through still nothing of interest close to the gates and the place there looks like a barren desert waiting at gates much better with padded seats giving the place a better look always prepare for long walks at arrival to the passport controls.,3.0
408,I have often transited through this airport but never actually left the airport until this visit. For a modern airport it is a shambles - it is hard to work out where you are going in particular from the domestic to the international terminals. Additionally I do not know why an airport with so many air bridges you still have to be bussed to your plane - surely they would have thought of this when building the place. Immigration looked like a nightmare but lucky we had fast tracks and did not have to put up with the huge lines for non- Thai citizens. Overall a fabulous looking building but not user friendly.,2.0
409,The airport is impressive  but I would rather spend less than 35 minutes queuing at immigration and have less luxury shops. The airport express link to the city is excellent  I miss old Don Muang's more traditional aspect !,3.0
410,Generally not bad but only 5 out of 16 passport control desks for foreign passport holders were opened when I went through resulting in a wait time of just over a half hour.,4.0
411,Something needs to be done at the Arrival Hall. Very chaotic and packed. The area is still very confusing and closed-off as usual. Touts are not in the arrival hall but are instead in the baggage claim area! I was asked whether or not I will get a taxi there two times! Departure: maze-like queuing system is much needed to prevent people from jumping back and forth between lines. Signage - the new black signs are much clearer. Decoration - adding more stuff in doesn't make the airport more appealing! The authority seriously needs someone with sense of style to come and decorate the airport.,3.0
412,I transit BKK twice a month on average and on my latest outbound journey which was mid- afternoon I was horrified to see that the lines at immigration were as long as at other times of the day. The signs promoting the 20 minute wait system have been taken down. This was despite making some of the Thai passport lanes for Thai/foreign passport holders. Usual agitated people trying to queue jump with those in front standing firm and rightly so. Thai immigration needs to hire more staff. This has been a thorny issue for years and it was never that bad at Don Muang. The return journey was the best yet thanks to the plane parking near the immigration area on the D concourse and got lucky as a new officer came on duty and as everyone rushed to his desk it left my line virtually void of people.,2.0
413,Been though BKK most months this year. Passenger numbers are on the rise again and pressuring the system. Choke points now are in Immigration with lengthy queues at most times of the day. I wouldn't arrive at the airport an hour before Departure Time - you may not make it. (1/2 hour minimum getting through Immigration). They've done a reasonable job of slicking up the Security areas after Immigration and that seems to be working well. Arrivals is fine with a lower taxi tout concentration than last year. Haven't tried the Rail Link yet. Some way to go before BKK hits the standards of HKG SIN or ICN but it's getting better.,4.0
414,Walking to gates especially from connecting flights or reboarding a flight can be annoying but its otherwise a good airport. Passport staff quite friendly. When arriving at night it can appear a bit unprofessional many staff everywhere and many just sitting around reading filing their nails etc. Can be hard to move freely about the airport. If you venture downstairs to where the taxis are and leave your bags with your family in the arrivals area it can be hard to get back upstairs as security make it hard for you to go back upstairs and don't understand english for you to explain. Two security checks for Australian flights and staff seem good at their job. Food expensive and also souvenirs and everything else especially duty free more expensive than in a western airport - shops were mostly empty. Lots of restaurants and cafes in the departures area lots of places to sit. Free 15 minutes of internet with wifi after signing at information desk.,4.0
415,In general the airport is a pleasant experience but the walking distances can be astonishingly long. Especially for connections there can be a 15-20 minute hike involved if the gates are far apart. It is a pleasant environment and the signage is better than in many airports--a good thing as you would not want to retrace your steps.,4.0
416,I have used Suvarnabhumi since it opened. It has improved greatly particularly the last 6 months. New trolleys. Color signage instead of only white. Refitted seats. More toilets. Airport Rail Link. The single security check after immigration was implemented to comply with new US regulations stating all airports with US bound flights originating in them must have single security check system rather than the BKK previous security check system which was divided the screenings into about 6 different areas just before each wings section (the original Thai system was better as it split up the crowd across the airport instead of into the small area near immigration as now required by US law). So people shouldn't blame the Thai people for the crowds at the security check area. People who complain about the overpriced food should list those airports with cheaper food and the list would be very short indeed. Suvarnabhummi is getting better all the time and hopefully when Terminal 2 is built they will improve on certain design faults.,4.0
417,How is it possible for a new airport to have so many non-airbridge parking bays? I reckon BKK has at least 40. Arriving back from PVG on a new TG A340-600 aircraft around 21:30 on Sunday evening I counted at least 15 unoccupied airbridge gates on the east side of the airport (and more on what little I could see of the west side). Yet we had to park way out on the tarmac. No dedicated first and business class buses. We were trundled half way around the airport packed into smoky smelly buses before then having to wait whilst 4 other buses unloaded their passengers at a single entry door. With this sort of experience Suvarnabhumi will never be more than a second class airport.,3.0
418,At arrival long queues at immigration. Still nothing improved. At departure good shops nice to walk around clean toilets. Nice airport.,4.0
419,Suvarnabhumi has improved recently. They are opening more booths at passport control and they even put cushions on the metal seats in the waiting area. Also the restrooms are reasonably clean. Food and drinks are ridiculously expensive for Thailand standards.,4.0
420,The layout is woeful. I must have walked for about two kilometers past a ludicrous amount of duty free shops to get from one poorly signed terminal to another. Only reached my gate with 10 minutes to spare (from a 90 minute layover). They desperately need a monorail type system to move passengers from terminal to terminal quickly although the cynic in me thinks that there's a reason why they are forced to walk past all the duty free shops with their overpriced goods. Will be avoiding in future if at all possible which is a shame since I quite enjoyed my Thai Airlines flight from Melbourne.,1.0
421,Sydney-Bangkok-Helsinki return. Only real criticism was the signage was a little confusing but for a large airport it works.,4.0
422,Transited through this airport twice on the weekend. Generally very good but the lighting on the lower floors is very murky. The airport monitors were also playing up. The airport appears to be enormous but both my departures on Thai involved being bussed to the plane.,4.0
423,A nice airport generally but probably the most inefficient I have been to. Tthe slowest and most ill mannered immigration staff. Poor regulation of shops etc landside who seem to prey on new unsuspecting tourists ripping them off at will.,2.0
424,Beware if you're a transit passenger from domestic to international flights. The information provided and signs to follow are ludicrous. I have never yet twigged despite multiple attempts in the past 3 years. Some airlines require you to check in again at a transfer desk if you can find it. If Emirates business passenger you can get your boarding card from their lounge but impossible to find airline lounges. On arrival from abroad and business passenger walk past the customs and immigration signs immediately afterwards there are the CIP gates which you should use saving lots of queues and time. If making a domestic flight be wary of the people who ask where you are going prior to security. They are merely travel agents looking for some trade although they look very official and have nothing to do with the airport or security. Their prices are more expensive than those you could get at your destination.,4.0
425,My impression of BKK was positive compared to 1 year ago. We had only short queues on both arrival and departure including customs and security checks. Restrooms were clean - however we might just have been lucky this time.,4.0
