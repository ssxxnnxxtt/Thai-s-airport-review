0,"Horrible experience. Meet and greet parking - a man points to the space, then you attempt to self check in… Not enough space in the terminal for the numbers of people going through. My husband lost his Fitbit at security. Queues outside all of the bars and restaurants. Lots of people sitting on the floor. Felt so sorry for the unhappy staff, imagine having to go to this miserable place every day. A few hours is enough. Felt relieved to read the reviews that this is not the new normal",1
1,"Extremely rude staff at baggage check. Unhelpful. Struggled with closing a plastic bag which they insisted that I had to zip up. Was also told that I should try harder or get out of the way. Eventually after refusing to help because it wasn't his job to assist, the member of staff did help but subsequently  made the comment that it wasn't so difficult after all if you tried hard enough.Never experienced such rude behaviour at an airport. Supervisor was in earshot and dealt with other customers in an equally disrespectful way. Wasn't busy as it was just after 5 am so staff were not stressed.",1
2,"Utterly, totally clueless at security. Putting trays through in a different order to passengers queuing to go through the body scan and collect their luggage doesn’t work. Trays get pulled for inspection and then those people are still the wrong side of the metal detector. No more bags can then come through and no one is there to claim their bag and keep the process moving. Stood waiting for 15 minutes for my bags to come through whilst they tried to unpick the problem. All the gear, no idea is probably a good summary. Just sort your airport out as it is without doubt one of the most soul destroying places in this planet.",1
3,"Have collected family from Manchester airport 3 times this year and every time it took over 1 hour from the plane landing to them collecting their luggage.To make matters worse they charge you for parking in that time between £10-£20 and this time there was a further 30 minute queue to get out of the T2 west carpark, so it charged an extra £6 at the barrier for making me queue for 30 minutes just to leave a car park.Going to book an airport further away for my next holiday, not worth the hassle.",1
4,"What a truely, grotty depressing place. Ripped seats everywhere, dark depressing interior.A most unpleasant experience, whether arriving or departing & tbh, a National embarrassment.All the more surprising as 'extensive' renovations have been a constant feature for years.It can't be due to a lack of funds.You stand still & you have to pay a fee!!",1
5,"I went to pickup from T3 today. Trying to get to a pickup area is a nightmare, the signs don't make any sense, direct you into areas you don't want to be, and then you can't get out of. The fact that they charge for dropoff and pickup  is bad enough, but at least make it easy!Obviously they have never asked anyone who isn't familiar with the airport to try and navigate the roundabouts and get to the pickup area. These are things that could be so easily fixed, but Manchester Airport has become a bit of a joke.",1
6,"Just returned home from a trip to Europe. Flew in and out of many airports Manchester stood out as the worst one by miles!! The experience was terrible, huge queues to get through security. Many people missing flights and most flights delayed. I think it’s the worst airport I have ever been to. Will ensure I never return",1
7,"The charges for being dropped off and collected are just shocking.  Absolute rip-off, and especially egregious given that the drop-off experience is very poor.  Getting a taxi is a woefully painful experience, where you have to navigate short stay car parks to get a cab!  And Terminal 2, who designed it with so few travelators, and 8 flights of stairs to get down to the plane.  Worst airport I know in Europe.",1
8,Manchester airport is a shambles. Security was long and painful. Staff had no idea what they were doing. Very slow and happy to have long conversations with colleagues. When asked to speed up as we were going to miss our flight we were met with sarcasm and rudeness. After that our flight was delayed for eight hours. We have no idea why as we were not spoken to properly it again met with rudeness and aggression when able to speak to someone. Guys at San Carlos were excellent and so was the food.,1
9,"This airport is possibly the worst in the world. Absolutely miserable and extremely rude and unhelpful staff, terrible, lazy customer service. Awful terminal design, chaotic systems and no regard for customer experience. would rather drive to the other side of the country than use this airport again",1
10,"Manchester airport is possibly the worst airport in the UK. It is such a rip off as it is poorly marked for parking and when you take a wrong turn, you have to pay at least £6 to get out. Disgusting and immoral.",1
11,"Paid £5 to drop off my wife and her three sisters, three hours prior to departure. They are still in security with a departure of 6.55 as I write this at 6.40. I personally wouldn't use this joke of an airport, but that was the package they bought. Let's hope they actually get there.....",1
12,"Total incompetence, from start to finish, unfortunately behaving like a monopoly. Car park booking system is down, customers keep trying, but they don't put a notice on the website. Customers' cards then get blocked because of failed attempts. THESE GUYS DO NOT CARE LESS.............",1
13,Worst airport in the world.  I travel extensively for work and avoid Manchester airport if possible.  Security have their own rules that are not applicable at any other airport.  I can only assume that no one who works at the airport has travelled through other airports.   Once great airport ruined by incompetent management and staff.  Shambles.,1
14,"Flew into T2 in the early hours on a delayed flight from Antalya!Despite there being 3 flights arriving in the same hour, it took nearly 2 hours for our luggage to reach the carousel.We were told to move carousels twice only to be the re-directed to the original one, but that’s incidental and pretty much par for the course here.When I unpacked my luggage on my return home it was absolutely wringing wet through, so clearly had been left uncovered in the Manchester rain.This really is the last time I will use this airport the place has become a complete shambles!!!",1
15,Not great - problem getting into pre-booked car park - security was a nightmare - not enough lanes open for the amount of people - the staff that were on tried their best(not their fault) - but not enough of them,2
16,We paid to use the 1903 lounge at terminal 2 first thing in the morning. What a waste of money. The breakfast items were cold and must have been sitting at the buffet for quite a long time. Never again. Paid for fast track and had to queue with everybody else to get through the scanners. Again a waste of money as it took over 30 mins.,1
17,"Still no improvement with the level of customer service at security. Absolutely diabolical - thought I'd upgrade to business - check Inn great, lounge ok, despite a 15 minute queue to get in -....rude and incompetent security staff let the place down yet again.",1
18,"Returning from Alicante via Jet2 on Thursday 13/10/2022 at 14:17.Long walk from aircraft to border gates..no moving walkways working. Filthy floors. Was ushered in assistance queue, nothing was moving. Moved over to self-scanning queue, nothing moving.Taken out of that queue and put into 'faster lane'.Nothing moving. Border forces ride, shouty and idle.Huge lines of travellers, not enough gates manned.Eventually got out of terminal, asked for a cab...told 25 minute wait!!!25 minutes for a cab at an international airport??Just getting worse and worse.",1
19,"Over the years I've travelled through many airports in many parts of the world.The one I have used most for the past few years has been Manchester as it's now mainly just holidays.It has never stood out in any way.It's just been a relatively efficient means of putting people and baggage on and off planes. It is now begining to stand out as an airport in decline. Dirty, understaffed, illmaintained and consequently producing neither a smooth or pleasant experience. Although they would claim otherwise I believe the failings can almost all be attributed to poor management. Even the surley attitude of some staff can be laid at their door. While we are somewhat of a captive clientel I will deffinately consider alternative airports until things improve.",3
20,"Absolute shambles! Still sat on the plane after half an hour waiting for the walkway. Apparently, there is rubbish in there that needs moving. The place is unfit for purpose!",1
21,"Worst airport i've ever been too,Expect someone who is disabled who cant drive and to have a blue badge to drive them self to terminal 2 and abandon their non existant car outside the terminal to get free dropoff and also have non existant marshalls which wern't there also a person who was supposed to meet the disabled person wasn't there",1
22,Travelled from Manchester Airport yesterday. APPALLING! Wake up and smell the coffee everybody.DON’T USE MANCHESTER AIRPORT!!!!WORST EXPERIENCE OF TRAVELLING IN THE LAST 38 YEARS!AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!,1
23,This is an appalling experience. Q's are outrageous for everything. Staff have stopped caring and its becoming obvious that management has left the building. However the debacle of borderforce and the unacceptable delays indicate a serious lack of professionalism and are not reflected by my experiences at other UK and European airports. Given the fact this government agency fully financed by tax payers it's an poor reflection on the UK government. It very disappointing that Greater Manchester authority and the mayor are not making the government account for the failings. The sick man of European airports and quite frankly a shame on Manchester.,1
24,"Arguably the worst airport in the UK.Where are the managers of this debacle , where do they hide, why do they fail to take any responsibility to get feedback from travellers. You can only guess. That underground bunker must be pretty cosy away from the ridiculous ques and failings for service in all departments .",1
25,"Back in February 2022 we booked the Escape Lounge in Terminal 2. Unfortunately due to the storms in the UK we were delayed as roads were closed due to flooding and fallen trees making it impossible to get to the lounge on time. Not only were we delayed due to the floods, Manchester Airport queues to check in were rediculous and even longer queues to get through security resulting in not being able to go in the lounge. The reception staff at the lounge informed us we would be able to get a refund. Not the case as yet.As soon as we returned from our holiday we reported the problem and was even given a case ID number. After many more emails we still haven't received a response. We are now in October ! Terrible customer service.",1
26,"Only giving one star as not an option for no stars. We flew home on the 23rd of August to find our car parked using the drop and go service had been damaged. Guy took photos and said they would investigate and reply with 10 days. Given email to contact if this didn't happen which we contacted only to have a ""we will reply within 10 days"" response with no reply yet again. Car was parked as it someone had abandoned it.",1
27,Disgusting member of staff from swissport (Chris woodcock). Scaring my young daughter to the point she was in tears. Telling us she wasn’t disabled even though she had a daffodil lanyard around her neck. He wants sacking!,1
28,Awful ques going out and appalling they don't have enough staff to open the aircraft doors when returning. Kept us on the plane 40 minutes at 2am. We will probably travel using another airport next time,1
29,Me and wife just came back from lanzote on 2nd October it was bad for us this time going and coming back and when u complain they just ignore all the complaints.,1
30,"Disaster is too good a description for this disgusting experience in T1. Cost £5 to be dropped off ! My wife and I are over 80 and it took nearly 2 hours to go through security. Ridiculous manual checks of hand luggage, insufficient officious staff and the security rammed full of travellers- nearly missed flight. Then we had to carry our cases up and down narrow dirty stairs. Duty free had more staff than security DON’T USE THIS DISGUSTING PLACE - What an advert for foreign travellers ! TRAVEL from Liverpool if you can",1
31,"By far the worst airport I've flown out of. Very expensive parking, you are even charged to drop off and pick up. Security is lax and disorganised, 3 times the amount of staff in the duty free shop than in Security. Lack of maintenance and investment in the buildings and infrastructure. Friday afternoon and half the restaurants are closed. Do yourself a favour and fly from Liverpool John Lennon.",1
32,TERRIBLEHaving travelled the world this was by far the worst airport I have transitioned through to say the least. The Security is awful it was literally like being herded like cattle! A security man spent at least the 20 minutes of queuing shouting at people like an SS officer it was extremely unnerving and one person near me likened it to scenes in a movie where Jews were being herded into cattle carts (they were not far off!)! The extreme nature of the security was too much especially compared to other airports sending people the whole way back as punishment for forgetting things like a lipstick or a charging doc or wires like phone chargers!! A heavily pregnant lady was shouted at and demanded she removed her boots they would not allow her to even sit down to do so!! To say I was appalled would be an understatement. Poorly done Manchester,1
33,I have travelled all over the world including many third world countries. This is the worst airport ever. The security took forever - bags were taken out for manual search - and the staff were undermanned and very uneffecient. The airport itself looks like …. Avoid it if you can.,1
34,"Wow if you are looking for a an outstanding example of poor planning poor execution and downright incompetence this is the place for you. Is so bad is almost good, from the terrible website to the  awful staff this place has it in spades. If this was a real business with real competition it would be dead an buried, but it’s not, so welcome to the grave yard of ambition and stand by to take one straight up the tail pipe and expect to pay through the nose. Welcome to England.",1
35,"SPECIAL ASSISTANCE - what assistance?Booked as husband wheelchair bound - can walk a few steps but aided. At Term 1 girl on desk too busy flirting with men to actually look at boarding pass then asked if I could push him through!! As queue was very long so did as wtg for someone to do it would take forever. Took 1.5 hrs to get through security no help at all. Then when boarding had to push to gate, finally had help to get on plane via ambulift.Return journey worse on arrival at Term1 - was last but one to get off plane - young girl brought a wheelchair and just stood there chatting not helping him, I had to gather 2 bags, stick, coats then drop them to help him onto wheelchair whilst she just stood there, then told me that I could push him plus baggage to passport control (long long walk) !!!Then to carousel to get wheelchair and when got down there she was sat on chair having a rest!!! My husband and I are both 73 yrs he has had stroke so paralysed one side, openheart surgery and broken hip - this young blonde girl was about 19/20 yrs and she was a lazy lazy person. Plus two other young assistance people were sat around on mobile phones laughing and giggling. This was on Easyjet flight arriving 13.25 19 Oct.A warning to all disabled persons - DO NOT EXPECT HELP AS YOU WILL BE VERY DISAPPOINTEDWe fly around 3 times a year from Term 1 and it is always same so do not think will bother booking assistance again.Other countries we go to have fantastic one-one help and are great - Manchester worst airport EVER",1
36,Probably my worst experience at an airport. Most of the restaurants were closed. The only one open wanted you to order your food from an app but the Wi-Fi and 4g was so weak that you could not process the order. Very few staff and huge wait times for food. Flying is no longer an adventure when you are treated like cattle.,1
37,"Car parking is a rip off!!!In this time of economic crisis, didn't know the airport will be so greedy",1
38,The automated self-check in for Qatar Airways at Terminal 2 is awful and obviously has been brought in without sufficient staff training. This needs to be addressed asap. Our daughter in law and 8 year old granddaughter had to wait in 2 long queues and their weren't enough trained staff able to help.,1
39,Travelled through T3 this morning the 2nd October. After queuing for security for 45 minutes through what can only be described as a maze the end line was almost in sight. What we didn’t bargain for was one of the officers randomly selecting passengers for what was obviously a faster check point. This resulted in passengers who were at least 10-15 minutes behind us in the queue passing us out and getting through security ahead of us. They make it up as they go along. I have flown through Manchester many times and it is miles behind Heathrow in every aspect. Grotty and run down. If you can avoid it like the plague.,1
40,"I could just quote every negative point previously described from most of late passengers.....rude staff, no organization, 2 people yelling at us ( not remembering that they have a job thank to us), slow and late service...ages at the check in, ages at the controls, ages to get into the plane. A lot of rudeness in the middle. Avoid",1
41,"This airport does wonderful things for UK and Manchester Tourism.  They compare equally to airports in Afghanistan, Belurus and Ethiopia.  The security people are so wonderful as to create their own rules for the safety of the traveler.  They were kind enough to create signage directing people around that PHD's could understand.  Manchester Airport to me is as hemorrhoids are to a fat obese Manchester Airport Security Manager.  With Love - a traveler who loves Manchester's low class systems ...",1
42,"Not enough eating places - queues were all massive. A distinct lack of options (or. none) for a coeliac like me. The worst problem is the complete lack of toilet facilities - too few and far between for the volume of passengers. Also, why don't the men's loos have rows of urinals (or indeed any urinals at all in some of them)? This is basic design. A toilet with just 2 x cubicles is useless in a place this busy.",1
43,"What an absolute disgrace this place is, massive queues at all food outlets, clearly not enough to cope with passenger numbers. We did without as they were moving so slowly.The toilets around the departure gates were not fit for purpose, doors missing, locks missing, urinal overflowing and no toilet paper in 4 toilets I tried.",2
44,"Departing from this is a nightmare! They are clearly understaffed, the staff seemed stressed and the passengers weren't helping. Hopefully I'll never have to experience departing from this airport again. You also need pay £1 for the trollies which was a nightmare.",2
45,"What a shambles of a place! Don't ever fly from Manchester. Rude staff, not helpful at all. An small old man who just shouts at everyone. If you hate your job that much just leave! Just an awful set up with no organisation. AVOID!!!Would rather walk then fly from Manchester!!",1
46,Booked to go out at 6 am Sept 16th to Croatia. Airport very disorganised with long queues. Check in chaotic. Staff behind counters waving to tell people to go and check in. No organisation at all. On return 23 Sept. We had to wait 1.30 minutes for bags to arrive on belt. No member of staff about to ask or to Inform passengers what the problem was. A plane which had arrived after our flight saw their bags come off quicker. The service is extremely poor at this airport,1
47,We went through priority screening. The attendant totally stopped our line for 40 minutes to allow for another line to proceed due to a flight delay . We missed our plane. We had to buy new tickets and leave out at 630 at night after missing our 700 am flight.  This was clearly mismanagement. We told the officer several times we were going to miss our flight. Many other people also missed their flight due to this stoppage.,1
48,"Arriving at Terminal 2 departure lounge, it's 6pm Sunday and everything is closed apart from wh Smith,  appalling. Can't get any food apart from rubbish prepared sandwiches, it's 2022 arghhh....",2
49,"Terminal 3 - Manchester AirportYou couldn’t get more inefficient if you try. The process you will be subjected to is similar to most airports but has a twist at every stage:1. Check in with any bag that is not a solid case and you have to re queue to put it on a different belt. Takes 30-45mins2. Security staff are incredibly rude and are inept. Priority security takes 60-90mins.3. Food and drink. Nowhere to sit, lounges are full and dirty.4. Boarding. If you make it through the 3 stage hurdles, well done.",1
50,What a joke this airport is. Well over 90 minutes for cases. The flight from Canada was excellent and on time. All Canadian passengers could not believe how appalling the service was.. the baggage enquiries simply said ‘average time for luggage is 90 minutes from the plane landing’It never used to be like this. I am surprised the airlines don’t refuse to pay the fees,1
51,Arrived from Vienna...plane waited 18 minutes on the apron for an off loading gate to be made available. Finally got off the plane and walked down the dirty stained corridors. Security was relatively ok. Baggage carousel was a nightmare. Waited 2 hours for bags to arrive. No staff at all to offer explanation. Spoke to a man in a swissport outfit through the rubber screen at the head of the carousel.. rude rude rude man.. told me and others to P ... Off! A riot was very close to erupting.Shall never use Manchester airport again. A disgusting dirty hovel. Was utterly embarrassed for any Austrian visitors. This airport emphasises everything that is horrid about the UK at the moment. I will be happy to spend more in future and use Birmingham or Heathrow even Gatwick with more professional organisation. AVOID MANCHESTER AIRPORT.,1
52,"Terminal 2 is a disaster. Got through to the terminal at 3:45amRammed full of people and only 2 places open to eat or drink. Massive queues for those places and those that were opening at 4. Some of them not opening until 5 or later!Not enough seats for people to sit on. Not enough toilets - massive queues. I understand this terminal has recently been refurbished and what a disaster it is. Why on earth are they putting thousands of people in a terminal with food and drink venues that aren’t open, and not enough seating or toilets. Really poor planning.Next time I’ll be flying from a different airport.",2

54,"Absolutely terrible and getting worse. I recently flew to Bahrain for work - within two hours, I'd go through security, got my bags, checked into my hotel, and had a swim before heading off for dinner.At Manchester Airport it took 30 minutes for someone to be able to connect the stairs before we could even get off the plane.  It then took another two hours before our bags were available - two hours! Shocking - avoid if at all possible - a national embarrassment.",1
55,"This is now a regular occurrence. Your plane arrives at Manchester - the airport tell them where to park- in this case it’s on the apron requiring buses and guess what there are no buses available. We have now been waiting nearly 40 mins for a bus. Why didn’t they (MAA) use an airbridge, negating the use of buses. If they insist on using buses and why are there only 4 buses for the whole airport. You could not make this farce up",1
56,"Got dropped off by a taxi earlier this week. The best airport experience we've ever had which did surprise us. The airport staff at the drop off point were welcoming and helpful, as soon as we got in the building all the staff were helpful, friendly and chatty, everywhere we went, right through to getting on the plane. Great selection of shops with pretty standard prices. I can't believe how stressless it was.",5
57,"Used Terminal 2 which appears to have doubled in size with lots more places to eat and drink. Unfortunately, every single place has a huge queue with a long wait (how can this be the case when it wasn’t when it was half the size - something wrong with the operation) - we waited about 40 mins for fast food (sit down restaurants were a no go). Then when we landed about 5am this morning we had to wait on the tarmac for almost an hour for a bus. Apparently only two bus drivers available.  Crazy.  It’s an amazing airport just very very badly run",1
58,Even with small security queues at T2 it took me an hour to get through - they had staff but they were recalling 50% (yes half!) of bags for reinspection in some lanes.Very few toilets - 2 cubicles for men and two urinals in the main departure area of T2.Internet very poor /virtually impossible to get signal. No phone signal.Just poor for a brand new terminal!,1
59,"Terminal 1 drop off £6 for a 45 seconds stop. Sunday teatime flight. Baggage drop off fine - 15 minutes max and passport check was too. Security staff were rather assertive but we thought we'd got through pretty quickly until one bag was stopped in the machine for further checking. Had to wait in another queue for a further twenty minutes with people who were beltless, shoeless and wondering what was happening. Only two people were dealing with these. When our bag finally turned up the staff didn't even ask us about it and just handed it over -  just another delay.Eating facilities were appalling - limited, dirty, food and waste on the tables with hardly anyone cleaning up so we had to move rubbish to sit and eat a Burger King meal (which itself was bad).Almost all the shops were closed.Long, long walk to the aircraft with hand baggage. No travelators whatsoever! Gate area not large enough for the number of passengers - OAPs were sat on the floor or standing for nearly an hour before boarding.Another long walk on our return including up and down stairs. Herded like sheep back and forth in a very long queue to the e-passport booths, but they couldn't identify me from my passport so had another twenty minute wait with similar irate people to see a real person before being let back into the UK.Two baggage belts in use for the flight so had to keep dodging between them to find our bags. Final insult was a charge for a luggage trolley. Couldn't believe it. Absolutely disgusting. What a terrible impression for visitors. We had no English coins so had to manhandle all our very heavy cases to the pick up car park. Part of the route isn't covered but fortunately it wasn't raining too hard. Our son arrived to pay another £6 for a two minute stay. The exit payment machine card scanners were not working.Manchester Airport - Terminal 1 anyway - is a disgrace to the UK and an embarrassment to the north west. I wouldn't go there by choice but there's no alternative unless you're flying budget airlines. I believe it's run by local authorities. It needs privatising and massive investment to bring it up to standards elsewhere in the world. The online flight information is poor too. You can find the flight but there seems to be no status information and you are always referred to the airline.",1
60,Delayed going out due to various airport related issues. Delayed coming back due to the plane leaving Manchester late due to airport related issues. Waited for an hour for bags. Third world airport service,1
61,"Possibly the worst airport I've travelled through. Even local airports in the developing world are better than this: rude and aggressive security, chaotic layout and signposting, dirty facilities, bored and dismissive staff, food outlets than only sell drinks (ran out of food - really???). The owners say they have a plan and it's on track. The problem is, it was like this prepandemic and, if anything, is getting worse.",1
62,"Very disappointed at the lack of eateries, and the ones that are here have a distinct lack of choice.  Arrived for an afternoon flight, queued outside first restaurant for around 20/30 minutes only to get to the front to be told “no breakfasts available”. Went to the restaurant next door, again queued for 15 minutes or so, only to find all day breakfast stops serving at 11.00am.  Not a lot of choice, outside of sandwiches & snacks from general coffee. shops.  Dreadfully disappointed for a major terminal. Nothing like T1. Positive is that passing through Jet2 baggage drop & security was speedy & efficient.",3
63,Unable to obtain food queues too long early morning flight not enough food outlets in terminal two horrible experience the old terminal was far better one outlet open for drinks but not food eventhough there was a chef behind counter we had 2 year old to feed ridiculous,2
64,"Manchester airport used to be excellent for flying too and from, but it is all about trying to rip people off by drop off charges. The whole layout is confusing, which bodes well for the healthy fines they will dish out, if you accidentally stop in the wrong stop, whilst negotiating the maze. Using the short stay car park for terminal one for meet and greet is is just rediculous, the old quick in and out was superb, but obviously not a cash cow. My advice is use Liverpool John Lennon or Leeds and let this place rot.",1
65,"This used to be a good airport. Now it is dirty, dated and not up to the job. We arrived early and paid for fast to track to ensure getting a meal before boarding as my husband needs a gluten free diet, and Easy Jet don't offer anything. We missed the fast track lane and wondered how, but two other passengers also missed it because it was poorly signposted, so we had to queue. Duty free was quite poor given the size of the airport. (Heraklion was smaller but with better options.) Finally only two restaurants were open (2pm) and the queues were long. By the time we got to the front we were told it was minimum 35 mins for food and even 25 mins for just a drink. We ended up having to leave, after queuing, to avoid missing our boarding. My husband did not get his meal and was lucky that Starbucks offered one GF option in their sandwich range. On top of all this the airport feels dirty and outdated. This experience should be 'the start of your holiday'. Instead it left us feeling that in future we will try and fly from John Lennon Airport.Oh and the £6 drop off fee is extortionate!!",2
66,"Not a good experience at Terminal 1, both departing and arriving. Security at departure was appalling, having basically had to empty the majority of the contents of our hand luggage into a tray, and checking with the attendant that the remaining items were ok , we then had to wait 20 minutes following rejection of our case due to a small container of soluable asprins.Return was made difficult trying to find the correct place to meet our taxi collection. Sign posting is very poor and when you do get there it is part of a multi story car park and absolute chaos. For which the cheeky so and so's charge you £6.00Going from Manchester suited us this time, but we would definitely do our best to avoid it in future.Paul and Sue Bishop",2
67,"This is the worst airport I’ve ever been to and for the record I’ve been to airports all over the world and every continent and this is the worst of them all. Many unnecessary, long queues, took me over an hour to even get to the security check and the air conditioning was horrific. Jam packed security even tho it wasn’t necessary.",1
68,"My flight arrived from Jamaica to Manchester on time. We spent one hour on the plane after landing because we could not disembark because there was no staff available to attach the walkway used to get us off the plane, as a result a passenger had a panic attack. The pilot did his best to keep us informed but couldn’t give us a time when the situation would be resolved.After waiting for an hour to get off the plane, we waited for another hour to get our luggage and as a result we missed our transport home.During the time that we were waiting for our luggage, there was no member of staff available to give an account for the delay in our luggage being taken off the plane.The most annoying thing is that some passengers who flew on the same flight go their luggage quickly and then everything stopped for about 50 minutes and then suddenly started again?Manchester Airport get your act together!!I understand there is a shortage of staff but this has been the situation for too long!",1
69,"If you want to witness incredibly inept management I suggest you fly from this airport. Clearly this cost cutting ""management"" put their customers behind profit. Manchester Airport has had several months to get back to normal working levels yet they are overseeing personified chaos.",1
70,"I was expecting a bad experience to be honest, I was prepared for lengthy queues etc. But it was fine. The staff were in good spirit and the wait for security checks were fairly reasonable. We sat down quite quickly for food and staff there were lovely too.",4
71,"Flew in from Munich early hours, to rude and slovenly security. Dirty and litter strewn corridors, toilets that looked like they hadn't been cleaned for days and a general atmosphere, that made it feel like you were an inconvenience to the staff.Why is customer service at this run down, overpriced and badly maintained so called ""International Airport"" so bad? About time the management stopped taking less then minimum standard as the normal and started to take pride in their job. One star purely for the smiling border security bloke",1
72,"After a 10 hour flight we waited 90 minutes to get stairs to the plane, then another 30 minutes for a single bus to empty a huge Dreamliner, then had to wait 4 hours for our bags to be taken off the plane, this airport is beyond awful, who is running this shambles?Disgraceful! Going to Liverpool from now on.",1
73,"Very little staff, very busy terminal, machines broke on terminal 2, staff stood around taking. Had a very bad feeling about the whole thing and lo and behold both of our suitcases were lost and never put on our tui flight from terminal 2",1
74,"I was so impressed with Manchester airport yesterday. We were through baggage and security within no time, no queues, super attentive staff. They’ve had a tough few months with staff shortages but they’ve clearly turned this around and that effort needs to be commended as that was the smoothest airport journey I’ve ever had! Thank you",5
75,"I live in Manchester 10 minutes drive from the airport. If I fly to Europe I use Liverpool airport. If I fly to the USA I drive down to Heathrow, as I did last week. Anything is better than using this place.",1
76,Worst airport in the country and I have travelled from pretty much all of them. No excuses about the pandemic as it was an absolute mess before the pandemic. Needs a deep dive review and those running it should walk away as they are terrible at their jobs.,1
77,"This place is where nightmares are born, staff at the security shouts at you like you're in a prison. No space to sit down, absolute chaos and no organisation. The absolute worst experience you could possibly get at the airport. Shame on you.",1
78,Worst airport in the world. The security is ridiculous- even on a calm day it takes hours. They reject 95% of luggage! How is the security!!! INCOMPETENT,1
79,"Travelled from T2 for the first time since refurbishment. Getting through security is a shambles. They designed the X-ray arch too near the security belt where you unload your valuable positions, this results in me trying to put my stuff in the trays while people are trying to get passed through the X-ray arch…..crazy.Then try and find your valuables which have reached the other side long before you. Passport, money, phones, computers. Mine ended up well away from the belts at the pick of anyone. Very bad. Why can’t you accompany your valuables. The terminal is like a complicated shopping mall, hard to see the connection to flying.",2
80,Absolutely brilliant service.My husband and I felt so looked after by Karen at Take Flight tonight. She was so friendly and professional. The food was great too. We walked out of the Italian ( terminal 3) because of the 50 minute wait for food… and we were so pleased we did as the staff in Take flight were great. Definitely worth a visit if you are in  Terminal 3 . Thank you. Sara and David,5
81,"It's Friday afternoon.  The airport is packed.  There was no wait at all at security,. Brilliant.  However. The giraffe bar was closed for the day. No explanation.  This pit extra pressure on all the other bars which again were packed.  Now we are flying again they need to review terminal 1 facility",3
82,Arrived at T2 lunchtime. Long queues for all food and drink outlets. All seating around the departure lounge full so had to stand for nearly three hours. Too many shops selling things you don't need- get rid of them and change them to pubs/restaurants. Our T2 experience was not a part of the holiday as it should of been. Will not travel from this airport again. Zero star s.,1
83,"I have used the assistance help many times at Manchester airport at all terminals, and I can never praise the service enough.They are friendly professional chatty and humourous.They do there job efficiently, taking all the stress out of getting to the plane.Well done and thank you for the assisstance you have given me over the years and many more trips in the future.On the other side of the coin, the same service at the countries I have flown have also been good, but language can be a bit of a barrier, but it's fine.Lastly the coordination between travelling both ways us also a triumphant experience.",5
84,"Used terminal 1,with easyjet.Chaos, just to get to luggage desk.Chaos at security.Returning to terminal 1, Pathetic,On entering the baggage hall, hundreds of passengers waiting fot their luggage . Some had been waiting for two hours.No Information, an bags strewn , all over the the floor.That was so bad, that when airport staff, where helping wheelchair passengers through the baggage hall. They could not move.The management of this Airport is non- existent .Too many Planes at the same time.Why doe the Airport employ so many people that have no idea, about the job they are being paid for.I WILL NEVER USE THIS AIRPORT AGAIN< EVEN THOUGH TIS WILL LIMIT MY HOLIDAY DESTINATIONS",1
85,"Filthy airport, overcrowded and unhelpful staff. The airport was heaving to the point you seriously question safety. Fire exits are blocked in some cases by orange barriers.",1
86,"Possibly the worst airport in the world for baggage handling.Landed from dubai on ek019 at about 19.00. When we got through immigration loads of cases on carousel, just kept going round and round with  no new bags being put on or just a few at a time. Took 90 minutes to get our bags and still about 50% of people still waiting when we left. Never anyone in authority to speak to.They can't blame covid measures as it has been like this loads of times in last 20 years. Nobody gives a toss about customer satisfaction at this airport.All airlines get bad press but it seems to be all down to Manchester Airport management (or lack of it). Disgraceful that they can get away with it while ripping people off who have come to collect passengers at £12 an hour for pick up parking. They are just making money out of their incompetence.",1
87,"Manchester Airport T2 3am in the morning. Everywhere is shut, you can't buy a coffee or any sort of drink anywhere never mind food.All the blue comfortable soft chairs where filthy with food and drink stains, and I mean everyone. The wife refused to sit on any and sat on wooden slat chairs instead. The toilets! Well I wouldn't let my dog use them. They were worse than filthy, they absolutely  stunk and had not been cleaned for it looked like weeks.This is a brand new Terminal only recently opened and Manchester airport authorities should be ashamed of themselves.God knows what impression this airport gives to foreign travellers.",1
88,"Absolutely atrocious experience. Arrived in T3 last night- shunted into massive 'family queue. One surly person on the passport desk. Staff passing the buck. The place is a mess, filthy, and chaotic. The management clearly despise passengers. I've been using the airport for a decade and it's getting worse all the time. Mostly, I am a regular business traveler and it makes me want to move from Manchester. Using this airport regularly is not viable.",1
89,"The best thing about this airport is leaving it, flying somewhere nice I to a proper clean airport. The moving walkways from/to the train station still not working. Public toilets smelly an unclean. Security a chaotic shambles as always.Parking confusing with extortionate prices even for drop off/pick up.As a Mancunian, I am embarrassed and sick of apologising to friends from overseas.",1
90,"I can’t believe how bad a airport can be! The staff seem to be on a go slow especially in security where they where pulling bags aside for the most finicky things, including my own bag which had a eye shadow in   (Not a liquid) while I waited for my bag, I noticed the guy checking the bags for liquid was Very racist. Me & my partner noticed 2 incidents in the 20 mins we stood there!",1
91,Must be the most useless airport in the world. Plane ready to go when we were told no bags loaded. Twenty minutes later told the loading team had finished their shift and there was not a replacement team at the moment. Nearly an hour waiting and still no bags loaded,1
92,Terminal 3 services and cleanliness is appalling. 4 trips in the past month all the same. No where to eat without a 15 minute queue. No where to sit. 10 minute queue for the toliet. Manchester airport you are becoming a joke I will take my custom elsewhere if this continues.. what is your plan,1
93,"Where in the world is it OK to charge £6 to drop and pick family up from the airport.  Wasting time,  money and causing emissions by making us drive round a silly circuit to Warrant this payment. Why is it OK because its being advertised to Rob people in this way like its OK because its not. This is just one complaint but can reverberate across the whole airport and its creative charging regimes!!!",1
94,"Came back from Menorca on a Tui flight full of families. Arrived at security, everyone with children asked to join a queue, waited over 40 minutes, with just one person on the desk checking passports, when there were 4-6 for international arrivals. It was around lunchtime, alot of children clearly hungry and fed up. From a customer service perspective it's just so so poor. We then waited at our luggage carousel for over an hour for our bags. Appreciate this isnt directly Manchester airports fault, more the luggage handler, but come on this is all basic stuff. We've had a really good holiday yet it feels tainted by the experience back at MCR airport.",1
95,"My review is based on Terminal 1 centered on Overcrowding, Uncleanliness and a terrible Lost Property dept. Clearly the old terminal has lost any sort of real funding during the improvements made to T2/T3. Firstly, they are constantly overwhelmed both at carry on screening and restaurants too. Bottles of water strewn all over the floor with poor sanitation. We had the unfortunate mishap of leaving a coat in Bar MCR. When calling the venue, a young server said she had found it and handed to ‘security’…….that was a month ago. Obviously we will never see it again.  It’s the terminal from hell I’m afraid",1
96,Horrible experience. The security area felt like we were in a cattle shed and people were scrabbling to get through very little space. They purposely make security and drop off difficult just to try and make money off you. I'll go via another other airport next time even if it take half an hour longer to get there...,1
97,"AwfulParked in multi storey T1, ended up at top level in the open, small space to park. Lifts useless would not come to top level so had to drag cases down stairs.Demeaning security, totally otp went beyond government guidelines creating massive security queuing, staff barking at people, regaling stories of how they’ve chucked people out for having the nerve to ask what seemed a civil question, power mad. A totally unnecessarily  stressful time very poor. Flew from Leeds Bradford prev week - a very straight forward and friendly experience.",1
98,"I don’t know what happened to Manchester airport but I find the situation I am currently in ridiculous, I am flying from T2 and it’s 7pm my flight has been delayed two hours but regardless departure was 7:50 and all the restaurants shops and bars are closing… the only establishment open is Bridgewater Exchange and a sign at the door ‘please wait to be seated’ with no host, self seating no table service but no body explaining what is happening!!! What a joke to the start of our holiday!!! The restrooms are ok for an upgrade but unkept and unsanitary! I bet a lot of money went into the upgrade that this is incredibly disappointing!",1
99,"Had a very positive experience after feeling anxious because of recent reports. The terminal (1) was very well staffed and all staff were cheerful and helpful. There was a queue at security but I've never known any airport not to have queues there, including pre-covid and pre-brexit. We were through security in half an hour, perfect! Due to spending too much time in Duty Free, we opted for a Starbucks drink and breakfast roll which were served quickly and was very nice. Flight left only a couple of minutes behind schedule and all bags were on board in a timely manner. Will definitely book Manchester airport flights again.",5
100,It’s a British Major airport and an embarrassment to the country what foreign visitors must think 2 and a half hours for baggage collecting just an embarrassing airport .,1
101,"The pickup arrangements at terminal 2 are little short of a joke. They charge exorbitant rates, set very poor standards, and fail to achieve them. Sod the customer, just look at the money they can make!!",1
102,"Flew from Terminal 2 twice in the last 6 weeks and I have to say considering they are short staffed , I didn’t have 1 problem. Probably get all the flack from the airlines not employing enough staff after covid so I thought they deserve a compliment ⭐️",5
103,"Absolutely filthy – a total disgrace after waiting years for a major upgrade – you cannot blame the pandemic for ever, every part of the Airport was in dire need of a serious clean.  The Golden Square in Warrington is years old and is better designed and spotless, it is also a shopping centre which is what your new main area resembles – this is not the Airport we were promised!I suggest you hire someone from there immediately and dismiss whoever is responsible for this absolute embarrassment.Huge queues to even gain entry to Restaurants etc. And the prices are ridiculous £47 for a £10 bottle of Prosecco – and by the way “Master Brewers” do not serve overpriced beer in plastic cups whilst ignoring the Glasses behind the counter",1
104,What a nightmare arrived in terminal 3 and no luggage for 40 minutes then we had to get to terminal 2 where our car was parked told it would take 15 mins to walk absolute joke it took 45 minutes and no skyline escalators working why have them if they don’t work spoilt what was a great holiday we won’t be using Manchester again no staff to ask either .,3
105,"Shuttle service to car rental says every 10 minutes, but one tends to wait 15-20 unless you’re very lucky I waited 20mins today",1
106,Waited 2hours 30 mins for baggage handlers to take my suitcase off the plane.Airport should take responsibility.Also £6 for 5 min drop off charge is extortionate.I could go on.....,1
107,"This place is an absolute disaster.Food and toilets are a disgrace, but that's been said in other reviews and I agree.Our outward bound plane had no cleaners, after an hour and a half the cabin crew cleaned the plane (thank you for doing this) and asked if we were prepared to leave in a ""dirty plane"", or course we did. Still another 30+ minute delay as we had no one to push us out of the airport and more time waisted waiting for a slot.Coming back an airbridge was not available so we had to wait for a single set of steps, which took another 30 mins as we waited in the runway for 30 mins before that, and then another hour and a half getting through customs thanks to staff shortages and those who voted for Brexit :(Parking is a joke and everyone was using the carpark to avoid the massive pick up parking cost hike, which   caused chaos and massive delays.I will never fly from Manchester Airport again, so glad our children are grown up and I pitied those with little ones.",1
108,"Flying out from T3. The airport was busy as expected and we arrived early to allow for delays. It is quite obvious that they have staff shortages in all areas. The bathroom was disgusting and our flight was early in the morning, so no excuses. The staff is frustrated and seem to express that when interacting with travellers. Impolite and abrupt to travellers that paid quite a lot for their summer holidays - no longer budget holidays - with the service available being below basic.",1
109,"Oh my goodness has to be the worst experience at an airport.  Security awful, they say short staffed however I counted 5 doing nothing. One poor lady complained and the 2 gents just laughed. No manners. Toilets dirty sink overflowing felt dirty. Think ill need to find another way to Manchester",1
110,Went to Starbucks for a coffee waded through the filthy floors sat on filthy chairs had to put my coffee on a filthy tableStaff were really good no complaints,1
111,Flew out of Manchester on 24/7/2022 and the lack of staff was pitiful. No one controlling the queues and it was dreadful. On arrival back to Manchester 8/8/2022 and again waiting for the cases for 1hr 45 mins. The place was so unclean with dust covering the floor and litter all over the place.,1
112,"From recent reviews, I know that I am not alone in being utterly appalled by Manchester Airport. Having travelled through Manchester Airport many times in the past, I know how challenging the work of airport staff can be but their car park charges are a complete joke. £5 to drop someone off, for 5 minutes. Disgraceful. £12 to pick someone up whose plane had landed 90 minutes before. (Only £6 if you can get out in 30 minutes... ONLY £6!) The tardiness of airport staff appears to be deliberate and the attitude of staff members... better if we don't go there! No wonder drivers are stopped on the roundabout close to the airport.Manchester Airport - a huge FAIL !",1
113,Long wait at security. An extremely unpleasant experience.Terminal 2 toilets are dirty and inadequate.Unfortunately there is no alternative but to use this dreadful airport but I would avoid if you can,1
114,"Booked Meet and Greet Manchester T2 for 11 nights, upon collection today a front tyre was completely flat. The car was fine on drop off and had driven 40 miles there. Meet and Greet called out assistance who inflated the tyre and then sent us on our way. 5 miles later on the M56 flat again. I had a 4 and 6 year old who hadn't slept on an overnight flight now in a dangerous situation. We eventually got home and have ordered a replacement tyre with the car out of use for 24 hours.The car park they store the vehicles in is 2+ miles away.",1
115,"Absolutely shocking customer service today at Manchester Airport, Swissport weren't ready with the steps to allow disembarkation, and when they did turn up two chiefs then supervised the YTS lad who very slowly positioned the steps in place. To compound the dreadful service, UK Border only had two desks open, with a third member of staff directing people! Too many chiefs and not enough Indians! Not ideal after a long haul flight with young children! Unacceptable, as more staff are  required. Do not blame Covid, Brexit, BoJo or anyone else, if you take the money, provide the service!",1
116,Terrible security experience. Lots of staff but they hadn’t been trained and we’re not doing their jobs. I suggest the managers take a long hard look at what is happening. I am ashamed that this is an airport our visitors have to use.,1
117,"Security staff don't know what's going on they close gates,and reopen them again without telling people my 9 year old son had to go through a search because of a number on the back of his shirt, all airlines are helpful but the information staff are clueless",1
118,They are so disorganised and unhelpful. Waited 90 minutes for baggage. Always terrible. Had to be the worst airport in the uk base on my experience.,1
119,Just waiting at carousel for bags been here for 2 and half hours now so while am waiting thought ad let people no if your flight is with tui get ready for a long wait at Manchester baggage handlers don't think there is many understaffed and tui just not interested,1
120,"Firstly, paid for fast track security and passport control and upon arrival at security and passport control my fast track wasn't used. Secondly on arrival back to the UK the state of the toilets in T1 we're appalling. When visiting the toilets the floors were soaked with urine, feces were smothered all over the cubicle wall and the door to the cubicle didn't lock. To top all this off there were no staff around in any area to complain too. The premium lounges at Manchester T2 close very early and don't state they are full when booking online. We booked and paid online to be refused entry and couldn't get any food as ques were horrendous. Please don't fly from here. Unfortunately I have to come again.",1
121,"How can the airport still be this bad? We are nearing the end of August and you still haven’t got your act together. No excuses are valid anymore. Manchester airport is such an embarrassment and run by incompetent people who clearly have prioritised recruiting “customer assistants” who are utterly useless rather than essential ground staff. Waited 45 mins on the plane after landing because there was no “dispatcher” to unlock the terminal door. What a joke. All of your priorities are wrong, and you clearly do not care about your customers at all. Complete shambles at security too. Cramped, hot and overcrowded. Terribly run. Awful awful experience!",1
122,It’s a disgrace. I’m shocked how bad it is. It’s 6:45pm and there is only 1 place to get a meal and a drink. I will avoid in the future but really Manchester you need to up your game…,1
123,What a rubbish airport it's a shame how easy they can rubbing people in day light 👎👎👎Useless some of the staff are there It won't let me put zero star 😡I really hope next government do something about the airport 👎👎👎,1
124,"Worst airport for both leaving and re entering the UK, security rude when leaving and treated like cattle at all times - 2 hours of queuing each wayBorder security a joke!",1
125,"Got thru customs at 9.45 , duty free the only thing open. Got to the micro bar pub, sorry where closing in 30 minutes, seeing I was a bit miffed the lady at the front said go and get some drinks and you can take them out..  she explained they've been there all day , no staff to take over. Just can't get the staff.. paid £10 for fastrack through customs, didn't need it, no one there.. my advice would be pay for an escape lounge at least u can get a drink and a snack.  Manchester airport is a 24hour airport without 24 hour facilities,  poor....not a great start to a holiday. Couldn't even buy a book or magazine. Surely there's enough staff for one outlet to be open 24hours. The price of everything is very high too , obviously the wages aren't..",1
126,"Ridiculous drop off parking charges , staff completely useless ask a question but you don't get a satisfactory answer. The only person that could point us in the right direction was a Young lad from a car hire company.",1
127,A super extortionate parking place £6.00 just to turn round where’s health and safety just pure greed sorry but a fact,1
128,"I would like to give a zero but 1 star is lowest I could give. Simon team leader for Etihad, mushtaq khan and Melanie hadid (I think that was her name) were the worse people I have ever dealt with! No customer service skills and just plain rude and Melanie was aggressive! Sister travelled on Etihad airline today and the staff at the check in counter were the worse people I have ever come across, they were in our face pointing towards me and speaking so rudely! I will never travel on Eithad ever again and the management need to look into the complaint I’ve logged as that staff should not be customer facing as they made me feel so intimated and the children travelling were also very terrified with their behaviour! Can’t believe what happened today!",1
129,"One of the most disgraceful, embarrassing, disorganised airport experiences I have ever been exposed to ( including 15 years of third world Africa travelling) no process, no structure, no urgency, no flow just pure chaos, I noted in my 45 minutes wait for my children’s bag to - snail through the X-ray process there are cameras located in the area - I encourage responsible supervisors and managers of the X-ray area and senior management of the airport to review this footage between 11:30 and 12:30 01.10.22 digest the pandemonium both for your staff and customers… yes… I said customers who pay for these services as your currently operations are an embarrassment to your leadership - before anyone starts to chant about security… these comments are not questioning the virtues of security measures, I am outlining the diabolical approach and impacts - there are MANY airports in the world who’s equipment, processes and procedures simply remove / almost eliminate such chaos….. where has the self respect, pride, structure and - “getting it right” attitude - interest gone ?… also nothing to do with Covid or staff shortages… plenty of staff… purely equipment, processes and procedures - a disgrace that people get paid a salary to manage.",1
130,I have flown out from this airport 5 time in the past few years and it is slow from check in to security and the flights never take off on time you would think after 4 years you would be able to get you act together Manchester airport,1
131,"hTis airport should be closed down permanently. It is not fit for purpose and is a disgrace to the UK as the northern international airport. Pity anyone seeking mobility assistance. Myself and Blind daughter both had assistance booked. Going out ""Help"" yourself we have chairs but not staff. Coming back in ""No Chairs"" No staff. The long walk to passport control was a nightmare. This was in late June 2022. The same thing happened in February on a Virgin ""Upper"" Class ticket so the ticket cost has no influence on the service that Manchester Airport think is ok. Second class management, second class airport. Unless I have to I will never ever use again",1
132,"Probably the worst airport in the UK.As a regular business traveller I'm dismayed at how terrible Manchester airport now is.The following is a review of t2.It's abit like trainspotting the original was the best the sequel terrible.How can you complete a major upgrade and make it worse.Security is poorly laid out needs a redesign not efficient.Dirty not enough bins or seating.Not enough food outlets for volume of passengers , upwards of 2000 hungry people in the early morning with not a single vendor open.Complete lack of toilet facilities , 3 urinals and 6 sinks ? Who signed off on this it's ridiculous, never in any airport in the world have I ever had to que 10 minutes for a pee.Line up the project managers and fire them for shear incompetence.Manchester airport was just ok before not great but good enough.Now it's that much of a joke an extra 3 hour drive , now looks like the better option.",1
133,"Going out from T3 checkin and security no issues. However landing after a lovely break in Majorca off the back of a 3 hour delay we were supposed to land back at T3. Only to realise due to delay we had been dropped off at T1 but our luggage still went to T3. This resulted in a 3 hour wait for our luggage, no communication from staff or even staff to ask for help. AWFUL service and when we did finally find someone after 2 hour of waiting there response was to call security as a lot of frustrated passengers who just wanted to know where our luggage was and how long it was going to be until it arrived. Shocking customer service from airport and Ryanair",1
134,"My first time at MCR and it will be my last. On arrival, the prebooked parking system failed and I had to ask for help to open the barrier. The whole airport is a disorganised,  a clunky, confusing, counter intuitive mess. Signs everywhere often hard to spot and staff sending you in conflicting directions. It was like being in a Monty Python sketch, without the humour. It is the polar opposite of slick. I completely understand airport security, but I have never had my prescribed asthma inhaler singled out as a potentially risk. There is lack of seating in T2 and the catering outlets are completely overwhelmed resulting in long queues for everything. Catering signage like 'queue here to be seated' had us standing there pointlessly because the outlet didn't open for hours, confusing. Pricing of the shops, food etc is on par for an airport. The worst airport I have flown from, avoid if you can.",2
135,"Arrived at the meet and greet at T2, all quickly processed. Arrived at the TUI bag drop, lots of stood around but no one really ready to help. Our flight was delayed on both the outgoing and incoming journey. Our incoming flight drama was a complete joke. We were delayed by 2 hours, but the worst was yet to come! We waited on board for a good 30 minutes to disembark. We got to border control along with another flight, massive queues, few desks open and lots of unsettled children. Ours included. Arrived at the baggage reclaim and waited over an hour for the bags to start arriving. My children fell asleep on the floor waiting! Nobody around to offer any guidance of direction. Felt like no one was really in control of the situation, and more so not a single apology!",1
136,I was not satisfied with my experience of this airport. There was very limited staff available to help and it seemed that none of the staff was willing to offer any help. We were not able to travel either because we were told that we were too late for check in when in fact we still had an hour left. Felt that the person that was serving us was very disrespectful and not willing to help whatsoever. Would not recommend going abroad through this airport at all. Overall very disappointed with the customer service and hope that this is improved going forward. However. There was a staff that was called Nicole who tried to help us which we were more than grateful and felt that this was the only staff that tried to help us.,1
137,I wouldn't even give a 1 star but had no choice. We were held in check in que for 3 hours told to come 3 hours before our flight kept explaining to check in managers we had flight to catch.. they just said stay in que.. we got to security was a total nightmare I had carrots cut up in my bag and that made the security put my bag through 3 times the security is absolutely bellow any standards by any means every time they put our bags to the side we had to wait for someone to look at it and even if some one in front us let us go first as their flight was 2 hours later they just couldn't care... we Almost missed our flight because the stupid security and the check-in management POOR POOR SECURITY MANAGEMENT..TERRIBLE AIRPORT SECURITY IS DEFINITELY THE WORST FROM ANY AIRPORT IN THE WORLD..AVOID MANCHESTER AIRPORT IF YOU CAN,1
138,"What a absolutely stressful experience at departures terminal 3 Manchester ! 17/09/22 Check in with a holdall bag and you are sent off to queue elsewhere for ridiculous amount of time , staff don’t seem to know if you need to take your passport with you or not ! Security queues are the worst I have ever experienced, waiting horrendous length of time only to spoken to like a piece of dirt by rude abrupt security staff who expect us to know what we have to take off (eg cardigan ) , what trays we can take , no please or politeness just damn right rude ! If you want to eat good luck trying to find somewhere to sit !! Jam packed everywhere , huge lack of seating and restaurants  ,Some places to eat were actually shut ( lunch time ) , queues running through the middle of one restaurant just to get a drink never moved , I  gave up in the end . On return 24/9/22 we waited over 35 minutes to get out luggage  ! One case came out burst open / damaged with clothes / perfume bottle ,socks , toiletries all over the belt , disgraceful that this bag was even put on the the belt by the luggage handlers. ! This airport needs drastic changes . Never using this airport again . The worst one I’ve ever been to",1
139,"Hello to the chief executive.  Would you like me to run your airport for you .  I'm very experienced in logistics ,  please contact  me if you need help happy to oblige",1
140,"Landed on time on an Air Canada flight from Toronto. The Captain then announced that he was waiting for a gate. He didn't know which one, it depended on which plane pulled away first. We finally left the plane 45 minutes after landing. I think the gate was somewhere on the outer edge of the airport judging the length of the corridors we walked to get to passport control. Passport control was efficient. Baggage hall had several conveyors for flights that had landed well before us. It transpired that they had been waiting a very long time. Eventually, of the flights were told that their luggage would be another hour or they could fill in a form for it to be delivered to their home. The lack of information to all customers arriving was appalling. There were no visible staff and no facilities for the number of people having to wait, which included families with young children and elderly people who needed assistance. People had arrived after long flights and may have travelled for even longer prior to those flights. Very few seats to sit down. Where is the customer care?",1
141,I came by gulf air landed 8:37 then I reached baggage reclaim by 9:00 am waited for my luggage alongside with other passengers for 1hour and 40 minutes very very poor service,2
142,Really badly run. Only two lanes for security bag check. Queued for hour. and a half.. stocks in restaurants low. So many delays.,1
143,Once again Manchester airport!!!! Queue Queue Queue!!!! Even have to wait 1 hour for the bagage carrousel to start!,1
144,"We got through security quite quickly so no where near as bad as we were expecting and read. Clean and not too busy so would be 5/5 based on this part.When we arrived back at Manchester we had to pay £6 to get out as we got picked up. Feel robbed as imagine you had to pay £6 to get out of Tescos. Chaos as there were loads of people in a multi storey car park waiting for their lift and having to then run to a machine to pay. It used to be easy to get picked up  and the system is chaos and it used to be so easy. There are cars reversing down the entry to avoid paying, I have even seen someone walking down the motorway and there are threatening signs saying you will get charged £100 if you pick up in some areas. its complicated and profiteering and we were worried we were going to be charged £100 if we were picked up at the wrong place.",2
145,"Incompetent staff terrible organization and dirty toilets. The staff member helped me with my luggage printed 2 luggage labels accidentally then deleted the wrong one. I clearly saw they deleted the wrong one and I asked him to check. They were incredibly rude and said they would check in a few minutes after helping other customers. He just left so I called the supervisor told them what happened. Supervisor checked and sure enough the code on my bag was cancelled. The guy came back agitated and blamed me. Then security, went through and my bag was selected to be checked. Waited 30 minutes nothing found, just like the 3 people’s bags in front of me. Total lack of training and again rude staff. Went to the lounge to use my LoungeKey but guess what fully booked. Waited in line for food for 30 minutes. Food was inedible. Went to the toilet was filthy and the cleaner was outside on his phone and then left presumably they just cleaned it. All toilets were broken apart from 1 and I had to queue. Do not ever use this airport. I just went through Naples and it was a breeze, clean toilets, good food, happy competent staff.",1
146,"I am absolutely disgusted by this company. We returned from our holiday and there was a bump on the side of my car. We pointed this out straight away and the man there comforted me in that we would get it sorted. Also to point out my dash-cam had been unplugged for the duration of its stay and then conveniently plugged back in for our return- suspicious right, especially when you hear stories of the company using vehicles out of the car park. After bringing this up to the company they said soooo many excuses of why this was. Pathetic. Then we received an email describing how the bump was ‘convex’ so it couldn’t possibly be their fault… but I have no idea how they know this as the man hardly even felt it when the car was there. They then commented how they could get it assessed further but then we would have to pay. Absolutely ridiculous.DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY",1
147,"Absolutely useless, queues out of the doors.Rude, probably overworked and stressed staff.",1
148,"This is the second time we've flown out of Manchester T2 this year and it only gets one star because of check in and security, these were great. After that the whole airport experience is shocking! Its almost impossible to sit down in a restaurant and relax before your flight, the queues are horrendous! How is it possible to spend so much money on this upgrade and make it so bad. Why have they made it so cramped, there used to be loads of space. It's a busy airport why set it out as though its not! More bars, restaurants, food, drink, toilets, space needed. Maybe the airport design team should spend some time using the terminal every morning during school holidays and then travel to a number of other airports and see how they do it. If I had the choice I would always fly from somewhere else, and this hurts as I'm a proud Mancunian who loves his city. We're innovators and the city is outstanding, surely it deserves an equally outstanding airport!",1
149,"Tried to book an airport lounge on Saturday( for October) and the money was taken but no confirmation received.After finding a number to call I rang them but it said they were closed. I tried again this morning on two Airport numbers at the same time ( but ended up getting the same boring music and recorded message saying how proud they were to serve) After 35 minutes one line answered and confirmed all the details of the booking and said that payment received but booking didn’t go through.I asked why and he simply said “oh the system crashed”. I asked him if,rather than refunding the payment, if he would put the booking through again. He said he could but I would have to pay again and then wait for the original payment to be refunded. I asked, if he knew the booking hadn’t gone through,why there wasn’t an automatic refund but he didn’t know.However the bottom line is that had I not called they would have simply sat on my money.This is truly terrible customer service",1
150,"As a first time Traveller I was dreading coming to this airport after reading all the previous reviews. Arrived at 9am. However I have to say we sailed through without delay. Minimal queue at self bag check in, enough staff to ask as we didn't know what to do. Quick through security and served by a very pleasant man. Departure lounges very busy but again any staff we encountered were friendly. There was evidence of cleaning, the toilets need a bit more attention but given the amount of people a downturn in cleanliness can occur within 5 mins of previous cleaning. Signage from T3 multi car park could be better and at one point we thought there'd be no places left which adds to the stress levels. Ours might have been a unique experience but is this a sign they are starting to recover?Addendum, incoming flight late so consequently we were 2 hours late leaving, kept us sitting on the plane for 1.5 hours, airside ground crew and baggage handlers got the blame, did I speak too soon? Let's hope it gets better.",4
151,"We travelled to Croatia 17.09.22 for a  sailing holiday. My husband likes to take our own sailing life jackets…EasyJet says it’s ok, but not Manchester airport! Their security staff were completely OTT. What do they think are under the planes seats!! Life jackets!! It took my husband speaking to 2 senior  managers, who then spoke to EasyJet who said yes it’s fine! 2.5 hours stuck in the wrongly sized, ram packed, sweaty, germ ridden, inappropriately staffed and sized room which was over occupied by the public and quite possibly a bigger H&S risk in itself! Manchester Airport T1… filthy toilets, under staffed in amenity staff such as cleaners but over staffed in over made up duty free staff, chaotic scenes just for basic amenities such as food and drink…more like a 3rd world country! Returning the 1.10.22; airport dirty, no staff about and took nearly two hours for baggage to come thru. Confirmed by a baggage handler who, bless him, could barely speak. that only 4 baggage handlers on staff that night for whole of T1. Security guard was incompetent, knew nothing at all about who to call to see what was happening with the bags. Whilst we were queuing in extremely long customs queue, 2 EasyJet crew teams walked past, and one extremely camp as Christmas member of the flight team made an extremely inappropriate remark about us ‘peasants having to wait in such an awfully long queue’ and laughed, with a queen like wave at us all. Shame on EasyJet staff members who all laughed. All in all, Manchester airport is broken. Mis managed, under staffed, poor amenities and over inflated prices. Next time we’re going to JL, Liverpool, they’ve got it right!",1
152,"This is the worst airport in the world based on its size and importance and service it offers. Poor trained staff. No order. Dirty. New terminal 2 has more LED screens rather than food outlets. Not inclusive for families, all show fancy restaurants, who has the time or what to do with feeding a 8/9 year old. Fur coat no knickers. Worst security. Families with kids going to all-inclusive I'm Greece / Spain are just not terrorists so stop treating as so. Border control - pathetic. Not enough staff. All this place cares about is making money. The exploitation of parking charges is disgusting. Money making over safety. Making taxi drivers feel like criminals. Children forced to walk up parking ramps. Babies in pushchairs made to breathe taxi fumes and walk on roads to faraway pick up zones or pay ridiculous amounts to have drive taxir pick them up The management and CEO and board should leave and get out. This should be a municipal airport for the Manchester region.its not. It's just a cash cow and money making scam for greedy selfish executives It's a joke and the closet thing to hell on earth unsafe, unapproachable, racist, discrimatory. Please avoid at all costs.",1

155,"Firstly, if I could give no stars, then I would.We used Manchester Terminal 2 for our 06.10 flight to Majorca last week. Self checking in of baggage was a little better than when we did it in March, then it was chaotic. Going through security wasn't too bad, in fairness it was pretty quick, and the staff were pleasant. Then came the toilets, very few were working, dirty, no toilet paper, no soap, and this is at 4.00am, do they ever get cleaned? All areas after duty free, the food court, the passageways and the departure gate areas, were dirty. That brings me to the departure/gate staff - rude with a couldn't care less attitude. We came back from Majorca yesterday and disembarked at terminal 2. The Skybridge was dirty and full of litter. The toilets, again those that were working, are disgusting, dirty, no toilet paper. Passageways were still dirty. However boarder control was excellent, quick and again pleasant staff. Baggage reclaim was an absolute joke, 2hrs 20mins waiting for the bags to be unloaded. We found out that the Swissport baggage handlers, ALL FIVE of them, had 5 planes to unload which had landed within 15 mins of each other, so they did a great job. However, the same thing happened in March, 6 months ago. Covid is no longer an excuse, staff shortage and training is no longer an excuse, blaming contracted out servicing companies is no longer an excuse. What was once a great international airport is being managed by poor, incompetent, so called ""managers""If at all possible, I will never use Manchester airport again.",1
156,It's the first airport I have to wait 2 hours for the luggage to come out of the plane. Still waiting.,1
157,"Just arrived back from Rhodes having travelled on 27/08/22 and returning 07/09/22. Here are my thoughts…Started off by using T1 M&G and is worth every penny. Very well sign posted, and all staff were very useful and efficient.Now onto the main Terminal building, Like the vast majority of us this year, we fell into the trap of reading too much into the news and social media stories of how chaotic airports have been throughout the summer, and were somewhat anxious about what we would see when we arrived. It would seem that for every 100 people that travel through Manchester Airport, 99% of those users have a pleasant and seamless experience. It’s that 1% of bad experiences that the news and social media latch onto to make a big song and dance about (ringing any bells?).What we saw was a fully functional and completely normal Manchester Airport that we’ve used on countless occasions. Even with departing on a busy Saturday morning, we had no such issues with checking in or with security. Upon arrival back into Manchester, passport control and luggage collection was the same story also… spot on!My summary is this… please stop reading into the 1% of horror stories that make it to the false world of social media. I’ve definitely learnt my lesson. Arrive no earlier than what you need to, and hopefully this little insight will give you that crumb of comfort that you’ll be just fine😊",5
158,Sh!thole . No other way of describing this hell hole.,1
159,"Only giving one star as unable to give no star. What can I say about my experience today at terminal 2 security. Started off not too bad as queue didnt seem to long. Got through boarding pass gate with some assistance from a member of staff as my boarding pass wouldn't scan. Seemingly if your phone isn't on bright the scanner does not read the bar code. Once through that part theres a further queue to get to the security scanners. You have to queue behind other passengers about 3 deep so then once you get your belongings in a tray you then have to squeeze past people waiting behind you and queue to go through the body scanner. The next thing you know your trying to locate where your belonging have gone. At least 50% of the bags were going on another belt awaiting a second inspection. Almost every bag didnt really need a second inspection from what I witnessed. Once they didnt find anything wrong with your bags they decide to swab them. I asked why my bags had been put for second inspection as all my liquids were in a clear bag. No electricals were in my bag and they gave the lame excuse of too many coins in my purse WHAT!!!!! Never in all my travels have I experienced anything like it. Manchester airport, Terminal 2 your causing total chaos. I know security is important but too many coins in my purse, REALLY!! Seems you have some sort of dysfunctional quoter system. Please please management start sorting this out. No one will want to fly from Manchester at this rate.",1
160,terrible airport lost our luggage and then on the return flight cancelled leaving us stranded,1
161,"Ridiculous on every aspect: long queues, high charges, no staff. Avoid if possible!",1
162,"Ok so we required 2 wheelchair assistance for our party of 4adults 1 infant this was pre booked so you would think that something would have been put in place. Check in was aware and directed us to the assistance desk, they had no idea of our booking told us they had no one available but if we waited but it would be over an hour and they could not guarantee that we would be delivered in time for our flight. They suggested the other two of our party pushed the wheel chairs even though we had an infant in a push chair plus luggage for 4 people. Disgusted this was the choice we had to take. So we struggled onward on our own. It was the same story on our return journey the Spanish side of our assistance was brilliant. They had it all sorted no having to do it ourselves or wait long periods of time to even get a wheelchair never mind getting someone to push. At one point I had to give up and push my elderly mum in her chair even though I have bad mobility issues myself we had been separated from our family at this point as we were told to stay on the plane. We stayed so long there was a change of crew on board and 5 mins before boarding the next set of passengers. A crew member eventually dragged us in a wheelchair one by one to the seats at the end of the tunnel. To say I felt very vulnerable and upset is the very least. The pilots were both lovely and kept apologizing to us.I can't understand why something that was prebooked did not have anything put in place, it's not like we just turned up and went surprise we need wheelchair assistance. Very frustrated, humiliated, and physically exhausted by our experience. We were told it was not jet2 fault as it's a third party that arranges assistance. The 3rd party blamed jet2. !!!!",1
163,"In my wide travels by air this is indeed one of the very worst. It is an embarrassment to our country with a pathetic lack of clear signage, routes from landing bays back to the terminal running up and down flights of stairs, with few escalators and a small, cramped and terribly designed baggage retrieval area.The attention to designing an airport for customer access,  service and throughput is a disgrace.This is run by a consortium of local authorities including Manchester City Council and it gives a hugely negative view of how much they care for citizens of the area, this country and anyone unfortunate enough to have to travel through it.Regulation is needed and the City Mayor should do his job and knock the airport management heads together.Parking is expensive and although the new Drop and Go has an automated process signage to it back from  Terminal 1 is non-existent. Having asked several airport employees the way to walk it, some could onlypoint it out in the distance, none could tell us and several said they came across many travellers complaining to them they had wasted a long time on fruitless, uncertain  journeys across roads and roundabouts, frequently having to drag cases up high kerbs as noone had the foresight to plan the dropped kerbs. Anyone would think the City Council had no resoonsibilies or expertise in road and pavement building. In short the airport is beaten hands down by every airport in every one of the many cities and countries I have used. Mr. Mayor take heed and get your finger out in dealing with this blot on your City's name and reputation.",1
164,"Extremely bad experience - confirms poor web ratings - robbersIn a nutshell:- We had rented a small manual shift car- The guy at the counter asked if we wanted an upgrade to automatic car with built-in GPS and we said yes- At this stage we said yes ok, as coming from France it's comfortable to have an automatic car while driving on the other side of the road- then he sold us a hybrid car - ""will save you gaz""- We said ok (stupid me) and went to the car and issues started- The car was super BIG! (Toyota corolla 1.8l) - Of course the guy didn't tell us ! We were on a hurry and thought, ok, too late to change it- There was and un-noticed hole on the drivers' carpet + the GPS was ""not activated"" in this car + there was a flat tyre !!! Of course we noticed one thing after the other meaning going back and forth to the counter and queuing again- With the flat tyre we gave back the key and said we wanted the original car. The counter guy, let's call him a sales man, gave us a Volswagen Passat! Happily enough, I knew that model and had to ask again for the ORIGINAL SMALL CAR !- Finally gave us the FORD Focus, automatic and with GPS and so still an upgrade - happy with that BUT we lost 1,30min-  he said we didn't have to sign anything and price would be as originally booked- we were finally charged the price of the TOYOTA Corolla !!!- I contacted customer service and they only compensated for the lost time - I still paid for the Corolla which I could never drive !!! Well, I had my hands on the steering wheelI posted a review on Google, Europcar answered to contact customer service - they obviously did not even read my message since I do mention that I contacted customer service. They don't care and don't even read - which probably also means they know about the situation and are not willing to change anything.",1
165,"1. Drop & Go was excellent. The arrival was good, but tech bewildering, so staff helping everyone at the machines. Staff lovely and helpful when I had a problem. Return tech well signed and worked brilliantly.The rest of the review refers to T1:2. Security - great staff but first time at an airport where security hall is little better than an underground carpark. Oppressive and airless. What a terrible place to work in such a high pressured role dealing with thousands of people. Absolute disgrace. But staff helpful despite this.3. Departures. A lengthy circuitous walk through an empty area (no seating) then around very quiet duty free, eventually to arrive in overcrowded departures 'lounge'. At least there was some natural light. Of course not enough seating. There was no meaningful information point or any staff who looked like they could answer a query. Only staff other than retailers were people who happened to be walking through plus those helping with access.4. Arrivals. Long walk along narrow corridors, up and down stairs. Poor environment. No indication of how far to go. Not good. Once 'landside', no signs to Drop & Go.I realise overcrowding is a common problem in airports and ridiculous trek around duty free shops in which I have no interest is also found elsewhere, but the MAN experience was particularly poor. The 3 stars are entirely for the helpfulness of the staff and smoothness of D&G.",3
166,"Don't use this airport unless you really have to, I want to echo the recent post where the reviewer highlights the chaos at the security screening.Having queued for a solid 30 minutes to get to the actual screening staff we then had to wait for what was apparently a second screening, we had to guess this because no staff explained what was happening and I can confirm that this evening at LEAST 50% and more than likely more, of all hand luggage was being redirected and delayed.How can that amount of bags need rechecking!!!Our bags had nothing different from when they passed the initial screening in Dublin airport except for some confectionery gifts, no liquids, no electronic, gels or any other listed prohibited stuff, what is going on at Manchester Airport.Bad enough that the volume of rechecking is so ridiculously high but the mistreatment of the travelers who are keeping the airport busy is unbelievable.Having eventually had my bag held up and the staff announced what colour it was I had it hand checked and was questioned, no problem with the concept of rechecking but for heavens sake what are the scanning machines doing if the volume of rechecking is so high?How can so many bags be held back, are the machines faulty or too sophisticated?My wife was waiting even longer and was eventually asked to confirm ownership of her bag which she did, whereupon the security guy took the bag away AGAIN with absolutely no explanation, a further 20 minutes passed before we managed to get the attention of a supervisor who did his best to find out what was going on.The now MISSING bag was located thanks to the help of an eagle eyed traveler who spotted the bag sitting in a tray outside of the rechecking area, how it got there and why no knew or cared.The queue of people left waiting and wondering what was happening to their hand luggage was shambolic, if this was a third world airport it would still be disastrous.We lost 45 minutes due to that rechecking shambles and there were lots and lots of other people similarly treated with a lack of respect and awareness, not explaining to people why their bag is being delayed is unforgivable.Also the queuing area leading to the screens is a fire hazard waiting for a tragedy, the queuing barriers are permanently fixed and people are corralled like cattle in pens, if a fire was to break out a mass of deaths is almost guaranteed, why can't the removable tape barriers not be used and reduce the risk of stampeding people being trapped in metal pens?",1
167,"Minus 10 stars for Special Assistance at T1On Sunday August 21st, I checked into the Special Assistance Reception with my 93 year old mother-in-law. Whilst the staff there were very friendly, I was very surprised that I was expected to push the wheelchair, handle boarding passes & security without any extra help once our bags had been checked in (by a very friendly, cheerful male employee). Our experience was in complete contrast to our treatment on our outward flight from Cornwall Airport on the 18th.On Sunday, the male member of EasyJet staff at Gate 9, showed absolutely no compassion or empathy towards my mother-in-law when I wheeled her to the gate. No option was given to take the lift down  to the plane. He seemed totally disinterested, merely telling us to leave the chair at the top of the steps. She felt compelled to use the steps, typical of her generation in not wishing to be a burden to others, even though she's had both knees replaced & finds stairs challenging! The other passengers ahead of us in the queue, kindly allowed us to descend the steps ahead of them, even walking at her pace onto the tarmac, until I asked them to overtake us. I was extremely annoyed to see 2 other wheelchair users sitting in their chairs at the bottom of the front steps, accompanied by a member of the Special Assistance team. We had to use the rear steps, which were extremely steep for her to use. As she stepped onto the plane with no assistance from the stewardess, (I was behind her), she almost fell back off the plane due to the lack of a handrail & the height of the step up. She was pretty shaken up & distressed at the lack of compassion shown towards her. Imagine our delight on arrival at Cornwall airport, when the ramp was brought up to the plane & a member of the airport team was waiting for her with a wheelchair. The extremely competent female member of staff demonstrated all the professionalism & empathy that had been so lacking at Manchester. She waited for me to retrieve our bags  & Mum was pushed all the way  out to the car. Manchester Airport you should be ashamed of the shabby & dismissive way you treat people with mobility issues.",1
168,"Travelled home from Singapore on a 14 hour flight with a lot of different nationalities on the flight. It was going on to Houston but everyone needed to get off at Manchester to be checked through security. Sat waiting on the plane for steps to arrive to let us off for 30 minutes after landing. Not great but that’s okay. Around 15 people in high viz at the bottom of the steps being generally rude to passengers. 1 bus there for 250 people, so now you’ve got people waiting on the tarmac for the bus to go back and forth, with the rude staff. Now to the passport check, hardly anyone there so we thought great. Until the demon lady working there began shouting at a family because they had walked through the wrong side (0 signage for this). She then asked another lady if she had kids with her, the lady clearly didn’t speak English so responded ‘Houston’ to which the demon took great offence and began literally screaming at the woman who had just come off a 14 hour flight and was about to get another. I’m all for being kind to the people who turned up but they need to do the same. I then complained politely to the second person in the entire security process and last one i saw and he responded by telling me to take my hat off for my face to be recognised. Thanks Sherlock. On to collect bags, got very lucky by all accounts and both bags collected in about 10 seconds, went to use the loo, gents broken, had to use disabled. Covered in feaces, disgusting, flush broken, nearly threw up. Outside to meet our lift, chaos again. New parking regulations so they can get £25 out of every passenger by being there for more than 6 mins. My father in-law was in the queue to get in for 1 hour 30 mins. Used my nogging and didn’t stand inside the car park full of queues of cars. Walked out to the queue he was still in, pulled over bags in, off ya pop. Saved 2 hours. Place is a joke, big dogs still paying themselves hundreds of thousands a year, rinsing passengers with this new parking swindle too, on top of all the normal stuff. Btw Bali and Singapore airports 0 issues with anything. 5* experience in both. Shame on you Manchester Airport.",1
169,"Had to be the absolute worst airport experience. From the start: taxi driver needed an additional $6 because simply driving into the airport everyone is charged that amount. Can you imagine having to pay $6 to pick up or drop off a family member at an airport? How greedy. Walking in, no signs showing where airlines are. Found the airline and even though we were checked in and had our bags tagged we had to wait in line for over 30 minutes because there was no one working the bag drop lane. Drop out bags and look around for security signs. None. Just some guy rudely pointing people into lines. We get to the front and he tells us to go walk down a hallway to some other security check. So we walk and walk and walk and there are signs saying security A and security B but no signs telling you what each one means. We end up at security B in the legit basement. Huge lines and tsa people yelling, and I mean yelling at everyone. I had to take out all liquids, which is standard, and put them in a bag. What was not normal was I had to put my deodorant in the bag, mascara, hand sanitizer and chap stick in the bag? I wasn’t prepared for this rule since I have never ever in any travels ever had to do that. Finally get to tsa and I have to place my belongings into a bin, take my shoes off even though others kept theirs on (there were no rules for this just if the tsa person said to, how there is no standard is beyond me). I had ballet flats on and no socks, my husband had full sneakers on. I had to stand there in no socks on a disgusting floor while he kept his sneakers on. They separate you from your belongings, you think to yourself how will I find them again since they send your stuff in one direction and then make you walk so far away from them to another body check location and wait in line. You have no idea where you stuff goes bc you can’t keep and eye on it. Makes it so stressful and unsafe. Finally got my belongings and had to put hand sanitizer on my feet bc of how disgusting I felt. Get into the airport and our flight was leaving in 20 mins and the board says “will show gate at 11:24”. Our flight left at 11:30 so we have no idea where we’re supposed to go. Finally it shows the gate and we have 6 minutes to get there. We rush and there is no plane for 30 mins. Get on the plane and wait another 30 mins only to be told “we have to wait longer bc a bag made it onto the plane that hadn’t gone through tsa so it has to go back and be checked then brought back”. How does that happen!? So unsafe. I have never wanted to be away from some airport so much in my life. Rude staff. No signs. Horrible confusing tsa. Dirtyyyyy. Delays. I travel very often and have never seen anything like this place in my life. Will never use again.",1

As it was in the middle of the day we were apprehensive of what difficulties we'd experience.We got to the airport 4 hours before 'check in' just to be on the safe side.No sooner as we got into Departures TUI opened up the Bag Drop. This was an hour earlier than usual. This really did help as we were straight into Security.There was quite a bit of a queue but to be honest there was enough security staff on to keep the queue moving.All in all, from getting out of the taxi and to having our first obligatory holiday pint in the Departure Lounge took 1 hour.It seems opening up the Bag Drop an hour early and having enough Security Staff on really does help.If Manchester Airport, Terminal 2 can keep this up, people's experiences will only get better.Big Thanks.Team Rae...",4
172,"Appalling. Travelled on the 23rd of July to find the baggage system didn't work meaning check in took around 90 minutes. Once through security going, a small highlight, the departure lounge was over crowded, understocked, unclean and lacking a number of expected shops. Flight was delayed from 90 mins initially to nigh on 3 hours due to a lack of cleaning teams to clean the plane, one team for the entire terminal apparently. On return, security took almost an hour, this at 3am, again after another 2 hour delay to find that in this time not a single bag had even passed through to the baggage collection area. Pathetic airport considering the size and amount of flights that leave from here.",1

An airport should work like a well-oiled machine, with all elements working in unison. For examples of airports that respect their passengers and deliver an amazing service from start to finish, take a look at Liverpool, Dublin, Lisbon, Munich, Larnaca … the list is endless.Such a shame as Manchester used to be a great airport to travel through.

Not one sandwich, salad or anything substantial in WH Smith in the chillers. Pret had 1 cheese toastie and 1 Mac n cheese left. With a lactose intolerant family member, we had no choice but to que for 20minutes to get a burger in Holt's.

179,"I travel frequently, once/twice per month. T"" is a joke, how can anyone work or commuicate with no wifi of cellular signal. They say how much they invest, clearly not in the correct areas. Shame on you.",1
180,"Terminal 2, what jokeI was really looking forward to seeing the new terminal 2, but how disappointed I was. It is clear to see how corners were cut in the project, given the poor and unsuitable choices made, patterning the installation of plastic vinyl flooring throughout a Myriad of high traffic areas including toilets. Toilets are entirely unfit for purpose, as the urinals in the men’s toilet area are mostly broken, cheap and very few In numbers. I am confident that many of the project planners would absolutely not accept such a shoddy culminations in their own homes. I have been to many service stations around the U.K.  which are cleaner, have a better finished, and operate more facilities that this so called new and over crowded terminal 2. What shamble.",1
181,"On 29th July we flew from Terminal 3 to Cork at9am. Having checked in online, taking only hand luggage and booking fast track via Ryanair, our journey through the airport was speedy and a pleasant surprise.  However, the experience was marred by the authoritative and domineering attitude of the man accepting bags onto the security scanner. I travel frequently,but have never experienced such rudeness, not only to me, but also to others ahead of me in the line. A bit of power goes to some people's heads!",3
182,"Lack of organisation, dirty, slow, overcrowded and worse of all.. the parking is an absolute joke! Prepaid,. Pick up, drop off.. any option you think about is an absolute rip off! Management Should be embarrassed!",1
183,"I would give 0 Stars but it won’t let me. I dropped 2 family members off in the drop off zone. It took 3 minutes . But when I went to leave I had to pay £5 at a barrier . Absolutely unbelievable. Disgusting. How dare you, that is extortionate. £5 FOR 3 MINUTES  YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED. WORST AIRPORT I’VE EVER BEEN TO.",1
184,"Travelled via terminal 1 and everthing was fine and no big queues apart from security - it was horrendous! Took us 1.5 hours to get through. The queue was monitored Well however and we did experience a few queue jumpers but security did handle them brilliantly and remove them from the queue. It was really hot in the queue, no aircon and nowhere to buy any drinks from etc. Once we actually got to the security hall it was absolutely carnage. People pushing, shoving, staff being rude and unhelpful. There was just no order what so ever, trays were flying all over, peoples bags being tossed about. It really was the most stressful thing. Once through though, there was no more queuing and everything was fine. Manchester really need to sort security out.On arrival back to terminal one, the baggage reclaim was fairly smooth, as, was passport control, no delays etc, however the toilets were filthy and scruffy and really not welcoming at all.",1
185,Still here...this airport is a money making machine that doesn't care about people. Just visit their website for a time wasting experience where the only info they have is how to shop and pay for extortionate parking.,1
186,Travelled through T3 at Manchester Airport UK on 29 Jul 22.  Security staff are so bully.  They have no respect towards passengers at all.  They are so frustrated working bunch.  They should QUIT the job if they are not enjoying it. Nobody can hold them back for this job forcefully.  I suggest people to avoid this airport where possible.  Short tempered security staff will ruin your day and your journey.  Their bad behaviours keeps haunting you many days yet to come.  I really had a worst experience with these security lot.  Have patience and learn to tolerate the people.  They are there not to be get bullied by you bullies.  How do you feel if you are treated the way you treat the wearied people who were in expectation of help and assistance.  Shame on you.,1
187,"Flew out on Thursday morning, yes it was busy, but the T1 staff were all professional. Fast track security was well worth the extra though. Through check in and security in just over an hour.  Ships airport side were all well stocked. Biggest stress was the M62 being closed but can’t blame the airport for that!",4
188,"Would give 0 if there was option. Terminal 3 has a dingy, awful security area. I’ve been to third world countries with better facilities. The one 8x8” liquids bag allowance is ridiculous. I’ve never seen this at other airports. Queues were ridiculous. Most of the staff (though there was one nice sympathetic lady) seemed to enjoy seeing people have to throw away their liquids that wouldn’t fit in the measly bag and kept barking out the rules. Utter jobsworths who would suit working in a prison. No customer care whatsoever. Very miserable start to the holiday. Will avoid in the future if possible.",1
189,Actually had a pleasant experience when travelling for a short stay last weekend.I thought it only best to share my positive experience in a time of mostly negative experiences.,5
190,"Awful. Worst airport we have ever flown from. Never in my life have we experienced such disorganisation, chaos, unhelpful jobsworths and queues longer than a return trip to Germany & back. Shockingly understaffed and those that are there clearly don’t want to be. Will never ever be flying from Manchester T1 ever ever again. Absolutely dismal.",1
191,Got to be one one of the worst airports Europe.,1
192,"Worst experience ever. 6 people travelling ( 2 adults, 1 elderly, 3 children) We were due to fly out on the 24th of July 22 with Corendon airlines to Antalya, flight was due to leave at 14.10 hrs. We got to the airport at 11.10 hrs and had to wait in a queue that came all the way round to security ( checkin desk 70-73, terminal 1). We eventually got to check in but it took approx 1 hour 45 minutes. Then it was on to security that didn’t take as long as I thought it would, approx 45 minutes. Getting through security the information screen showed to relax and wait until 16.00 hrs. At approx 15.45 they put on the screen to go to gate 24. We all headed to gate 24 and waited until 18.00hrs when finally they announced that the flight has been cancelled. Apart from this we had no information whatsoever. The plane was there and then we saw it being moved. Eventually someone came to the door and informed people that the flight has been cancelled due to pilots running out of hours so the flight was leaving as it could not take paying passengers. We continued waiting there and then eventually they informed us that we would have to go through immigration then collect our luggage and head back to the check in desk. This was all done by 20.15 hrs. We were then given food vouchers and told that they would have an answer from corendon with regards to hotel etc or replacement flight in 1 hour. After we returned in 1 hour there was no one there. We then waited and waited until approx 23.00hrs with no further updates. People with young kids were left waiting with no seating. We were all sat on the floor. Finally someone came and told us that it would be best to return to our homes or book into hotels and we would find out in the morning if corendon would be putting on a flight. As you can imagine no flight was put on and we were then informed late on, Tuesday 25th by Corendon that the flight had been cancelled! I think this was despicable behaviour from Manchester Airport  because we are all aware that the reason for our flight not leaving is due to ground staff availability but not once did they admit this. They were more then happy for everyone to hold corendon responsible for this. I personally think Manchester airport should be held responsible for flights being cancelled and not the airlines. Shameful behaviour and I will think twice in the future about using Manchester airport.",1
193,"If I could give 0/5 I would.. Yesterday we were due to fly to Turkey with Corendon airlines. Our flight was delayed for 5 hours and then cancelled. We were told over and over again there would be an update on a replacement flight, overnight accommodation,etc. But in the end noone came to help. we were left stranded and had to arrange our own accommodation in Manchester. The flight WAS there! it took off without us. Corendon blame Manchester airport baggage handling ....ie there were not enough staff to put the bags on the plane. Is that true??? we don't know. But what I do know is that we were left, with two childre , sat in an airport for 10 hours in total, with NO HELP at all from anyone at Manchester.",1
194,The absolute worst airport that I have ever used and I've traveled to various third world countries over 3 decades. Massive queues everywhere both flying out and in. Even the WiFi and phone data connection is rubbish. Which is great when you have to watch a sweet wrapper going round and round the carousel for  more than 2 hours while waiting for the bags to arrive. Use any other airport.,1
195,Best experience we’ve ever had. D&G Parking is so convenient and straightforward. Friendly and helpful staff at every touch point. Speedy and organised process overall. Fastest check in and security we’ve had in a long time and we travelled at the start of the children’s summer holidays. Well done Manchester Airport Terminal 3.,5
196,"Shockingly disorganised in security. Appallingly long, slow and winding queue with  no organisation at all. Unhelpful staff. Never travel through Manchester airport. Stay away!",1
197,I lost my luggage back in June after a holiday flying back from Jamaica. Today I received a call saying it’s been found. I’d like to thank the airport for not giving up. Thanks,5
198,Went on holiday 11th July dropped off by my son at 3:30am at terminal2. Went in got assistance told us where to go and we had no problems straight through security all in under 40mins. Thank you everyone what helped us out. We wasn’t looking forward to what we was going to look forward to but me and my husband couldn’t thank you all enough it was great service.,5
199,I had lost my wallet in t2 which had over 600in cash but thankfully imran who works at the marks and Spencer in t2 picked it up and contacted me so I could get it back. Very nice guy and thank you very much,5
200,My plane landed at 7.31am from Punta Cana and I had to wait till 9.13 for getting my baggage. This unacceptable.,1
201,"Just a horrible place from start to finish to extract maximum money from anyone, anyhow whilst offering a shockingly poor customer experience from start to finish. To say T2 is a new terminal they couldn't have designed it much worse with totally inadequate facilities. Mcr airport ruins the start and end of any trip unfortunately.",1
202,"Going to keep this short as I’m so hacked off and feeling ripped off. I booked fast track for security due to the horror stories, plus lounge access……after all, it’s the first holiday in 3 years so let’s do it in a bit of style.Flight was at 18:20 (well done TUI!) so we arrived as planned at 15:00. Check in was good (well done TUI), but as soon as the responsibility was the airport’s, then things started to unravel. We were told not to go through fast track as it “would make no difference”. Wrong mate, it would have made loads. We walked away 40 minutes later.Went straight to the Escape Lounge and were told that the food would come out at 16:30. Great, that’s a chance to have a drink and relax after the drive. What was actually meant by “the food would come out at 16:30” is that the burnt stodge on the hot plate would be removed…….and not replaced with anything fresh……..because the place shuts at 17:00. To add insult to injury, the bar closed at 16:30 but customers only informed of that after it was locked up. £80 for a sprite, a Prosecco and a whisky…….ouch. Utter and total rip off.",1
203,"Flight was with TUI to Greece I’m mid July 2022, just before the school holidays. Check in was ok with only a small 20 minutes queue. Getting through security was a massive queue and total madness with people loosing items and trays almost thrown onto conveyors for scanning. Once through it was like a mad house, toilets leaking onto the floor and out of service, 20 minutes wait for coffee, no available seats so people sitting on the floor (this was terminal 2 by the way). On return we had a three hour delay in Greece without any explanation and to really cheer us up a wait for almost three hours for our luggage to arrive again without a single apology or reason for the delay. Manchester airport is an absolute disgrace and people are treated worse than animals. I have been lucky enough to travel all over the world and have never experienced anything as poor as this.",2
204,Just dropped my daughter and family off at Manchester airport terminal 2. I was there 4 minutes but was mugged by a machine on the way out which stole £5 from me and then let me go. How is this allowed.,1
205,Dreadful experience - TUI flight 0700 4 July - arrived at T2 at 0415 having checked in on line and dropped off cases day before - Security queues snaking took 2 hours. We were advised at Drop off to make sure we were at Security at least 2 hours before our flight - hence we allowed nearly 3 hours simply to go thru security & get to our Gate.Worst still - return flight landed on time at 1700 - waited at the carousel for 2 hours after clearing Border Control - passengers with tired children - passengers with trains to catch to carry on their journey.No staff on the floor and a few announcements to advise cases will be delayed but will be delivered.There were suitcases from previous flights all over the place waiting to be collected we presume.We would try to avoid flying from this Airport if we could having had a previous experience 3 years ago when it took again over 2 hours to wait for our bags.We were led to believe the problems are caused by Swissport baggage handling.,1
206,"Our flight back from Paphos yesterday was nothing short of a joke. The plane was already delayed due to a crew issue which was not a good start. The plane barely had any food or drinks as apparently it’s only filled once a day in the morning and when it’s gone it’s gone (our flight was at 2pm so god help those that had an evening flight).  After arriving at Manchester we had to sit on the plane for 40 minutes waiting for the ground crew to bring the steps and allow us to officially park up. The security queues were fine however the staff are just plain rude. Everyone had to electronically scan their passports and there we lots of elderly people who were struggling to use the system. Instead of being offered a little patience and assistance, they were totally demoralised in front of other passengers and were told to go into another queue which represented the conga. After arriving into baggage claim it was very clear that the airport had lost control of what was going on. Baggage was being delivered to the wrong carousels, there were no baggage handlers to unload the planes, and unclaimed luggage was strewn all over after people didn’t know where they were collecting their bags from. After waiting an hour and a half we were told our baggage would be another 10 minutes, this clearly wasn’t the case. People who had boarded with hand luggage were advised by Ryan air to check them into the hold which caused these types of passengers and unnecessary delay. They gave the odd announcement that they had staffing issues which they apologised for. Passengers were beginning to complain and become irate as 7 flights had now landed with no one being able to collect baggage and there was no room for anyone to move. A passenger complained after she still don’t have her bags yet flights that landed considerably after hers had now collected there’s. She was clearly told that the planes that were flying back out next were to take priority and that for them to sit there waiting in order of arrival would cost the airport and airline a considerable amount of money and therefore she wasn't a priority! It turns out that our bags had been dumped outside the carousels and had been sat there well over an hour along with another two flights, but they only had two baggage teams working and they needed to unload the planes.Now I appreciate that they were short staffed, and you shouldn’t take it out on staff that have made it into work, but they don’t help themselves. The staff were rude, unhelpful and had a clear lack of customer service skills all round. It doesn’t matter what time of year it is, but out of all the other airports I have ever used, Manchester is always the most chaotic and unorganised.",1
207,"Shocking airport, next to no places open for food/drink. The places that are open takes over an hour queueing.Avoid at all costs!",1
208,Don’t believe what the press say. Had seamless check in and security clearance. Arrived 3 hours before our flight was due to depart. Sufficient time. From entering the airport to getting to the departure lounge took less than an hour. Superb service. No complaints.,5
209,"What a joke it is trying to pick someone up from this dreadful Manchester Airport. Set off once family through passport control and got there 30 mins later. Oh, we are still waiting for our baggage. Parked up on the one hour free bus drop off zone. Then the clown comes around and moves you on. The only reason I’m here is the incompetent Manchester Airport. The muppet then said it’s not Manchester Airport as it’s made up of five segments. We are just the landlord. Your problem is with the baggage handlers. It shows how out of touch this bunch of comedians are, instead of pulling together they blame each other. Horrendous place and organisational. Let’s all stop flying from Manchester and use other airports. They then might realise working as a team and pleasing your customers is the only way forward.",1
210,"If there was the option for no stars i'd use it. Got to airport in advance as advised, good job!! Massive queue outside for easyJet! Got shoved into that queue for a long time, got to the end, got into the building to yet another massive queue the same!!! All this was to queue to get to a self service check in for your case, weigh it put your own label on!! Then go queue again for a desk (out of the huge length of desks only about 3 or 4 open!)  to drop your bag off......then off to Security. We'd actually booked into one of the Lounges but with all this queueing we did not make it! At security we mentioned we'd missed our Lounge booking and were sent through priority!!! But, again although no queues initially they were not fast!! Took too long and eventually after everything we only had 15 mins to get to the gate!!! Absolutely awful and will try very hard NEVER to fly from here again, or definitely not easyJet, I'll review them too!",1
211,"We travelled through Manchester Airport in March and found it pretty bad.  Our return arrival in April was much better.We flew out again to America in June and arrived back on 14th July.  Both Virgin flights were just great.  The staff couldn’t have been nicer or more helpful.  The car parking was fantastic too.So why not 5 stars?  Yes as usual there are a lot of building works going on, but that is no excuse for the toilets being disgustingly filthy.  The area around the main entrance and bus stops are also filthy with lots of things having been spilt and never ever cleaned up in years! Chief Exec of Manchester Airport get your cleaning rotas sorted! If there are staff shortages get out and do it yourself! First impressions matter.",4
212,"Flew out Saturday 9 July. Arrived at airport 12.00 midday, was in departure lounge by 12.40. It was a breeze with Jet 2, minimal queues and no delays at all.Arrived back (30 minutes early) at 00.30 17 July and was in our taxi by 01.15. Again, no queues at all.Thank you, those two visits were faultless!!",5
213,"what can I say !!! it has been one of the worst experiences ever .. this must be the worst airport I have used , Security stuff top it all up , you can tell they are unprofessional , the way they deal with people , most of all the senior stuff , the arrogance shows that these people lack in education , the. way they  look there behaviour !!!!!! the senior security is a bully with high authoritative voice , bullies people of a bottle of medicated foot location , this guy needs some serious training before he can do any Job , airport crowded with no where to sit , high prices dirty toilets and everywhere seemed like a war zone. , very depressing how could have Great (!!!! )  Britain allowed this to happen , this is unacceptable when you are paying high prices for everything . shame on you",1
214,"Manchester airport is a disgrace. We had an early flight and with lovely check in staff we cleared without any problems but couldnt believe our eyes when we went to find something to eat. Queues to food outlets were unbelievable with people waiting almost 30 minutes to be served.. The area resembled a,war zone, it was dimly lit,filthy dirty and people were fed up. We finally got served,  paid over £25.00 for 3 sandwiches and 3 coffees that were only fit for the bin. What a contrast on return journey from Palma airport,bright,clean,welcoming with fresh,reasonably priced food. Arriving back in Manchester it was heartbreaking to arrive at baggage carousel and see peoples suitecases strewn everywhere unclaimed ,again the area was grey ,dirty and full of thouroughly miserable passengers. No staff around to help, it was a ""get on wth it""attitude. For gods sake Manchester sort yourselves out, if your short of staff ask yourselves why and strive to be the kind of place people want to work. The only reason people are using the horrible place is because they dont have a choice. You truly dont deserve peoples custom and people using your service deserve much much better. Honestlyif you can travel from somewhere else then seriously consider it because their total lack of customer care is beyond belief",1
215,"Booked car parking for me and my in-laws. On one of the bookings the website crashes and said payment failed. In the end I got two email confirmation for the two transactions. But when I checked my credit card I had been charged three times. I used their complaint form online and was told they would get back in 10 days in an email. Tried again a month later after no response. Got a new email saying 10 days. Still nothing. Went through my credit card in the end. They were good, put the money back on my card then recharged me three days later!!!! They owe me £112. I have a parking account with them and I can clearly see two orders and two orders only. I have two email confirmations only. They have stolen my money. If I do not get a reply I am going to the ombudsman.",1
216,"Stuck on a TUI plane at 4am in the morning. Long flight from Crete. We are all tired, children fretful, captain very annoyed with the fact 'the airport arnt ready for us to leave the plane' apparently been told a shift change, at 4 in the morning, what a bloody disgrace! I will never fly from Manchester again, until they get their act together!!",1
217,"No WiFi,  I'm sure that's noting to do with a lack of staff , no phone reception again poor infrastructure. 45 min Late takeoff was due to them still having staff shortages all round very poor, even the German captain was taking the micky out of the airport , can't blame him their airports are great",1
218,"Security staff behave like the gestapo, no please no thank you, just hearded like cattle, and yelled at if in wrong queue, (How is the occasional traveller supposed to know where to go straight away?)  Covid is still rising but no regard for this, nose to nose with other travellers.  Young people behind me getting really stressed with the way they were being yelled at.  I haven't travelled by plane since 2018 and I was suffering with my mental health after being made an example of by one of the security people, apparently my clear plastic bag for liquids was too big ( just the bag! - my liquids got put into two smaller bags which my husband had one and I had the other, so we wern't taking more than we were allowed) but instead of having a quiet word he shouted as loud as he could so every other traveller could hear in the queue - I think that is very rude.  I also had a phone charger cable which I put in the security tray and when I retrieved my tray it had gone.  No other member of the public could have got to my tray before I did so it must have gone missing before it went through the scanner and as I was walking through the metal detector.  Totally disgusting way to treat people and I don't relish my next trip as I will have to use this airport again this year unfortunately!!",1
219,Very unorganised. Too many lines leading to nowhere since there aren’t any signs pointing in the right direction. Hardly any staff. Waited  for two hours to get a boarding pass and to get our luggage checked in. Waited an other hour to get our hand luggage cleared. It was very crowded and the staff seemed like they didn’t want to be there.,1
220,an absolute disgrace was charged £5 to leave after dropping my daughter of at terminal 2 i was there less than 3 minutes,1
221,No issues at security although the security guy at beginning had no patience with people even without a que to deal with. T2 has great shops but omg the terminal is disgusting. Rubbish everywhere. Toilets at gate 208 all broken and flooded. Stairs down to ramp just full of rubbish. All in all don’t just blame the airline for all the issue. The airport has many to address itself !!,2
222,"Rasist, arresting people with no right ,treating you like you're not even a humanOffending you about your sexuality even Boarding forces are trash there !!!!Don't even listen just arresting you because you are white not Muslim!!!!!!!! Having enough details to tell if you are actual criminal or not but still keeping innocent people there and threatening.  Absolute disgrace !!!!!!!",1
223,T1 security Got fast track prior to arrival Checked in at 10am sat in lounge at 10:20Unbelievably quick great service at t1 security Cheers guys good job,5
224,Issue with being charged twice at T3 drop off. Used the contact form on the  web site. Contacted by Frank and all sorted within 1 working day. Great customer service.,5
225,"Writing this review everywhere possible as Kaleel from ABM Manchester Airport was absolutely fantastic. He was left to deal with three wheelchair users (myself included) and an additional elderly couple requiring a wheelchair who hadn’t booked assistance, completely on his own and he took the whole thing completely in his stride. He was beyond professional, kind and friendly, and made coming back to Manchester an absolute dream. He managed to transport two wheelchair users at a time, whilst never forgetting to leave anybody behind, and made sure everyone got their luggage as quickly as possible. He is a shining star and true asset to Manchester Airport & the ABM team and I do hope we see him again when we return in December.",5
226,"Most awful experience- stood queuing for 3 hours and then had to run through the terminal building to catch flight. Security staff are abysmal, terrible attitude, rude and just plain difficult. Tried to tell them our flight was leaving in 10 minutes and was met with arrogance and unhelpful responses. This was T1, should not be operating as clearly in chaos",1
227,Still the worst airport in the world.Staff like commando camp guards Queues as far as the eye can see.Management probably tucked up in bed robbing their living.Filthy dump of a place.Hate everything about it.,1
228,Queues as far as the eye can see…… I can’t count the number of times I’ve called this the worst airport in the world but today it actually plummeted to even greater depths of incompetence and service…. how the management of this airport can justify their extortionate salaries is beyond me…. they and the airport is a national disgrace!,1
229,"I have to say I had no trouble passing through yesterday. Staff were stressed no doubt but they managed well and we had no delays or long queues. Security can be a bit of a pain with some pedantic rules, like one see through bag per person, but this is not down to the airport. Well done for getting us through quickly and efficiently",4
230,Recently arrived on EY 15 on  the 4/07/2022 around 07.40 then the long trek from arrival gate to immigration which went smoothly then the fun started everybody chasing trolleys when 3 long haul flights came in at once luggage took nearly an hour to come off then a dash to the train station the only lift to the walkway was at the far end of terminal 2Arrived at the walkway to find all the travelators switched off again just like when we departed must the airport saving money. Just managed to catch our train at 09.45,2
231,"British Airlines bag drop off was late in opening. Security check in was slow and inefficient.Flight delayed. Facilities poor, unable to purchase food due to long queues and a poor number of seating available in the area. Ladies toilets were poor due to queues and cubicles were dirty or out of order",2
232,"Like so many others, our recent experience of Manchester airport was appalling and if I could give less than one star I would! Numerous unnecessary and pointless queues from the outset. Unhelpful, impolite and officious staff with bulling personalities (ex prison guards?) and voices like foghorns (ex military?)...one particularly offensive woman screamed 'keep in line' right in my mums ear as someone next to her didn't shuffle forward in the queue quick enough and they wanted even more people to be squeezed into the multiple lined queue for security...lovely at 5am in the morning! Dirty, scruffy, unhygienic and poorly maintained airport where you get herded around like brainless cattle. If you pre-booked assistance for your elderly partially paralysed father, like I did, be prepared to get a substandard unhelpful service with broken lifts and long queues with prams to get through security, thank goodness we had a wheel chair! Thessaloniki airport, by comparison, was like a breath of fresh air...queue free, assistance, staff helpfulness (we felt like humans again!) and general organisation were 5+ stars.  Manchester would do well to take some pointers from other airports...what must our visitors think when their first experience of the UK is from this awful airport. Our first flights since lock down and dad's stroke....never again! Like others, my advice is to fly from East Mids, Liverpool, Birmingham...in fact mostly any other airport other than Manchester to avoid receiving such substandard treatment.",1
233,Probably the worst airport experience I have ever had! Faced absolutely disgusting attitude from a female employee on security check upon going to my gate who literary started shouting at me in front of other passengers. I don’t understand how In such polite country you are keeping horrible staff who doesn’t know how to behave and communicate with other people. I hope finally measures will be taken and passengers will be heard.Don’t forget that you represent your country while working in the airport.,1
234,Fantastic experience today going through T2. Check in was about 20 mins. Fast track security took about mins. Great experience. Staff really nice,5
235,"Many hours of delays, queues thousands of passengers with no management in sight. Filthy, smelly and mismanaged. So many piles of lost luggage surely a security risk. Horrific experience.",1
236,After the trek throght security find airside rammed.no seats and an hours queue to get into a bar with 45 mins wait for a drink so 1 hour 45 in total. Do Manchester Airport think people go for a day out?,1
237,"Flew from terminal 1, end of June. We had absolutely no problems, security was busy but we had no delays, staff were friendly and be helpful.",5
238,"When I first looked on line at my flight early in the morning of the 1st July, it already said the flight was delayed by 52 minutes, that was over 12 hours before the flight was due to leave. On arrival at the airport (Manchester)it was like a disaster zone, I had to queue to get through security for over 3 HOURS, we were treated like cattle, an absolute disgrace, I will never fly easyJet or from Manchester airport ever again.Once I eventually got through security I went for a drink. This was around 1830hrs, knowing that the flight was still delayed nearly an hour to 2002hrs, so I had time. I glanced at one of the flight information boards just after finding a table and it said go to gate 7. I ran all the way to gate 7 only to find dozens of other people already there who did the same thing as me. There was nobody from easyJet anywhere around. We all waited patiently, watching hundreds of people all around us boarding the many easyJet flights that were going elsewhere. Tensions were rising and then eventually about an hour and a half later somebody from easyJet came to answer questions, but had no answers, he didn't know what was going on either, then someone else told us that the reason the flight was delayed was that somebody on the plane that was supposed to take us to Aberdeen had fell down the steps disembarking the previous flight and injured themselves, the cabin crew had got blood on them so had to get changed so could not staff the plane going to Aberdeen so they had to find another crew, what a load of rubbish, EasyJet knew almost 14 hours before that the flight was delayed by nearly an hour because it showed up on their own graphic on line, on the Flight Radar website and on Manchester Airports website.The easyJet staff continued to lie to us all telling us the flight is delayed over and over, but could not tell us for how long. Then came the news by text we all really knew; the flight was cancelled. Nobody at EasyJet stood in front of us told us, we had to get it from a text.Tensions boiled over. A man who was also on the flight told everybody this was the second time in 2 days this had happened. He was supposed to be on the same flight the day before, however it was delayed several times being told by EasyJet staff it was just delayed, eventually ending being told it was cancelled around 10pm, exactly the same as happened to this flight. He was understandably furious. We all then could not get out of the airport due to the 'airport rules' as we were on the airside, to go home or find somewhere to stay and were ferried downstairs at the other end of Terminal 1 at Gate 20 where they told us a bus would come to take us to the arrivals hall to be let out. The information given to us all was useless, people were only going to gate 20 in dribs and drabs because nobody told us to go there at first, so we had to wait over another hour for this to happen. We eventually got out of the airport around 10pm after a thoroughly disgraceful experience of Manchester Airport and EasyJet and it's useless, untruthful staff. What was supposed to be my first short enjoyable trip up North after Covid turned out to be my worst nightmare, I will never ever fly EasyJet ever again and will look to other airports before I ever set foot in Manchester Airport again, I have little words for them all except shocking, disgraceful, liars, no empathy, rude, no compassion, lack of basic understanding of paying customers.Why can the airline not keep its paying passengers up dated with the latest information on the flight instead of passengers having to trawl the internet to find it out from flight websites. No information was given to us at any time in the airport by any one at EasyJet or the airport staff, and when it was it was only lies and delaying tactics.",1
239,"I often fly around the world as part of my job, I'm recently back from Taiwan, flying through the airports of Instanbul, Frankfurt, Schipol and Taipai. Manchester Airport is closer to Douala Airport in Cameroon by comparison. Dirty, old fashioned, understaffed and overpriced. Infrastructure is at least 10 years behind comparable airports, staff are rude, with security staff bellowing instructions at you in the security line like the first day of military camp. The terminal is dirty, with graffiti in the toilets, rubbish everywhere, poor or no seating and few and very expensive cafe's. There is nothing glamorous about travelling from this airport, it has neither the staff or the infrastructure to accommodate the passengers in any acceptable way, it's nothing but misery, from start to finish. Avoid like the plague.",1
240,A disgrace......i will write more once I've calmed down,1
241,"How to start a holiday.Firstly find a different airport to fly from other than Manchester. No organisation, staff unsure of what to do, rude and bad mannered and the lack of communication is astounding.",1
242,"Well. Where to start with this place. At the very outset, things seemed promising. After an uneventful journey to the airport, my entirely unnecessary 60-90 minute contingency I’d build in essentially put me right at the front of the queue for check in, which I sailed through in about five minutes. This, however, is where the wheels fell off. Presumably because my bag isn’t made out of Vibranium, I wasn’t able to check it in at the check-in desk, instead being sent to “G13” for “soft and oversized” bags. I might as well have been a sent to Narnia. G13 is to the check-in desk, as the Falklands are to the UK. Bloody miles away, and completely forgotten about. After eventually checking in my unsuitably soft bag, I made my way through to security. This wasn’t too bad. Just your common or garden worker bees who looked like they’d rather be anywhere else on earth than Manchester Airport, but that’s fairly standard for airport staff nowadays, so I can let that slide. I was told off for putting my wallet in the plastic tray, so I put it in my bag, was told off again, so put it back in the plastic tray and was allowed through the metal detector, without any issues. Success.Onwards to departures. Surely this was it. I’m home and dry. No. I wandered through Duty Free looking for the bars/ restaurants in order to avail myself of that sweet first pint of the holiday. Manchester Airport is a major international airport, right? They’ll have adequate hospitality, right? Guess what. Wrong. Now, I’m flying with TUI, which means I’m at T2. T2 has four… FOUR bars/ restaurants. Four. One of which, Amber, which is quite a nice looking bar, stops letting people in for a drink at… 11pm? No. 9pm? No. 7pm?? Still no. They stop letting people in at 2:30pm, which functionally, is useless. Your only options, therefore, to squeeze EVERY single traveller who wants a drink or some food into either Wagamama’s, San Carlo, or The Bridgewater Exchange. The queue for Wagas stretched all the way back to G13, so that was out. Bridgewater was huge as well, so the only option was San Carlo, where the queue seemed hearteningly short. Or so I thought. What I joined was essentially a pre-queue. A queue that you had to join, in order to be let into the queue for the restaurant. I served my sentence in the pre-queue before being eligible to apply to join the queue for the restaurant. As I got nearer to the front, I was expecting to see a busy busy restaurant full of people, staff zipping around ferrying food and drinks back and forth, but what I actually saw was a 50% empty Zizzi knockoff, with more members of staff than customers, all of whom looked like they were taking part in a competition to find the least credible way of looking busy to avoid actually doing anything. I watched what I can only assume was a manager or supervisor walk over to the service area where 6 plates were waiting to be bussed out, re-arrange the order of the plates and walk off empty handed for another stroll around the restaurant. I watched another girl clean the same table three times, while two other member of staff just wandered off and out of the restaurant altogether, returning some 10 minutes later.I was finally shown to a table, where I ordered some food. Not the food I actually wanted, that wasn’t available, but the best of the rest and what I now felt was a hard earned beer. Rather than it being the first sip of my holiday, this was relief after the ordeal of the airport so far. Sitting next to helpful departures screen on the wall, I cast my eye up to find my flight. An hour… no, wait… now two hours delayed. Of course.",1
243,"Landed from Madrid Saturday 25th June just after 11 on ryanair 3186? - my husband needed assistance from the plane, we were welcomed immediately the doors opened by Gary (nickname will or bill i think), he was so lovely and chatty,  pushed hubby to t3 car park where he waited with us a few mins to taxi arrived then helped my husband,  this guy is a credit to the already fantastic assistance team and i hope he gets recognised for this review.  hope we get him again in 2 weeks when we go to Majorca.  thanks Gary",5

245,"The airport seemed virtually empty yet we almost missed our flight after spending about an hour getting through security.  I'm guessing the people working in security were former night club bouncers based on their customer service style.  They were so inefficient, and so understaffed, but the rules they were enforcing were bizarrely the strictest I've seen at any airport, so almost every bag was getting searched due to items that every other airport ignores (eg a phone charger or a small nasal spray).  The queue moved glacially slowly, and the staff clearly don't like their jobs, throwing out little gems like ""Well you should have listened"" and ""It's like banging my head on a wall"".  Impressively dysfunctional.",1

247,"Manchester airport is an embarrassment and a disgrace.  Flew to Menorca 21 June 2022, with my husband and his disabled, elderly Mum.My husband agreed that he would push her to the gate but would need assistance to board the aircraft.    Jet 2 staff told us that we would have to wait until the assistance person arrived.  We waiting a considerable time the plane was fully boarded apart from us.  We were asked if she could walk down two flights of stairs as there was no help and the lift was broken.  My mum in law had no option but to struggle and was in a good deal of pain.  The assistance had been booked months in advance, so this was very poor. Coming home the assistance at the Spanish airport was trouble free, speedy and efficient.  What a difference when we got back to chaotic Manchester, it is a complete embarrassment.  No special assistance available again, this time there were several people who were really struggling.  The plane was doing a quick turnaround and the next crew were waiting to board before we had left the plane.  We all had to leave without the assistance.When you get to the baggage claim, you are met with utter chaos, no trolleys, baggage left all over the place, which looked like it had been stashed for a while.  Such a scruffy and unorganised impression for first time visitors to our country along with a very unacceptable standard for everyone.  Finally arrived at the car park only to find that the lift was not working!!!!  I agree with other comments I have read on here, about long queues, extortionate prices and poor seating.  Pick up and drop off charges are a total rip off, my husband took a wrong turning and inadvertently drove through the drop off zone, didn't even stop as he realised his error but had to pay £5.00.Such a stressful experience all told and we will never start our hard-earned holiday at Manchester airport in the foreseeable future.  My advice to anyone would be to avoid Manchester airport, travel a little further and have a stress-free start to your holiday.",1
248,"Travelled to Tenerife from Manchester. What a shambles of an airport. We required 2 wheelchairs for 2 members of our party.There were wheelchairs but no assistance staff what so ever to help.We had to push them ourselves even down the airbridge to the aircraft door.Was even worse on our return, we were split up from the 2 of our party requiring assistance only 1 wheelchair available that was half broken and the other disabled person had to walk in extreme pain from a distant gate to the passport control and baggage hall where we met up.I never thought that in 2022 in good old GB disabled people would be segregated and treated like 2nd class citizens.Shame on you Manchester Airport get your act together or turn the lights off and lock the door.As a multi generational family of 5 we will never fly from here again ( we fly at least 3 times per year) and will discourage all we know from this airport. disgraceful treatment",1

The entire experience is based on money extraction, led by some investment outfit took over part ownership with the council. Shame, when they had it it was much better. Hideous spaces, shambolic signage, appalling rip-off drop off charges. Chronically understaffed the list goes on! To those involved, you should be ashamed of yourselves! In a word, crap!",1
253,"Got through check in and security no problem but once you get to the departure lounge and wanted a coffee there are massive long queues everywhere, at every restaurant or coffee shop long queues. No staff at those outlets for the amount of people traveling. Also seats weren't enough.

Manchester airport needs to do better if they want to attract passenger travelling from Manchester airport!!!!!",1

All electric walk ways between terminals as well as elevators broken. When we got to the gate it was like being in an arena at a concert, no one knew where one gate started and another ended. Utter chaos. Terribly disappointing when you're on your holiday you've been excited for literally years. Seemed to be no staff anywhere. Will try Liverpool next time.",1

260,"Followed the news for weeks leading up to using the airport and expected the worst. Many comments on here about staff, waiting times, cleanliness etc. Yes the place is short staffed, however this is not the fault of the staff that are there trying to provide customer service. Although somewhat chaotic, there is some semblance of organisation and staff doing their best to assist. A main cause of delay is the self bag drop/tagging system. Clearly it's essential this is done properly and most people need to read the instructions carefully. Considering there were hundreds in the queue, this obviously takes time.",2

Told to go to the gate then had to stand in a hot stuffy overcrowded room whilst the plane was being cleaned. Then boarded but had missed our slot. Inward bound the plane left Manchester 3 hours late, but time was made up, enough staff at Kefalonia presumably. Back in Manchester waited 2 hours for baggage, later flights bags came first with no explanation or apology. Will fly from Liverpool in future and I hope others will avoid this place. Ashamed that this is the service offered to travellers from other countries.",1

Once through that our flight already boarding yet another 5 lines of snaking passengers before reaching security proper. We had to see a staff member as it was clear we would not get through security in time. After being taken from the line security is another chaotic scene passengers fighting feir place in the line. No work flow, no organisation. Then 20 minutes lost as security wished to scan a 75% empty tube of toothpaste and anusol. I mean come on. EMA don't get that anal and are part of the same moribund group. (Did you see what I did there).  Then a huge walk at double quick pace to reach boarding with seconds to spare.

Even that is and performs better than Manchester.We booked a wheelchair.  We waited.  And waited.  But no wheelchair ever arrived.  There were no lanyards either.  The fine young lady at the place wrote 'LANYARD' on the back of a card but the person in charge of the security could not let us fast track because - wait for it - my partner was not in a wheelchair.  It was awful, oppressive and certainly not user friendly. Then to our plane.  Gate 6 Terminal 1.  No lounge, just a few scrappy seats for some in a corridor.  Fortunately  our plane was not too late arriving after schedule.What a terrible day.  Manchester Airport is a third rate third world excuse masquerading as a modern international airport.Give it a big miss.  There are much better airports the North.",1
271,"I can sum up the security staff in 4 words.  Unhelpful. Rude. Obnoxious. Unprofessional. Not only that but they lack training in customer care and relations. Wearing a uniform is no excuse for having an attitude which, if it carries on, will lead to confrontations. I don't expect manchester airport to take on board what I have said because they will give out the same old speil of how many millions of passengers pass through the airport and only a few complain.

275,"Can I give zero? Long on flash and  VERY short on substance. Worst ever experience both times we went through there. First trip it was the ground crews being understaffed, so all the things we take for granted — luggage on and off, steps brought to the plane, bathrooms cleaned etc were either delayed or canceled. Restaurants ran out of food and closed and other food stores were cleaned out. One flight to Cyprus was diverted to Prague to empty the toilets. Second trip it was the security lines, only two lanes open and huge lines. Had to pull us out so we didn’t miss our flight. I’d suggest instead of all those flashy stores give your passengers a solid efficient experience so they can catch a plane on time.",1

This place is shambolic and management do not appear to be doing anything to sort out the problems and in fact are probably profiteering more than ever as they are not paying any staff to do the jobs! I paid nearly £80 for a lounge I did not have a hope in hell of using but that was not made clear at the time of booking. This airport should be avoided at all costs and maybe only then something will be done to improve it.",1

305,I arrived at Manchester Airport on the 31/5/22 it was the busiest I have ever seen it. However they had lots a lots of staff working very hard. I have never got through bag drop off and security so quickly. Well done to all the staff at the airport 👏,5
306,"This place is an absolute farce. Understaffed and under resourced. An absolute shambles. How arrogant and short sighted can someone be by expecting staff to work in appalling conditions and for minimum wage then wonder why they are short staffed. As an MD this person should have known that there was a busy period coming up but has sat on his hands, and his money and has done NOTHING to elevate the problem.  Fortunately we managed to get to where we wanted but god knows how many people have had their plans RUINED by the place. This place is a dump and they treat customers like they are dirt.",1
307,"I was at the Manchester airport yesterday, I needed to wrap up 9 large boxes. The lady in terminal 1 wrapping shop was fantastic as well as the security and the Wizzair staff? I thought I'd miss the flight but they all made sure all ran smoothly and I made it. Fantastic . Also the parking marshal I met whilst waiting for the boxes, so helpful,not just helping me but I watched how he went out of his way to help others. Without these people I think I would of had a heart attack I was so stressed🙈😂 🤗",5
308,"Special Assistance.A management problem? The two members of staff who did the actual wheelchair pushing are to be commended - working hard and underpaid at £10 an hour - but there was nothing special about the assistance apart from them.I was left for 3 hours in an almost bare room with no food, drink or access to a toilet, then rushed through check in and security because I’d been left too long, then dumped at a gate, with my back to the room, again, no access to food or drink or a toilet for a delayed flight. Told that if I couldn’t manage the aircraft steps ‘the flight will be further delayed because we don’t know when we’ll be able to get the lift’.No sandwiches available on my flight so I’d had had a cup of coffee in 13 hours by the time I arrived at my destination. There is no chance to shop in duty free, buy a snack or sandwich, enjoy some time in a bar.Just dumped.Meanwhile in the special assistance room (not a lounge)  we’re two families of six people all laughing about using the service to get through security quickly. Meanwhile one elderly lady, limping and clearly struggling left to cope alone so as not to ‘bother the staff’ I’m grateful for the help I do get. Very grateful. However, I hate that I now have to ask for help - but this experience has left me upset and in despair about future travelling alone.",2
309,Don’t pay for fast track.  Total con they take your money with no service available.  Paid for this twice now.  Total waste of money.  Staff are rude.  Catering areas are filthy dirty.,1
310,Drop & Go Car Parking.All fine going out but on returning our keys weren’t in the drop box and we had to contact reception via the phone. To be told they were short staffed and hadn’t managed to bring my car !Not what you want to hear at 01:00 in the morning. We then had to wait for 30 minutes whilst they went to find my car & bring it.,1
311,"Disgusting place , the worse airport !",1
312,Definitely the worst airport we have ever been in. Absolute nightmare there.  1 restaurant open and queue of at least 30 people at any one time.  3 queues for 3 different flights all mixed up as there was no clear queue area. Never again.,1
313,"I am travelling with Singapore airlines they are amazing from the minute you book till you arrive, my feedback is for Manchester airport wheel chair service… I can’t fault it, absolutely amazing nothing was too much trouble…. Thank you made my journey more bearable",5
314,Absolute shambles from top to bottom worst airport I have traveled to and from The pickup and drop off is a disgrace with no proper signage and expensive. Also when you get through the gate for your flight we have had to queue on the stairs on more than one occasion which is a safety issue. Avoid it if you can.,1
315,"This is an airport that does not have service as its heart. It will deprive you of time and money and make you feel like it is your fault. The staff seem stressed and put upon from above, so should not be held to blame. The criticism should be placed at the door of the management past. Hopefully, the new crowd learn from past mistakes. Instead of holding my breath i have taken my business to other local airports such as the well run Liverpool.",1
316,"Another awful day at Manchester airport. And we will get home at 3am, if we get home at all. Monumental incompetence and heads must roll across the entire management team.",1
317,"Tale of 2 flights , outbound 23 May absolutely no issues . Arrived to large queue but went through TUI check in very very quickly . Through security no  issues ,on to flight and take off bang on time to Madeira . From here it goes down hill .  2 mountain bikes never put on flight causing complications for our holiday . Rent bikes at our expense and miss 2 days biking . Not end of world stuff . Bikes arrived 4 days later  .     Return flight , picked up at designated time even though they already new there was a four hour delay  . Flight took of and everyone already knew Hell was waiting at Manchester ( which on reflection was a good thing , fore warned etc etc )nearly 4 hours waiting for bags . An elderly couple who had booked assistance left on plane , crew left , cleaners came and went and it wasn’t until the new crew flying to Turkey found them just sitting there . They were given wheel chairs and left to make their own way with just an elderly friend pushing both chairs . Helped them in baggage reclaim as Airport assistance had clearly washed their hands of them .     Compared to their treatment our concerns are minor . I still can’t get my head around that elderly customers with mobility issues could be so shockingly mistreated     The flight was TOM2103 from Madeira  30 May 2022 ( whilst at Madeira you could see the staff going out of their was to assist these people).    TUI and Manchester airport should be appalled at the abject failure to these customers .       I will never use either again",2
318,"Been to Manchester airport many times. It‘s always been a disgrace for insane security procedures but lately it‘s become sheer unfeasible. Fast track lane is not faster than normal track. My six year old child has been hassled by the security and patted down and screened excessively at our last two flights. They are obsessed with americanised procedures.Some of the staff is very rude and are taking their time. Security staff are cocky and will stand around chatting to each other while people are missing their flights because the queue has been static for ages.Currently we are in frankfurt where we had to spend the night because we missed our connecting flight due to a delay that was caused by manchester airport.The wifi in the building does not work although they want to check your covid certificates, which obviously then won‘t load. The building itself is medieval and dirty. This airport can easily be called worst airport in the UK. Avoid at all cost - especially with children! Deserves ZERO stars.",1
319,"Despite the staff shortages, I get that, this airport has never really been a nice place to stay. Unfriendly staff, dirty toilets, bad and uninviting rest areas and bars.",1
320,"Travelled mid-May 2020 through Terminal 2, arriving at the airport at 9:00am for a 13:00 departure.No overcrowding apparent. The entire process was straightforward from the drop and go car parking, to bag drop, to passing through security.My only criticism is that upon reaching Security the attitude of the lady manning the belt was appalling. The scanning station was just being brought in to use when I was called forward, and the lady manning it was immediately hostile and rude. I actually (diplomatically) called her out on it and although no apology was given she did start to make excuses based on what customers on my side of the belt 'usually do' that result in her behaviour. So essentially I was being yelled at for the sins of others by the sound of things. I suspect Security staff have come in for so much criticism in recent weeks that 'bad tempered' is now their default setting. Which is a shame, because the airport and process generally appeared to be running smoothly and was spoiled only by her negative and combative attitude!",3
321,"Terminal 3 is absolutely pis$ poor, to many people crammed in one small area with absolutely f@ck all to do.One bar/restaurant with a massive line, shiť hole",1
322,That what is happening there is not professional! They losing people's REGISTERED BAGGAGES. Big ques and delays!,1
323,"Drop offs and arrivals are just shocking.Terminal 1 pick up is a shambles, it cost more to pick up then to drop off. Which makes people pick up passengers in various different places, to void being charged more then other places or not at all (because it too much money to pick up someone). The pick up points are in a multi story car park that causes absolute carnage, there is no structure to it. Its every man for him self.All parking and drop off need to be the same price. And £5-£6/7 is absolutely ridiculous. Why so expensive. Even if your making improvements. But those improvements are not working.",1
324,This is by far the worst experience I've ever encountered at an airport. The airport is simply not fit for purpose. 4 hour long ques to check bags in. Departure lounge 0 seating due to volume of people. People sitting where ever they simply could. Floors outside toilets outside smoking area simply anywhere they was a space for a bum. Every restaurant closed at 2 bar 1 with a 2 hour que time jst to be seated. The list is ends. It's a health and safety hazard. My concerd are that factual I wad also live on several manchester news raido stations.,1
325,Im sat in Terminal 3 waiting to pick up my girlfriend who is waiting for her luggage. She landed at 2010 to discover that no-one from the airport was ready to receive the plane. After 20 mins on the plane she has since been waiting for her luggage. Apparently a woman from another flight has been waiting 2 hours for hers. This is particularly annoying because my girlfriend only brought hand luggage and was asked by Ryan Air to check it in. My girlfriend is Norwegian and used to Scandinavian efficiency and I am embarrassed on behalf of my country. What a shambles!I use this airport a lot and my experiences range from OK to (recently) long queues and appalling service. It is now 2123 and she is still waiting. Something really needs to be done!,1
326,"Shockingly bad airport.  So disorganised and virtually no staff about to offer assistance.  Security….  The attitude from one guy could only be described as passive aggressive.  Asked him a question as he told me something far too quickly-  he proceeded to say the same thing even faster while rolling his eyes.  It they want to reduce queues, they need to look at the staff.  Then while waiting 45 mins for a cup of tea, the person serving was blaming customers for the delays saying they turned up more than two hours early- Ryan air advised customers to turn up at-least three hours prior to departure.  Again, they need to look at their own staff before they blame customers.  First time is 21 years I have been to that airport and hopefully I will never return.  Who ever runs the airport needs to do what Boris should be doing and leave ASAP.",1
327,"Terrible T3. Huge queues everywhere, dirty and cramped. Is this really Manchester in 2022?. Avoid at all costs.",1
328,"A dark, dismal place were staff look unclean and unkempt. Incredibly ugly inside and out. The shopping and eating parts are miserable with very little natural light. I’ve been three times this year. The last to drop someone off. I was charged £5 for the privilege. An absolute disgrace. Knock down this 1960s Russian municipal building. Bob to Amsterdam or Zurich and see how it should be done.",1
329,"Just flew in to Manchester this morning at terminal 2,what a night mare thrown on plane on way home because of delay,when arrived at Manchester all 3 of our cases had gone missing, nobody in airport at all there to help,or care,we have nothing to wear now family in tears, tried ringing every where nobody cares our can't get threw for hours",1
330,"What a joke. From huge check in queues to massive delays, the airport is a complete state. On our return flight we had delays and when we finally boarded, we were advised that Manchester had not loaded any food or drink so there would be non available. We then finally landed to be told we will would be waiting for some time for steps and a bus.Disembarked and ready for home we then joined the back of a 100-200 meter long serpentine line from hell for security.",1
331,"The Manchester Airport is not fit for purpose and  people should not use this airport at all. Absolutely rubbish! Staff do not know what to do, confused, not trained. Too long queues everywhere. luggages are taking more than 3 hours to release even during the off peak hours.I don't know what CEO, Charlie Cornish is doing? No improvements at all. Please look at the reviews. People should avoid this airport at all cost. The management team of this airport is absolutely inactive, lazy, and incompetent in running an airport. Some third world countries airports are much better run than this airport. I can't believe this is happening here in UK and in a big city like Manchester. Shame on  the company, shame on Manchester city council, shame on Charlie Cornish. You should all resign. Daft baggers...",1
332,Complete and total lack of clarity and organization. Information is not provided properly. There are queues everywhere but people do not know where they start. The staff is not attentive enough to provide instructions at all. In general this airport is difficult to navigate.It is packed and there are not enough seats for all passengers.In general it is very dirty and unkept.It’d be nice if management seemed to care but they probably still make money and don’t care.,1
333,Terminal 3 at Manchester Airport is not fit for purpose and is not an airport terminal for the 21st century. With hardly any natural light and limited food outlets it is an oppressive place to have to spend 3 hours in before my flight departs. I imagine with the right architecture a lot more natural light could be brought into the building and restructuring the layout would provide space for many more food opportunities. I will avoid flying from here in future if I can.,1
334,"Very slow and ridiculous queue waiting for the luggage more than 2 hrs, unfortunately very frequent scenarios in terminal 1 now",1
335,"1 hour and 20 minutes to wait for luggage.4 flights landing after us had all passengers and luggage sorted well before ours appeared.The one member of staff found, sat in a corner office, stated - nothing to do with her - its Servisair.We try contacting Servisair and the telephone blocks incoming calls. Great customer service. No one bothered in Manchester airport to assist.Saw another example whilst waiting, a gent in a disability scooter, aided by 2 staff from the arrivals to the baggage collection. Once baggage collected, the lady with the gent left to their own devices to take all their luggage through customs and onward.Manchester city council you need to get this site onto a meeting agenda. Plan some action and monitor any improvement, because its current operation is a disgrace.Will certainly look at other airports for future travel.",2
336,"Avoid at all costs. Crammed areas at bag drop, security and duty free. Not enough facilities. All restaurants full, crowded and cramped. Had to get a sandwich in wh smith for breakfast.  Nothing worth buying in duty free.  Another reviewer describes this airport as a sh!t show. I agree wholeheartedly.",1
337,"After travelling from Venice with my mum who is deaf and her partner who is in a wheelchair the care we got in Venice was second to none. When we landed In Manchester I asked for a wheelchair and was told we would have to wait 2 hrs for someone to fetch one so my poor mums partner had to hobble a 15 min walk to the carousel, also there were no lifts only stairs. On arrival at the baggage area we waited over 2 hrs for our bags, the airport is dirty in places and they are massively short staffed, I will never fly from Manchester airport again. Rant over",1
338,Didn't have any trouble getting through security etc but once we were through...wow. The departure lounge was filthy! Tables not cleared or cleaned and food all over the floor. Heaven knows what foreign travellers think.,3
339,"The organisational skills of this place are absolutely appalling. Waited at gates for ages and a member of staff didn’t turn up. Furthermore, the security is just daft. I had a crumpled up piece of receipt in my pocket (that they gave me) and the alarm went of and they had to do a full pat down on me. To add to this the bags that they send through the scanner are then hand picked through which takes ages considering the one person manning all of it.",1
340,This airport needs new management now !Summer comes every year these clowns don't seem to know this and to add misery on misery all.the overpriced food and drink outlets are heaving too.My advice is go in ur car to a regional airport and avoid this place of daylight robbery.,1
341,"If I could give it a minus, I would.There is no bag drop, so even if you check in online, prepare yourself for an hour + just to check in your baggage. Security was quick this time.However. When you arrive at T2 at 7pm, RUN to WHSmith and get some sandwiches as they will run out. There are restaurant on the second floor  but as the big one can't be arsed to open, people have nowhere to go. Most of the shops will be closed.",1
342,"My experience this morning in the new Terminal 2 has been appalling. Never experienced queuing practically from the car park to go through security. Minimal staff around to help, advise and guide the throngs of passengers. This is very much an abnormal experience amongst International Airports which has been going on for far too long.",1
343,"I was a little hesitant when flying from T2 to Lanzarote on the 18th May 2022 due to the recent delays reported. My experience was exactly the opposite. We arrived at the multi storey west car park at 6.35am, parked the car (pre-booked), checked our bags in, cleared security and by 7.35am we were enjoying a coffee at Costa, airside!!Excellent service from all staff!!",5
344,"Landed late and found ourselves at furthest point from customs possible.  No one to help my 80 year old mother so she was very tired when we got there. I asked someone to help her at auto passport check but instead they sent her to another queue for physical check. Baggage reclaim was again furthest point away and we waited 1hr 15mins for first bags to come off. Not one employee in the whole hall to speak to, just stood around like lemmings. Young couple with baby missed their train due to 2hr 40 flight delay then getting out of airport. Nowhere to stay, no money, nothing for baby and no one to talk to.  The whole thing was a sh*tshow and no one was available to help. Avoid if you can, fly from elsewhere",1
345,"The worst airport in the world, I have not seen such crap before. Baton",1
346,"How is Manchester airport still allowed to operate when it's clearly unsafe.  If there was an emergency of some sort in the Check-in halls (which are grossly overrun with travellers), it would be dangerous. The queues are so bad it would be impossible to safely get to an exit. The security areas are rammed with people. On return, the baggage reclaim areas are taking up to 2 hours to return luggage.  All this causes people congestion and unsafe operating.",1
347,Travelled from Manchester airport for a city break in Brussels. Carpark is 2 minute walk from T3. Security was busy so more lanes were opened - got through in 20 minutes. My only gripe was that the carparking is very expensive. What happened to the Jetparks?,4
348,"After hearing all the horror stories about waiting in line for hours on end, I just wanted to say what a brilliant job Manchester airport and easyjet have done today! 40 minutes and my hubby and I had dropped off our luggage, through security and in WHSmiths finding my obligatory holiday read! Good job #manchesterairport #easyjet!",5
349,"This airport has been under some sort of renovation for over ten years. Which is another way of saying it's been a place needing repair for over ten years. Nothing about this place is good. The security staff are disrespectful. The food is very poor quality whilst being hugely over priced... It's like some sort of chav-port with all the low budget airlines. Unless you actually need to be in Manchester... fly anywhere else as it will be better... Need to go to Leeds but don't have a direct flight? Fly to London and get the train up, little difference in travel time, but a more pleasant experience. Or fly via Amsterdam to LBA. Avoid this hell hole at all costs. The company running this ""airport"" have no idea what they are doing... Just compare to any other airport. Literally every single other airport is better than this.If however you really have to go via Manchester, be aware that they heard you into the waiting area early... There is no joy to this place.",1
350,Manchester airport has been given a really rough time lately and I can honestly say we had no issues. We took a Tui flight arrived 3 hours in advance yes we had to queue to book in but only for an hour which is quite normal we were through security in 15 minutes and cannot fault the staff it was all very organised what we did notice was a few of the passengers taking pictures of the queues before checkout was even open and posting them on social media I’m not sure if we were just incredibly lucky or people are making things look worse than it is but we couldn’t fault the airport and the staff who are working very hard to keep things running and also dealing with some very rude customers along the way,5
351,"Multi-million £ salaries for the execs running this shambles, it's a disgrace.  I had seen there had been issues with congestion at security so was prepared for a lengthy queue but that was an issue weeks ago so simply don't understand how this hasn't improved. It was chaos, took an hour to get to the security point. T3 is tiny so can't understand how the reletively modest number of travelers could be so badly handled. Just 2 lanes open plus the fast track. Not that fast track was fairing any better. The terminal itself is very small, crowded and lacking in seating. A problem when you're forced to arrive 3 to 4 hours ahead of your flight just to stand a chance of making your flight. Numerous distressed people were forced to push through the queue through fear of missing flights. Its embarrassing and not good enough. The staff were clearly briefed to blame the passengers for the issue as they all said its because people don't have their liquids out ready. While this can slow things down the cause is 100% the incompetence and apathy of the leadership of the airport.",1
352,"Terrible experience, 1-2 hour queues to get through security, clueless staff who can’t answer any questions and who don’t care. Even turning up 3 hours early is no guarantee that you’ll be able to catch your flight. I have travelled at least once a month from Manchester airport for over 1 year. Do not use this airport if you can avoid it!It’s about time passengers stop paying for the gross incompetence by those who run the airport. Spoke to few members of staff who are obviously stressed and not adequately trained to deal with influxes of  travelers. Travelled 9 May",1
353,What a disgrace! The moment you arrive to drop off or park they find away to charge you money even the trollies have to be paid for. There is no short term parking so say good by to £20 if you have to take disabled people to your he checkin. Not a good ambassador for Manchester,1
354,"Time has come to recognise Manchester airport is out of control,having recently been unfortunate to fly from the airport the lack of organisation going through passport control is totally without apology.why don't  they accept there failings and transfer some of there flights go to liverpool airport who appear to not have the same issues.for the sake of customers accept your management has been lacking and ask liverpool airport to help out and maybe in 12 months or more you can get someone to sort out your problems.",1
355,"Shocking for an international airport, especially arrivals. Landed into T2, took nearly 2 hours to leave the airport as delays with baggage and security. The state of the airport is also noticed with ceilings open and generally a mess! Car park is poorly designed and was a nightmare to leave, considering MAN is up there with the busiest of UK airports, absolutely terrible and will avoid in the future.",1
356,"We arrived at terminal 2 and was shown a queue to join over 250 people. My daughter is autistic and she started to struggle in the queue, we got down to 10 people and she couldnt bring herself to go through the egates alone. I explained to a member of staff and he advised to go through the other queue, we joined the other queue with over 100 people.We were a large family travelling 2 are deaf, 2 on the autism spectrum, 2 carers amongst us most of us got through the egates and was waiting on the other side, a member of staff approached them sarcastically and asked them to get off the steps that they were sitting on. Understandable they posed a fire risk, they got up off the steps and stood further down away from the steps.  The member of staff raised his voice which I heard from the other side of boarder control he told them to move he was border force they had to do as they were told. There was other people further down that he passed on the way up that he did not ask them to move on. My son questioned that there was no signs to say no waiting etc he also pointed out that there were others waiting in the same area. He called my son cocky, some members of staff need to be retrain show some compassion he is 18 years old,flown twice he is a carer he was waiting with his nan and grandad who are both hard of hearing, I was stuck on the other side with my daughter that was also struggling. We managed to get through border control the officer was polite. Some members of staff need to be retrained show some compassion.I know your job is difficult,I stood there and watched them repeat them selves over and over again, some people obviously had language barriers which made it difficult.",1
357,Flew out to Prague with Jet2 on the 13th of May 2022 from terminal 2 manchester airport. I have hidden disabilities and wear a sunflower lanyard to show this. Not one member of staff recognised the lanyard. I was not expecting any real assistance just an acknowledgement. Found the staff at security very rude. Even when obviously struggling to remove my shoes no help offered. This was the first time i have used the sunflower lanyard but on this occasion it was the worst treatment I have received.,1
358,The absolute worst airport I’ve ever visited and unfortunately over the years is just getting more expensive and dirtier instead of improving…,1

Return journey, Ryanair, T3, landed, no ground staff. 30 minutes later, steps arrived. Our pilot got out and had to help put under wing tape up!! Ok getting through passport control but chaos in the pickup outside as two autocrats were forcing people into the multi storey but there was no signage to tell us where to go (on the opposite side of the car park. Found our lift 25 mins later asking 2 staff who didn’t know themselves.  The Gtr Mcr councils and Board on this fiasco have milked our good nature for too long and they should be held to account and forced to give back the unnecessary tolls imposed in their greed and reinvent the once proud service",1
360,Congratulations  to Manchester  Airport. You have designed and built from scratch a pick up system that is not fit for purpose.,1
361,Terminal 2Limited choice of places to eat and nothing for coeliac diet.Seats really really uncomfortable and limited for the amount of people here made worse by a delayed flight. Style over substance,1
362,"left my mobile unattended in terminal 2 departure. When I realized and returned to my seat a member of staff was in possession of it. he told me It could not be returned until it was checked by security. As my flight was boarding and security were no where in sight I had to leave it with him. I was told it would be checked then put in lost property.It is now over a week and my phone would appear to have disappeared.

364,"Picked my wife up today at terminal 1, I was running late so she was waiting for me. I park my car level 1, had a quick coffee and left WOW £12 for just over 30min. This is costing the business lots of money we had a breakfast at another location as the parking fees were double 2 nice coffees. Everyone should use another airport, clearly they do not deserve customers when they charge like this.",1
365,Very dissappointed. Most shops and places to eat closed from 4pm including bars. WHS did a roaring trade as no other places to buy food or drink. Hardly any staff around and this is probably our worst experience ever in a UK airport. Do they know that the airport is part of your holiday experience? Will seek flights from other airports in future.,1
366,"I drove 100 miles to pick up someone from an early Sunday morning arrival. Poor signage - I missed the exit on the roundabout for T2 west pickup car park as the sign wasn't soon enough or big enough - had to drive through drop-off then phone to get let through payment barrier. As you never know how long it can take arrivals to clear security, some people understandably don't want to enter the car park and pay for a possible long wait. I was moved on by police once (where taxis obviously wait) then by airport security from a spot I found to wait. There should be a small set fee for pick-up parking, however long it takes. Who is going to sit in the car park for hours once they have collected their passengers?!Then couldn't get out of the car park because, like several others, it hadn't been made clear to retrieve the token after paying.There seem to be no direction signs to the various hotels at relevant points as you enter the airport. It would save drivers a lot of bother and reduce traffic movements if they can more easily find their way around.",2

No ground staff to allow the plane to park up ! After a delay we had to leave the plane by the lane down front stairs as there were no external stairs available !! Onto baggage claim - no bags for sometime - Manchester Airport cannot claim to want to expand when they cannot handle the current flight numbers !!! Do not fly from Manchester,1
370,What an absolute shambles Manchester airport is I had the pleasure of flying out of this dump last week for a week abroad . Rip off drop off charges ignorant check in staff especially the miserable woman on Ryanair desk no 56 . Massive queues to get through security . I can honestly say the excuses these clowns 🤡 keep coming out with about the pandemic I’m sure Spain had the same issues but no problem there . No more flying from this airport ever for me and my family and I hope everyone else does the same .,1
371,"Traveled by Easyjet to Split in Croatia from Manchester airport last week. It took over two hours to check in the hold bag (2 check in desks open). The queue at Terminal 1 was snaking throughout the check in hall and out the door. It then took over an hour to get through security. (1 scanner unit open initially) If the flight had not been delayed I would have missed my flight. Once on the plane there were further delays due lack of ground crew to push the plane out. The whole experience was a complete farce and has led me to a decision, I will not use Manchester airport ever again.",1
372,"Missed my flight at Manchester Airport.Security in T1 is shocking.Only 4 out of 14 Security Lanes open.Plenty of staff keeping travellers in line, but totally lacking in the security Lanes. I feel for the staff trying to do a job, but totally under resourced. I will continue to avoid this airport. Shocking!",1
373,"Flew from T2 19th April and returned 9th May. Got through check in and security in 30 minutes going out, our return flight landed at 9.30pm, we were through security in 10 minutes and by the time we got to baggage reclaim our bags were there on the conveyor belt. Never has Manchester airport been so efficient. Well done 👏",5
374,"Arrived at 6.30 am, really helpful staff, bags checked in and through security in under 15 minutes. Amazing considering all the scare stories. Shops all open when through security!",5
375,"Long queue for security; only half the shops open; flight delayed over an hour due to a lack of staff and therefore a lack of steps to the aircraft. Staff everywhere were friendly and tried their best, but really this kind of management is unacceptable. Shame on them",1
376,Just returned from Tenerife to Manchester Airport. No queues either way very helpful staff. Landed at 8.24 had been through security and collected bags and were waiting for taxi well within 30 minutes. Well done we were very impressed with efficiency,5
377,I've missed my flight today at Manchester airport due to over crowded security lines and airport being short staff. It's a worst airport ever.,1
378,"Terrible experience, 2 hour queues to get through security, clueless staff who can’t answer any questions and who don’t care. Even turning up 3 hours early is no guarantee that you’ll be able to catch your flight. I’m a Mancunian who has travelled at least once a month from Manchester airport for over 20 years. Do not use this airport!It’s about time passengers stop paying for the gross incompetence by those who run the airport.",1
379,Lack of facilities early evening was astounding.  Flew into T3 around 7pm and walked to the station in T1.  Was hoping to find somewhere to buy a sandwich and a drink on the way as I'd left home around 3pm and wouldn't be arriving at my destination until 10pm.  I only passed a couple of concessions and both were closed.  Eventually found vending machines on the station platform and ended up having an over priced packet of crisps and bar or chocolate.On the return journey the queue at security was a nightmare.  No staff managing the queue.  It took us over an hour to get through it.,2
380,"One of the worse experiences of my life getting through security. No staff, passengers having to shout out over rows of people, other stressed passengers accusing each other of pushing in, no management and flight delayed over an hour as a result. Disgusting.",1
381,Special Assistance really needs a swift kick up the Backside My husband is disabled when we arrived back last Tuesday got told they had no knowledge of a carry off it was a carry on so did they think he would get better 2 weeks away. It then took 2 hours to get him off the plane and fire brigade had to be brought in to lift him off as there was only one assistant the other one said at 7.10pm i finish at 7.30 i am going. My husband has been put off flying now.,1
382,"Travelled on Sunday morning 8th May.Very quick and easy check in at Jet 2.Security only smallish queue and most of staff very friendly but you still get an odd one that's aggressive and dictatorial, in this particular case a girl directing people to screenings. I know they have to be effective and efficient but there is a dividing line here and airport staff do need to win back people's trust and respect and shouting curt instructions when nothing is clearly indicated isn't the way to it in my view.Anyway, short moan over, and overall a relatively stress free and friendly experience.Eddie Mc",4
383,"Arrived early due to all the queues.  Security didn’t open until 3 am- so waited an hour on the floor. Others behind me had massive queues. In the terminal after security, most places were not open until 4 am. Couldn’t book the airport lounge as not open until 5 am. Everywhere to eat or drink had extremely long queues- so more queuing. Boots not much choice of snacks in stock on the shelves. Costa long long queues 50 People queuing for a coffee. Bar, massive queues of probably about 60 people to get a drink, with only 2 staff serving. No snacks in duty free. And absolutely no where to sit, as every seat was full.  I’ve been up all night and not a pleasant way to start a holiday.",1
384,"I arrived at Manchester T1, what a disaster. We waited for 45 minutes for assistance to arrive, 4 of us as usual left feeling uncared for. I travel several times a year and this last 12 months is a joke. The management needs a good shake up,try leaving the office and go and see how the failing airport works.  I've never seen staff morale so low, the staff are pulling and pushing two wheelchairs at a time.",1
385,"Very poorArrived 3hours early as advised to T3Check in was fine but then  we had 2hours to wait with very poor facilities, most were closed, it was very difficult to get something to drink and eat",1
386,Quick and easy'Terminal 2.I was dreading using Manchester Airport having read recent reports. However there was no problem.Going through security took less than 10 minutes so no complaints. Return was even better. No queue at passport control and luggage on the carousel when I arrived. Longest time was walking from gate to passport control.,5
387,"With the accurate reports of long queues at Manchester airport Terminal 1 and finding the special assistance entry to security closed at a trip in February we thought it best to check the situation before arrival at the airportBeing unable to telephone the airport we sent an email to Charlie Cornish the acting CEOWe received a prompt reply saying that there should be no reason why this special assistance entrance to security should not be openChecking in luggage was a nightmare as queues were almost out of the terminal door !Despite having Priority drop off with Easyjet the airport staff were directing everyone to ANY  drop off luggage queue including the Easyjet Priority queue,which was 90% full of non priority customers !Thanks to an easyjet person we were able to check in bags quickly!On arriving at the Special Assistance entry to Security we were refused entry as only cabin crew and airport staff were being allowed to use it !- thanks Mr CornishSo back to the mile long queue for normal security and fortunate to find a member of staff who got us through quickly with our priority paperworkWe appreciate more travellers and staff shortage due to lay offs during Covid has put great pressures upon the airport ,but this is no excuse for ignoring the needs of customers with special assistance needs.",1
388,"T3 Manchester Airport - appalling experience. 90 minutes for security then most cafes, shops and bars closed in departure area. An hour queue to buy a drink! Also the area is filthy with used glasses and other litter throughout the terminal. Whoever is “managing” this airport should be ashamed. Worst airport in the country.",1
389,"Don’t bother. Crowded, dirty, under resourced, 1hr queue for drinks and limited and appalling food. Nobody cares and nobody is interested in making it any better. Worst airport/terminal in the country.",1
390,"I was flying recently from Terminal 3 at Manchester airport.  I went into the gender neutral toilets in the departure lounge. In theory, I support equality for every single person on the planet. In practice, I could not find a cubicle that didn’t have urine all over the toilet seats and floor. There were many cubicles where the lock didn’t work. There was a man weaving about and bumping into the toilet doors.  Altogether, it was the worst experience I have had of public toilets in my lifetime.",1
391,"Reading the reviews below I can only agree that Manchester Airport is the worst I have had the misfortune to travel through.  It embodies all the worst aspects of local authority ownership.  To name but a few issues:Rip off parkingSlow check in and securityLifts, escalators and travelators not working or simply switched offNo stairs at dis embarking availableFurther delays on dis embarking due to shortage of staffPoor facilities including dirty and smelly toilets including in the re furbished T2Bring on privatisation and proper accountability.Utter shambles.  Management is a disgrace to the city of Manchester.",1
392,My daughter her husband and there 2 and 3 years of age children went on there long awaited holiday this morning. Queues horrendous and as for security she told me while she was in tears how one of the security treated her 3 year old son. He’s got autism and was scared to walk through the scanner. He wouldn’t let her husband go round to get his son from the other side of the scanner a stranger had to pass him through to him. They took her son into a room with his dad to search him. Why couldn’t they just let him carry him. Like young babies get carried. He was uncontrollable as you can expect. This is not going to be forgotten about. I think security need training as they don’t know how to deal with there customers. The experience they had has now put them off going away. Manchester airport security you should be ashamed of yourselves. This would have been a 0 but they don’t give that option,1
393,The worst Airport I have ever been in.In Terminal 3 we queued for more than 30 mins in a Disney style queue for security screening. As far as I could see there was ONE belt in operation. Then we made our way to the Concourse area where people had to sit on stair steps as there simply was not enough seats. My heart went out to families. Then our flight was 1 hour delayed and this never registered on the Departures screens. The queue for food was ridiculous and totally insufficient seating. This was on a Tuesday at 15:00.,1
394,"Despite current times for the airport, I can honestly say the staff are all extremely helpful. They will go above and beyond to assist you, and always with a smile.",5
395,"The absolute worst airport experience ever. Two hours to get through to departures as there were two security checks open. Some of the staff were quite rude and split me and my mum up when she was clearly quite fraught. Then, when you finally get through, a shortage of food and beverages in the restaurants. Avoid at all costs.",1
396,"Absolute chaos having arrived early and completed our bag drop we join a huge queue only to be told that we were in the prioritized queue, we then joined a even bigger queue, after 30 mins not moving a tannoy announcement said they were experiencing queues due to a fire alarm😂😂😂 well theirs another problem as no one heard a fire alarm so we could potentially burn to death and no one has been evacuated. I will always try and avoid this airport it a absolute disaster zone. Still waiting",1
397,"Our experience this morning was nothing short of horrific! No staff on check in so all self service. Queues horrendous, poor organisation from the 3 members of staff we saw milling around. Then the ""travesty"" of security came next. Paid for fast track, no such thing, took well over an hour to be filtered into the normal queue. 3 stations open for thousands of passengers! No one had a clue what they were doing and when we did put our belongings in a tray, had to then fight our way through to be frisked at the other side of security! Our bags just left back at the other end where anyone and everyone had access to them! This airport should be closed down! Its a disgrace.",1
398,"If I could put a 0, i would. 2 hours waiting queues for the airport, they oblige you to throw away all the liquid bottles that do not fit in a small bag (never experienced that in another airport) but they completely forget to control the passports. Dangerous priorities when speaking about security. An awful experience. True to the bad reputation oc this airport",1
399,"No staff, no organisation and on the whole probably one of the worst experiences I’ve had at an airport",1
400,"An awful, stessful, horrible experience to travel through Manchester Airport today. Only a couple of Security checks open, thousands of travellers, people standing in lines for hours, many missing their flights due to bureacracy and a total lack of positive attitude towards the guests. With more than 10 potential Security checks, one definitely wonders why the majority of Them are closed on an awfully busy Friday afternoon. The thought of having to ever go back to a mis-organized airport like that scares me!",1
401,Shambles and beyond s h ! T .. Well done for being the most incompetent airport in Europe..,1
402,"My experience this morning, 29/04/22.T1.I arrived at 04.35 to catch a flight at 07.20am.I had already checked in and had a seat number.I joined the long queue for bag drop, then for security which extended beyond the front doors. I failed to reach security in time to catch my flight even though I stood in lines for more than two and a half hours.I was travelling alone but a small group of people in the line around me, also missed their flights.The experience was awful but there was consolation in the fact I had Saga Travel Insurance.Sadly untrue.This afternoon I discovered the insurance does not cover this incident. I have lost my holiday and my money. Travellers beware!",1
403,"Would give 0 stars if option allowed. Elderly parents and relative, all aged 70+ arrived at T2 on 25th April. 2 other flights landed either side of their flight. They had to wait over 2 hours due to no trollies been available to transport luggage, all they required was 1 trolly. Flight landed at 14.30 whilst they met us at 16:45. To add insult to injury, was charged (robbed) £30 for a stay lasting 2 hours 4 minutes. Airport is ridden with well documented problems, heads must toll. Brand shiny new terminal but no trollies, lack of staff and humongous security and passport control queues. Bring your own trolly if arriving at Manchester airport. Or as i will be doing, boycotting travelling via Manchester airport until they sort this self inflicted problems and mess out.",1
404,"Flew out very early on Saturday 23rd April. Warned about possible queuing delays so arrived over 3hrs before out flight was due to leave. After 1.5hrs of trying to check in baggage I finally got through and sent to a baggage drop area. Still over an hour to drop the bags and get through security and to the gate. Plenty of time right! Wrong!! Conveyor belt kept breaking down. Then got left with another 50+ people just waiting with no idea what's going on. Customer service agents didn't offer any information even when asked they didn't have a clue. I now had 45mins before my flight was due to leave and still had my hold luggage! Getting more and more annoyed I spoke to someone senior who also wasn't helpful and pretty rude tbh. After finally getting my luggage sorted, I went to security, another long queue. Asked to be prioritised due to my flight leaving in 35mins. Refused saying I had loads of time!I didn't as security was slow as per usual. Ended up having to sprint for the plane as final boarding was being called! Absolute shambles of an airport! 1 of the biggest airports in the UK and they can't sort out the basics! Whoever runs this places needs firing!Not just once is customer service poor in both the check in and security but its every time I fly and has never improved. In fact its got worse! Think I'll be paying a bit more and fly from smaller airports next time!",1
405,"Don't leave many reviews but am compelled to write about the positive experience my family had at Terminal 2 on Tuesday 12th April. Flying with TUI, arrived nearly 4 hours early and expecting the worst based on media coverage. Check-in area relatively quiet, queued for about 20 minutes. Security queue about 10 mins. Got very nearly to front and my 3 year old needed the toilet and said it couldn't wait (nightmare!). Staff were excellent, escorted us back to check-in hall, through the barriers making us known to the staff manning them. Afterwards  saw us back into security and through fast track so we didn't have to queue again. Last thing they probably needed given the pressure they have been under so I really appreciate how accommodating they were...i'd expected to have to rejoin back of queue! Arriving back at Manchester after a 9 night break, disappointing to wait the best part of 1 hour 30 for our bags to come through but given the overall experience we had compared with what we were expecting, i don't think this is something to dwell on. Thank you to the kind staff who helped me and my little one!",4
406,"Manchester Airport let us down totally on the 1st April 2022An extract from my recent complaint;1 The security queues and fast track security.Arrived at 16.20 for security A. It took around half an hour to get to the fast track point, where the member of staff was not interested in scanning the passes as it was total chaos.It then took us until 18.48 to pass security. It was an utter shambles, with passengers pushing in and the security staff being totally overwhelmed.This was almost an hour after our flight was supposed to leave. thankfully everyone was in the same situation, so we made it to the flight.As a result I purchased 6 fastrack passes which were totally redundant as the fastrack queue was actually longer than the normal queue. 2 The Escape Lounge bookingAs a direct result of the ludicrous security queues we were unable to use the lounge as we had to run from security to the plane. 3 The drop and go parkingAfter experiencing the horrendous situation with security on the way out to Faro, we decided to not use Manchester airport for our return and booked to go back to Liverpool airport earlier. I called the number on my ticket for drop and go to rearrange the time. When I returned to the car park at the rearranged time my key was not available. I pick up the phone and am told that my booking has been cancelled accidentally by a new member of staff.I have to wait around 40 minutes to finally get my car as it was blocked in by numerous other cars.Manchester airport provided the worst experience I have ever seen in April. I will never choose to use the airport again. I fly around 15 times per year and have never seen disorganisation or a total lack of staff like we witnessed, it ruined our holiday.I would like a refund for the fast track security, the Escape lounge and compensation for the shocking service I received from Drop and Go. A total of £192.49 was spent with Manchester Airport and not one service was provided properly.",1
407,"Attempted to pick up my family from terminal 3, they had been away on a 10 day break.Missed the signs for arrivals; there was none. Concerned that I would penalised if I used the short stay car park in case the flight was delayed so I took a risk went into the ""medium stay car park where most of the signs/instructions told me about the abundance of contract parking, this was quite a walk from the terminal,  however the flight was early by 15 minutes so I was there less than 45 minutes; cost £12.00.  Went to the ATM cost to get cash £3.00.I used to be proud of my airport but now I feel its not for travelling passengers but pure profit.",1
408,"Embarasment for North West. Shame on you! Terrible airport, rude unfriedly clueless staff on terminal 1!I came 3 hrs before gate was closing and i almost missed my flight!Endless ques, no managements whatsoever, passengers missing flight s.Staff accusing people to smuggling drugs, asking them where they had their bags etc, checking everyone like we all terrorists. Disgusting!! From 5 securities line ONE was running?!On way back, terminal 3 - bags everywhere, long time waited for bags to even be put on runners. Bags all over the airport, random piles of hundreds of lagguage.",1
409,"Welcome to RIP OFF BRITAIN!A very limited number of places to eat before a flight, with several of them closed, limiting choice. We chose The Grain Loft. WOW! Pub food at ridiculously expensive prices. A Steak and Ale pie, with mash, pees and gravy was a whopping £16.95. I can get TWO meals like this in my local Greene King pub for £10!!!! Nothing inferior in Greene King either. Similar, if not better quality!Chicken Tikka Masala was £15.49 and again is available in silmilar quality/quantity at my local Greene King on their 2 for £10 menu.A meal for two was a whopping £43.98 including a couple (Yes, only two) beers, and their app was expecting us to leave a tip. WHAT? AT THOSE PRICES YOU EXPECT A TIP TOO?????In the 1970's my dad was Finance Manager for the BAA at Gatwick Airport. One of the things he did was to limit the prices that the franchises on site could charge on BAA property, making sure that average families with children were able to get decent food at a reasonable price, when going on holiday. Manchester Airport seriously needs to take a look at my dad's policies and implement them.PRONTO!Needless to say, we will make sure in future that we have eaten BEFORE arriving at Manchester airport, or bring food with us rather than be ripped off to this extent!",1
410,"I’ve been to maybe 50 different airports in my life and Manchester airport is by far the worst. First of all £5 to be dropped off is ridiculous, then you have to go through a large, winding, busy shop to get to the terminal (which absolutely reeks of perfume and sets off my allergies) Then the smoking area is literally hell on earth, a stinking cage tucked away on the side of the building reminiscent of a prison yard.The airport layout makes no sense, compared to other European airports it’s an embarrassment. God I hate this place.",1
411,"Never being treaded so bad. The staff was very unpolite, shouting and stressfull. The security check was worst, we were treaded like animals in a slaughterhouse. No help, No smile, only hard, loud and heartless commands. People were actually crying. Add,  that the screen changed from ""relax"" directly to ""Final Call"". That was quite stressfull.",1
412,"It pains me to admit it, but Manchester airport is awful, when compared to Liverpool, on every single level.Drop off fees excessive, massive security queues, very long walks to gates, often unfriendly staff, many inadequately trained. Given the option, everyone I know would pick Liverpool every time. No redeeming factors at Manchester airport.",1
413,Flying out to Hamburg 18/4-22What a nightmare. Long queues. No structure. Lack of signs when arriving. Staff wit a temperBarely made the flight You need to have a good health flying out of Manchester,1
414,"It's fair to say that I arrived at the airport full of trepidation given the recent horror stories about Manchester. However, security was a breeze. Maybe good luck, maybe they have got their act together? However, the information on the screens is woefully out of date. As I await my flight I am reading a screen which tells me to ""BE READY TO RE-ENTER THE UK"" before it proceeds to provide me, and all other passengers, confusing, misleading and just wrong information about the requirements on my return home. It witters on about contact locator forms which have been redundant for at least a month according to the gov UK website. Who'd have thought I would be praising the government for getting something right but they have and Manchester airport have not, again. It's not difficult is it?",3
415,"Avoid Terminal 2 if you can. Flew to Cyprus yesterday from the new highly anticipated T2.Manchester City Council and those responsible for the redesign and management should be embarrassed by the waste of money. It is clearly a mish mash of poor ideas, lack of thought to user experience and atrociously run. It is effectively a poor 70's shopping mall with extremely long distances to travel from security to gate without adequate circulation, toilets and lifts. Flew yesterday and it was carnage. I requested special assistance for my father and as the wait was so long, I had to push him with hand luggage on his lap through the airport. Security staff were rude, aggressive and the system itself flawed. They  made my father get out of the wheelchair and walk through x rays, but demanded that his walking stick went through one scanner and his bags another. It meant I was split from my father who became confused and then abandoned as I went to find his stick which was in another scanning lane. When I explained that this system did not work the staff member told me ""it works for us don't care about you"". Having got through security I had hoped the journey might improve. Sadly it gets worse. The duty free, lounge areas are too small to handle busy capacity with queues for all restaurants, and not enough lifts to get there. Toilets are disgusting with no separate wash facilities for faiths that require them, so passengers were washing feet in sinks, water on floors and no staff to clean up.The overall experience is that of  a large tin shed with poor finishes and many materials that are used for hospital fit outs. There isn't enough seating and most was mimicking park benches, uncomfortable and inappropriate. Then it gets worse - when travelling to a gate to catch your plane the distances are really long without enough lifts to take passengers to lower levels. In fact, when we got to our gate and eventually received assistance, the lady who helped us had said numerous elderly passengers had collapsed at gates recently through distress and exhaustion. Ultimately this new Terminal is poorly designed, executed and operated. Manchester City Council have clearly looked at bottom line costs with the design team/contractors not creating a world class facility. This is already not fit for purpose and will not be able to handle the busiest periods of the year let alone offer a great lasting departure for Manchester. Sadly this will be memorable for all the wrong reasons.",1
416,Flew with Emirates to Oman. One of our bags never arrived which was full of gifts for friends and relatives. Emirates say bag never left Manchester but nowhere to be found. Bag arrived 5 weeks later with 90 % of contents missing. Emirates customer service are not interested and baggage reclaim at Manchester are hopeless. Be very careful what you put in your hold luggage as staff at Manchester are stealing contents . Very sad when you can’t trust that your baggage will arrive with all its contents,1
417,"Took over 2.5 hours to get through security, boarding the plane was slightly delayed, and once on the plane we had to wait 2 hours for them to load the bags before we could take off. The flight home was also delayed because of Manchester airport and when we arrived, two of our suitcases had been damaged.",2
418,"Dropped my son,wife and 2 young children off at Terminal 1..Charged £5.00 for 5 mins..( Extorinate)The check in experience they had was unbelievable..The security check was the same...If you are going to Europe on short haul..Go to Liverpool Airport..Running very smooth there.",2
419,"I have travelled worldwide on business for the last thirty years. Despite living only 15 minutes from Manchester Airport, I can say, without hesitation that it is the worst international airport I have ever had the misfortune of using. There are so many failings, it's difficult to list them all. The experience starts with a disgusting charge simply to be dropped off by car - what an outrage! Checkin is very much pot-luck. If you fly business on Singapore or Emirates then it's usually acceptable, but if you're unlucky enough to be flying a short haul or budget carrier then it's dreadful. And then there's security....what an utter disgrace. Aside from the queues (cause by opening only three of the ten checkpoints), it is the attitude and demeanour of the staff that is really the problem. The sullen, aggressive and petty behaviour of some staff is beneath contempt. The pointless and intrusive (and quite deliberate) hand searching of bags belonging to people (often children or elderly women) who represent the very lowest level of risk, followed by an aggressive raking through personal belongings of no significance is quite appalling. If the management of MAG had any sense of responsibility or accountability they would resign. This is the worst airport in Europe Avoid it at all costs",1
420,"Reaching new depths of customer service. Delayed again and again. Took almost 4 hours to get through security for a flight to Inverness. In the end, we missed the plane by almost 30 minutes and thereby lost a days work. Utter shambles. Staff and passengers stressed out. Airport rammed, not enough security staff, broken equipment, ignorant staff. Worst I've ever experienced and I've been flying for over 30 years.",1
421,"Traveled through Terminal 1 last Sunday. Turkish Airlines afternoon flight to Istanbul.Didn't know what to expect due to the media. But, ok was busy, but no real problems. Queued about 10 minutes at the check in and maybe another 10 minutes at security. Just the restaurants upstairs that you needed to queue for a while, so opted for a sandwich downstairs instead..Nothing as bad as I was expecting.Also I travelled through Terminal 1 two weeks before and about the same. Flying Easyjet to Amsterdam. Maybe 20 minutes at security.",4

I flew 3 times this year and they have never been working.Tramps sleeping in the train station area in sleeping bags.What about the broken toilets and bag covering one of the sinks in terminal 2 baggage collection? This is the probably the first thing a tourist will see.We waited approx 1 and half hour for our bags to arrive,  kids had been on a long flight it was 6.30am and no sleep and 5 hours time difference. They say they need qualified staff for security but hiw much training do you need to put a suitcase on a conveyor belt?This is bad management, whoever is in charge should be ashamed. I feel ashamed for any International visitor.",1

425,"Travelled from T2 on Sunday 10th April. Arrived at 4.20am for a 7.55am flight. Hand luggage only so straight to security.  There were queues but they were moving steadily. Well manned with staff who are instructing passengers how to load items into security boxes for scanners. Unfortunately lots of passengers not listening which is essentially whats causing the delays. You cannot have liquids in your bags they must be in a clear plastic bag which you put into the grey boxes. And please people get off your phones! We queued for a short time and at least 12 people were asked to get off their phones as they weren't paying attention and were holding things up!! All in all from arrival to getting airline was 40minutes for us. Really impressed especially after reading reports prior to travel. Staff are friendly, helpful and amazingly patient with travellers who simply aren't listening. Queues for food at all restaurants but again these are moving and if you allow time and have patience you'll be fine. All in all a very relaxed, enjoyable experience far removed from what we'd braced for. We'll done to the staff.",4
426,"Every time I fly out of Manchester airport, my experience is terrible. I travel the world for work and Manchester airport ranks among the WORST. Lately, queues at check-in and security have been horrendously long (taking me three and four hours to get through on the two last occasions), security staff is threatening and petty and I have witnessed some real agressive behaviour. I have heard that this shocking service at a Western European airport has to do with employment policies. The staff are on terrible employment contracts and this is clearly reflected on the overall atmosphere at the airport.If you have any other option, avoid this airport at all costs.",1

In actual fact, Manchester Airport have actually done what they said earlier in the week and got to grips with the staffing issues, the staff are the best I’ve dealt with in Manchester Airport ever, they were very attentive to passengers arriving at T1 and letting them know where to go.

Very impressed well done Manchester Airport, you’ve had bad press this week, but you have definitely delivered today WELL DONE.",5

You can cater for Vegan and Vegi but not for an actual allergy - there's nothing for us!! It is an absolute disgrace. Nothing will actually be done about this but it is nice to get it off my chest into the open.",1
432,"After reading these reviews I was worried but although check in took about an hour and a half (TUI), security was totally empty and we were through in under 5 minutes. This was terminal 2 on Friday 8th",4
433,utter disgrace- cancelled in the end and lost thousands thanks to this airport- we should all be suing the airport,1
434,"Not fit for purpose, hopeless .",1
435,Manchester Airport 🤯,1
436,"WHAT A RIP OFF!!!!I dropped a colleague off at Terminal 1 yesterday. Up the ramp, he got out the car, I drove down the ramp and got CHARGED £5 for the privilege. WHAT AN ABSOLUTE DISGRACE!!",1
437,A complete disaster. How can this international airport can have any credibility after recent events ?,1
438,We arrived at 03.40 and sailed through check in. When we got to security we joined and queue just after the entrance. The queue was long but moved quickly so it didn't seem to take much longer than normal. One very big problem i did encounter though was our trays got passed the body scanner far quicker than we did and by the time we cought up with the trays someone had helped themselves to a 100 jacket. So be very wary of your belongings. Staff could not help me with a way forward for this problem.,2
439,"Relatively speaking we had an easier time at this airport on 01 April than the next day when the whole shebang of long waits resulting in some unfortunate travellers missing some flights. The UK press reported this debacle on the front pages - not a good recommendation, is it Board of Directors?So altogether we spent an hour negotiating security in the same claustrophobic, basement-like place which has been there for years.At the end of it we looked forward to visiting the fast-food place and bar. Fast food? - forget it as there was a 30 minute wait just to get a drink and sandwich.Don't you sometimes think that these places should be paying the customer just to make amends? I could go on but this is definitely the sorriest airport in the UK - possibly in all the developed world.Wake up, airport management or at least focus on looking after the customers instead of anticipating your usual unearned annual bonuses.You are dependent upon your customers, not the other way round and isn't it interesting that a regional airport just 40 miles east of Manchester (I don't think Trustpilot will allow me to name it) has been voted top UK airport last year.My review title is self-explanatory and Manchester Airport is nothing but a national disgrace.Do yourself a favour and give it a wide berth.",1
440,"Had to get to Manchester four hours before our flight, the queue for security was long but we managed to get through, flight was then delayed for 1hr 30 mins, due to airspace, i would not recommend flying from this airport , the new terminal was a waste of money as they haven’t got the staff to man it, will look for an alternative airport in future , dreading flying back there as the wait for baggage is ridiculous",1
441,"Had expected long delays given all the recent news reports. Managed to do all bag drops and security in under an hour at terminal 2 this am (Wed 6th). Very efficient and hard working staff, keeping cheerful.",5
442,"Absolutely scandalous!!! Over 3 hrs to get through security going out. On return the bags never came off the plane. No body there to advise or help. Certainly no one at baggage reclaim customer service. Left the airport 3hrs after landing without my bag. No idea if I’ll get it back. This airport should not be allowed to open. It’s not fit for purpose, complete shambles.",1
443,Big thank you to Ben at terminal 1 departures. Helped us with our surfboards and then got us through security. Someone get that man a pint.,5
444,How can you report this disgraceful International Airport as good.  It's been a shambles for years. Now its 3rd world.I used it December 2021 & February 2022.From train station [for antigen test] to terminal 2 a long walk. Then 2 & half hours checking in through to security. It wasn't as bad as now. Whoever is running this catastrophe should be fired forthwith. No doubt he'll get a golden handshake for failure. Like most in charge in this country.,1
445,Just returned from a ski holiday via Manchester Airport. Was worried after reading the reviews but after experiencing the total chaos they are well justified. Going out was not too bad apart from security unable to cope with the scanning of bags. Most were being rejected and had to go back round again and again. The return flight was a real pain. Only two people stacking suitcases onto the carrousel. For the whole of T2! They took absolutly ages which caused us and many others to miss the last train home. Plus when mine did come it had been dropped and damaged. Many staff saying sorry but blaming on the Airport unable to employ enough people. Next year will drive! And when next needing to fly will avoid this place. Need a management change/sackings. Typical council run mess.,1
446,Just to drop off and pick up on my return which only took a couple of minutes cost £11. A complete rip-off and very unwelcoming. This once reputable airport isn't interested in creating a good experience for the traveller. I no longer buy anything whilst in the airport and if everyone else did the same I think there might just be a change in their thinking about profiteering.,1
447,Chaos.Over an hour to get airside.  Boarding pass scanners failed three times in a hour then only 2 of the 5 security check lanes open. Plenty of money spent on the duty free and swanky shopping area airside but security woefully under funded. Get your priorities right Manchester… second city 😂😂 Avoid !!,1
448,"After looking at the reviews for Manchester Airport Terminal 2 and the queues prior to going away, we decided to pay £10 for the fastrack.  Well what a waste of money, the queues for this were lengthy, as I assume everyone was thinking the same. We queued up to go through and there were issues with the machines scanning boarding passes. We eventually got through to another queue to put our hand luggage through the scanner, where approx 50% of the bags were having to be searched again by hand.  My husbands bag was ok, but mine had to be searched again.  I knew I didn’t have any liquid, but it took another 20 mins for my bag to be looked at again and eventually they thought the problem was a packet of polos, which she thought was the issue ( but not 100% sure).  We were on an early flight from Terminal 2 and managed to get a table in one of the bars, as the morning progressed, we noticed how many people were having to queue for 20-30 mins to get a table, it doesn’t appear that there are enough places to eat for the number of passengers departing.  On our return flight, we arrived back into Terminal 2, passport control wasn’t too bad, but when we got to the luggage carousel, we waited for over an hour before the carousel started to move.  A few cases came out and then the carousel stopped again.  People were getting very frustrated and trying to find someone to ask what the problems were, but no staff about or those who did walk through the area, didn’t know anything.  Eventually after another 30 mins the luggage started to come out again.  I just wish Management would communicate with their customers to update them on any issues or lack of baggage staff, as people would prefer to know what is happening rather than just standing waiting and getting more frustrated.",1
449,My recent trip to Madrid was excellent. I had a lovely easy experience at the airport on my way out and on my return. Nothing to add but praise for all the lovely staff I encountered from check in to security to shop assistants.,5
450,"Manchester has been the closest airport to me since birth and It’s progressively getting worse for both departures and arrivals. My most recent holiday last month - 2.5 hour checkin, had an airport lounge booked we couldn’t even use as the plane was boarding. Then coming home 3 hours from landing to getting our bags.",1
451,Two words ‘DONT BOTHER’ Enough already has been said about this place!,1
452,Total shambles I've been from here twice in the last month and twice 2 hours plus in security the management are a joke surely they must have known what was going to happen they should have had the foresight to employ more people and they say it's the same everywhere not true how is it no more than 10 minutes in both Berlin and Lisbon avoid at all costs,1
453,"Worst airport i ever been to , and i have traveled quite a LOT on the third world- Security is a joke. The normal queue was around 2-3 hours- nothing works - staff is stressed - wouldnt have guessed that anyone is working within the field of logistics",1
454,Arrived at T2 Manchester airport with Jet2.   What a ridiculous walk you have to passport control.  Not one of the travelling walkways were working.  So many struggling.  Luckily the man on fast track saw me and called me down so I missed queueing. Let me travel from Leeds Bradford any day.  Manchester need to Go Tenerife to get some tips how to work security.  Took 10 mins only to clear,1
455,"Diabolical - queue after queue and delay after delay. No staff, no plan and no customer service.Terrible airport - I will not use again A terrible start to a holiday due to the airports incompetence",1
456,"Diabolical from start to finish, massive queues for security because 60% of scanners weren't staffed...a total rip off and absolutely filthy.",1
457,"When our return flight from Cyprus arrived back in Manchester Airport on time and we passed through immigration control quickly and without incident I was optimistic about a rapid exit. How wrong I was! We entered the baggage reclaim section just in time to see our bag on the carousel going back through the hole in the wall along with many others and then inexplicably the carousel stopped, with our bag (and many other people’s) stuck behind the screen, tantalisingly out of reach. It was midnight and there was no one around to help, the baggage reclaim office was empty and so we were trapped until the carousel started again. Well we waited, watched, waited, looked for someone to help, shouted for someone to help through the hole in the wall, waited some more and grew increasingly frustrated and desperate. After an hour a man wearing a high vis jacket walked through the hall, oblivious to the problem. The people waiting with me by now were furious and pounced upon him, but he explained it was nothing to do with him and he couldn’t help. He said that the airport was understaffed and nothing worked properly anymore. Great!Eventually the carousel started going again and we managed to get our bag, after an hour waiting. The sheer incompetence and indifference of the airport management is staggering. Passengers are treated as inconvenient cattle. Well, until the senior management at Manchester Airport is replaced I shall be voting with my feet and flying from other airports. My advice is to avoid Manchester Airport like the plague.",1
458,"The worst airport I used, fast track takes 50 minutes, check-out lasted 2 hours with small children, no information by Staff to find out something.",1
459,Queues upon queues.  Delays at every possible point in the system.  Delays upon delays.  Zero customer service.  No strategic planning for increased demand as the pandemic eases (despite having two years to prepare).  Just the worst airport I have ever visited and yet they charge £5 to drop off customers and levy extortionate parking charges (including pickup).  The management have no shame.  Vote with your your feet and avoid at all costs.,1
460,"Cannot understand.There have been complaints for years,the Council are not bothered,Andy Burnham the Mayor has not had decency to respond to any of my numerous complaints.Pathetic organisation from top to bottom.PSAre the TEN Manchester Authorities who are part owners of this shambles in any way embarrassed or typically just happy to take the money.Do councillors have a separate entry and exit so they don’t have to see the carnage and mix with the common people?Well must be an election coming up .Even the elected mayor (burnham) acknowledges a problemPity he didn’t respond to my emails about this third world excuse for an airport back to 2019.Still police betterused at the airport than fighting crimeSame for fire fighters !!",1
461,"Queues at the airport security, well, how many hours do you expect to stand crushed together in an overheated hall just to have a bag checked, they now want you at the airport 3 hours in advance, and still you will be lucky to catch your flight.They moaned all thru the pandemic about people numbers, now they have the people, they cannot handle them.Enough to put you off flying forever. If you can, fly from somewhere else that don’t seem to have the same problems, like Liverpool.",1
462,Check in and security checks are a disgrace! Had to queue jump by asking staff as would of missed our flight even though we were there 3 and a half hours early! even then flight was boarding as we raced through. Management need a serious look at this! Will avoid using if at all possible,1
463,"Without doubt the worst airport experience I have ever had and I’ve travelled extensively. Over 2 hours to get through security. Lounges all closed or restricted due to no staff. Half the restaurants and eateries closed. No staff anywhere. Our flight was delayed 75 minutes whilst waiting for passengers to clear security, 20 didn’t make it. Completely unacceptable. The CEO of the airport and her management team are incompetent and should be replaced with a capable and dynamic team immediately. I’m a hospitality director and there is zero excuse for not planning a successful structured reopening plan.",1
464,"Disaster  at Manchester Airport  yesterday from start to finish. Queues  a mile long at check-in as system crashed. Security  desks A was closed at Terminal 1 only desk B open and 90 minutes + to  get through. Sat on plane before  take off  for 2.5 hours, which  meant 3.5 hours  in total  delay. To top it off  when we arrived at  Istanbul  Airport  we discovered that numerous cases hadn't been  loaded onto the flight. As of this posting we are still awaiting  news as to when we will  receive our luggage.",1
465,"I cannot, and would not recommend flying from Manchester airport to anyone. Even if you live in Manchester, I would recommend travelling to an alternative airport. I flew from Manchester Airport on Thursday 31st March, at the start of the Easter holiday season, and can only describe the place as being in abject chaos. Thousands of passengers were either queueing to check in or queueing to go through security checks. The airport staff, what little of them there are, were harassed, polite but clearly stressed that they weren’t supported by management as they were trying to get legions of people through security. At no point during my time of queueing for security in nearly 2 hours did I see anyone from senior management appear to “muck in”. There clearly aren’t enough people employed by Manchester Airport to deal with the volume of passengers travelling through the terminal. Which is why at times of high volume footfall it should be all hands to the deck. Another wonderful customer came out of the queue and started telling people who had flights due to leave at 09:00 or earlier to come and join a priority queue! A CUSTOMER! Not a member of staff! Had it not been for her, we probably would have waited a further 60-90 minutes to get through security. As it was, we had another 45 minutes. It strikes me that if Manchester Airport Group management cannot recruit the staff in a timely fashion to manage people through security, given that people are travelling more now, then it needs to relinquish some of these slots to airports which do have the staff to manage people through them. My flight was one of numerous which was delayed by over an hour because of the delays at security. So, I’m sure commercially the airlines impacted can’t be happy with the damage it’s caused their brands either. Crucially too many people in an airport becomes a serious health and safety issue with various risk factors. An airport should not resemble a music venue or a sports stadium when the fans are leaving. I hope the Home Office is discussing with Manchester Airport Group what it is doing to reduce the chaos at security, as currently even pilots are describing Manchester Airport as a “joke of an airport”.",1
466,"Simply shocking in every respect. Security queues a disgrace as is the price of parking, food and drinks. Not a single positive thing I can say about this place - an airport to be avoided at all costs!",1
467,"So poorly run and organised, it’s actually a joke",1
468,"A shambolic joke. We were kept waiting on the plane for an hour after landing as they couldn't find anyone to put chocks under the wheels (Really? I mean, who'd have thought that a plane might turn up at an airport!) The misery was compounded when the same bunch of halfwits took over two hours to get the bags off the plane. In total it took us longer to pass through the airport than it did to fly from Italy. The best part of the experience was leaving the godforsaken place. Utterly dreadful, they don't deserve your custom.",1
469,"Absolutely terrible, cancellations, delays and chaos",1
470,"Shocking.  After arriving at the airport over 2 hours before flight scheduled, we queued for 1 hour to check our bags in.  Security was a shambles with huge queues.  With 15 minutes until our flight departure we were allowed to fast track but this didn't allow time for my random bag check at security.  We literally ran as fast as we could through the airport at high speed and only just got to the gate on time.  However, because the crew had also had to pass through this joke of a system, the flight slot was missed and we then had to sit on the runway for some time waiting for a new flight time.  Manchester come on you can do better than this.  Such a stressful start to a holiday",1
471,"All repeatedly poor if not terrible..very disappointing...run by people who should be doing something else because they can't run an airport..my experience over the past month from taking several flights in and out..long Security queues, unfriendly staff, long queues passport control, delays due to lack of bagage handlers, T3 scanners wldnt read my self printed boarding pass .worked ok in Portugal, queues for food, shops, toilets...things need to change here...if this is people's final memory of leaving Manchester it's is not a good one and not good for the North West.",1
472,"Had to give one star or else I could not write a review. The special assistance at this airport is an absolute disgrace. For the second time within a year I was left stranded at the luggage carousel with my husband in a wheelchair and two suitcases. Also, it is disgusting that airline crew are fast tracked leaving elderly people on crutches and in wheelchairs waiting. As my son advised, get a hotel near Liverpool airport and fly from there. Manchester Airport should be ashamed of themselves. All you are doing is stressing out disabled people with your lack of consideration",1
473,check in was chaotic and our bag failed to arrive but we weren’t notified. It came 30 h late but no explanation was given. Then we had to wait 90 mins at baggage reclaim on the way back. And what a dump!,1
474,"We arrived almost 3 hours before our flight because I had heard all the horror stories about Manchester airport. They are all true! It is utter chaos! We dropped our bags off and then queued at security for 1 hour and 40 minutes. There are very few staff and the ones who are there are rude and abusive to people.  The many signs on the wall tell passengers to treat their staff with respect, and they should, but it should work both ways. The airport shops and bars are empty because no one has time to stop and relax.  People were running to the gates! It was a very stressful start to a long awaited holiday.Come on Manchester, get your act together!",1
475,"Arrived well and early for my flight, the check in was normal, the airlines staff were friendly and quick. But then the problem started once we got to security check, over 300 people waiting in queue and few among them had their flight in 30 minutes but the airport staff only gave them priority 5 minutes before their flight. And for the rest of us it took over 1 hour 30 minutes. Not even all the counters/sections were open. Atleast assign extra help during peak times. By the time we got to the food area, every place started closing down at 7:30 pm. One of the two bars on the first floor told us 30 minutes waiting for drinks and a solid 1 hour for food. People eat in the airports cause in most cases it's better than airplane food. Even boots and WHSmith closed down after that which only gave us enough time to grab a bag of crisps, since the sandwiches were sold out. None of the airport staff or restaurant staff gave a reason why they were even closin early.",1
476,"As a frequent traveler across the globe I rate Manchester airport as the most dire of  any airport of a major city. It's not fit for purpose and I'm being generous with that comment. Flip a coin, you might catch ur flight and you might not it's a gamble these days.Let's just say poor is more than it deserves right now.",1
477,"I can think of nothing positive to say. Unbelievably inefficient security, massive queues, exorbitant parking/drop off charges,  no attempt to enforce mask wearing/social distancing. Avoid if you can.",1
478,"One star is too much for my experience yesterday.  I have NEVER, in all my 60 years of international travel to most parts of the world, EVER experienced such chaos in ANY terminal ANYWHERE.  Absence of check-in staff (we waited for an hour for someone to man the desk), huge (and I mean huge) queues even to access the security aisles, blockages to security lines, minimal staff and wheelchairs in Assisted Travel section for disabled some passengers  creating great distress and resulting in missed flights  .. even the special security lane alone for Assisted Travellers took 3/4 hour to clear.  For able passengers, security checks from the start of the queue (actually began outside the terminal because it was so long) to clearance was taking over 2 hours when I was there. I have no doubt many flights were missed. For parents with young children and for the elderly standing consistently in one queue or another is exhausting ... shops and coffee shops almost empty because most passengers were focused on actually getting to a gate on time.  The final insult for me was having to negotiate 6 flights of steps (no lift .. no assistance) to access the tarmac and then steps to the plane.  Most of the few beleaguered staff around were trying their best .. but some were just overwhelmed.  I witnessed the results of, perhaps, lack of funding but certainly an inadequate CEO and management team  totally unable to run one of our largest international airports effectively..  Arriving at Schipol with its space, cleanliness, light, ease of access, helpful fully staffed desks and gates served only to re-inforced my shame as a UK citizen Visitors to Britain passing through this airport will be left with a lasting impression of third world country chaos .   2022?  I don't think so ... and certainly not at Manchester Airport.",1
479,Utterly shocking from start to finish. Three hour wait to get through security outward. Held on the plane for almost an hour after landing due to lack of ground staff. Horrendous wait to get through passport control. All this led to us missing our train. And the final insult - during a pandemic - was ghosts world standards of cleanliness in the toilets. Disgusting!,1
480,"How on earth does this disgrace of an airport get 49% ratings as excellent ?  I’ve been travelling from Copenhagen to Manchester regularly over the past 15 years. Security staff in T1 with few exceptions are officious, nitpicking, and rude. I’m a Mancunian and I cringe when I see and hear how badly visitors are treated. Truly awful and it doesn’t look like changing any time soon. The management of this sorry mess really need to visit Copenhagen to see how it should be done.",1
481,"This must be the worst airport in the UK, Europe even! All they are interested in doing is extracting as much money from you as they can, from the moment you park to the minute you embark. Then, to boot, you get treated worse than cattle!Manchester Airport should never have been  allowed to get so big; it is totally out of control and the message seems to be, treat them like mushrooms- you know, keep them in the dark and drop them in the manure!2 hour queues to check in - similar on arrival.What we need is more smaller, regional airports not massive cash cows like Manchester Airport.I vow never to use it again, even if it means travelling way out of my area.",1
482,"Expect extremely long queue's and delays due to staff shortages. Took us 5 hours from the time we stepped into the airport to boarding. No ground staff so delays in getting luggage onto and off the planes. Had to sit on the plane for 1 hour with our luggage sitting on the tarmac because contractors could not decide which plane to service first. Due to terminal closures, expect long bus trips from the gates to the airplane. Cleaning shortages as loads of rubbish lying around i.e water bottles etc before security check in.",1
483,"This airport has lost the plot! I am a very frequent traveller and this hub is down with the worst in the world. - outward journey- T1 crammed, all seating taken (no space for “keep your distance” - Dirty, no maintenance just dreadful. Inbound- T3, (Sunday ) we were told to expect up to 3 hour wait for bags (longer than our flight) as they only had one baggage handling crew!!! As it was we collected after 2hrs05mins. - as customers we have choices, if I can avoid this disgraceful airport I will.",1
484,"My husband and I no longer use Manchester Airport as the queues at Security when we last passed through lastt year were very long.  There were only 2 security check desks available for non-fast-track travellers.  At that time masks were still required but we felt that Manchester Airport were doing nothing to safeguard passengers with long, busy, non-distanced queues and no sanctions for those not wearing masks.  Although there was an obvious lack of staff in the security area there seemed to be plenty in the money-making areas where food and goods sales occur.  Several weeks ago, having travelled thought Liverpool (2 security desks also available for far fewer travellers, with no real queues) we had a drink with friends who had travelled through Manchester.  They, who have safeguarded themselves carefully, complained they queued in security for well over an hour in crowded conditions, and very few people wearing masks, with various people with coughs and sneezes.  Although careful themselves, they contracted Covid, 99% certainly at Manchester Airport and then passed it on to us.  Well done to Manchester Airport for word-wide export of Covid through their total lack of passenger Covid safeguarding.  We have advised ALL our friends to use other airports if possible, and if they HAVE to use Manchester, to use Fast-track (but  this should not be obligatory just to stay Covid safe)",1
485,"AVOID THIS AIRPORT AT ANY COST!. It took my son over 2 hours to clear security yesterday (March 27), despite paying for the fast lane. 2 security lines working, only. There were so many people missing that flight had to be delayed so, luckily, he made the flight, but la d staff did not load the luggage, so now all luggage is missing. Other passengers in his group flying to other destinations missed their flights and the airport did not provide for any accomodations or cost reimbursement. An absolute shame. I RECOMMEND ANYONE READING THIS TO AVOID THIS AIRPORT",1
486,Arrived at 10:40 pm Sunday evening with heavy bags - NO baggage trollies in luggage hall.Staff appeared to consider this a minor inconvenience and paid little attention to the request so it was very tough to exit,1
487,Well over 2 hours to get through security. Absolutely ridiculous. Only 4 out of 10 security lanes running. Really need to hire more staff to sort out this sh** show. Because of this flight was very late setting off.,1
488,Terminal 1.One star is too high a rating. Most horrendous experience. Angry passengers and rude staff. Will never use again. Absolute disgrace. Get your act together,1
489,I only travel from Manchester airport if I’m going on a long haul.This airport is by far the worst. It involves queueing from the minute you go to check in. If you think this is bad wait whilst you go through security. This is chaotic under staffed and like a cattle market.On return after a ten and half hour flight. Yes again you have to queue for  hour and ten minutes to enter the country. Manchester airport being an international one. Needs to get its act together and employ some more staff. Or maybe look at other efficient international airports for some well needed tips and customer care,1
490,"Grim, dirty, out of touch with nowadays traveling standards, terminal 1 is looking like an airport in third world country, company that runs this airport obviously looks at the profit more then hiring new staff. Managers running this airport should travel first to see other airports how they are run as Manchester airport is absolutely disgusting and not International Airport.",1
491,Arrived at Manchester airport terminal 1 on Friday 25 March. The queue for passport control was dreadful. We had to queue for about 50 minutes to get through. One of the staff said it was because 13 flights had arrived at similar times. Well someone must know when planes are due to arrive to arrange staff rotas! Obviously management don’t care anymore. Manchester has to be the worst airport in the world. If I could use another airport I would every time. I notice terminal 3 is now closed so all flights have been crammed into two terminals. Terminal 1 looks like it’s going to close down too. Obviously very bad planning. Would not recommend.,1
492,"Parking rip off. Ground services slow and under staffed. Security checks slow and understaffed. So slow not worth buying lounge pass.A disgrace, and always has been very poor.",1
493,"Manchester Airport Parking - well, where do I start! Tried for five days to get in touch to make a change to my dates, left countless messages (they started that I am a “valued” customer, but never bothered to return calls) tried online to amend my booking but was left with zero options, tried to buy an additional two days to cover the extra parking needed, this worked out at nearly three time the price for my original booking - tried via their web page to email, leave feedback etc and the system would not accept anything - unworkable, frustrating, inadequate - avoid at all costs, easier to get a taxi to the airport, which is what I did in the end!",1

No walkways turned on. Never experienced such a poor service from an airport.,1

I checked my dashcam history only to realise that the entire footage from leaving home on our day of departure to picking the car up again had been  deleted.

504,"Had to give one star but if I could would give minus 5. What an absolute joke this airport is. Travelled  on 7 March 2022. Long queue to get through passport control, even longer through security took 2 hours hundreds of bags being taken off after scanning To be checked then if your flight was due you went to the front of the queue even if you had arrived 2 Hrs 30 mins before your flight which we did, so You finished up going backwards in the queue. By the time we got through security we had less than 5 mins to get to the boarding gate, followed by sitting on the plane for another 20 mins waiting for 2 passengers. Not enough staff NO organisation everyone rammed together waiting to go through security and announcement advising you to socially distance what a joke. International airport I say NO. Absolute shambles, disgrace of an airport, and do not get me started on the rip off car park charges. We travelled with Jet2holidays the staff where great no problem with our baggage on return as they unload baggage not Swissport who are the contractors for loading and unloading baggage who are also useless, as when we arrived back in Manchester a Tui flight had been waiting 90 mins in the arrivals hall for their baggage we waited 15 mins thanks Jet2holidays. Avoid Manchester Airport if you can.",1
505,"The worst international airport in the UK.Building is outdated with low ceilings.Security is especially grim, understaffed and takes far too long.Fast track is in name only.Absolutely diabolical experience, avoid at all costs.",1
506,"Probably the worst airport around at the minute, can't get in and can't get out, better to fly from somewhere else and travel an extra few hours, atleast then you won't miss your flight or be stuck on a plane for an extra few hours.",1
507,"First time using this airport dropping friends at Terminal one and what an unorganized shambles when exiting.The entry and drop was fine no problems.. The first 10 minutes is a cost of £5 whereas over 10 minutes you are charged the 24hr rate of £25 (money making racket) and have to pay at the barrier to exit.It's possible to easily enter and leave in 5 minutes but when driving round to the exit barriers is were you hit an issue.  Many drivers making payment by card in the machine is time consuming with entering details whis caused a queue.I was in a queue for 22 minutes and as I approached the barrier it displayed £25......  No way was I paying that fee especially when my overstay was being in a queue to leave the site.  I pressed button for help in which someone told me I have to pay the fee displayed. NO CHANCE!!!.... Was my reply to that.I told them I've switched my engine off and will sit there until the fee changed to £5, drivers in the other lanes were angry aswell with the process.Eventually they reset all the payment machines to £5 to allow us through but no doubt other drivers behind would have gone through the same farce.Come on Manchester airport sort your Money making ripoff process out and stop trying to bleed us dry......",1
508,"My cabin case was pulled aside at T2 security for a manual check because my empty insulin Novopen was in it.  I am type 1 diabetic and have been all my life. I have always carried a full pen in my liquids bag and a spare in my cabin case. The spare contains no insulin cartridge and no needle. These are carried separately and in my liquids bag which passed through the scanner in a different tray without any problem. When I pointed this out to the security agent who pulled the empty pen from the case waving it accusingly at me, she just said Well it needs checking anyway.  In no other airport has this ever happened. And this after witnessing two staff arguing about who’s idea it was to continue to channel people into the huge long queue on one side of the hall which moved at a snail’s pace when the queue on the other side (not fast track) was very short and anyone who managed to make their way into that queue got through security in no time. Please train your staff properly. It’s an utter shambles.",1
509,"Pretty shocking.Actually embarrassed that this is our international airport! It is embarrassing when foreigners arrive.Departure - terminal one was grotty, dirty and barely functioning. Shortage of staff. Long queues (beyond what is reasonably), lounges closed (a decision taken by the airport), lighting off in areas, outlets closed - facilities were not international standard.Arrivals - again not a particularly clean experience, border control were under staffed and generally miserable (likely because of their working conditions rather than anything else), luggage took over an hour to arrive on the belt… you have to pay for a trolley! What! How is this international service.Once you clear customs declarations - the area is shabby, outlets are part closed (during normal working hours) and the outer area to the car parks is a disgrace.Management - what is happening? How do we look on an international level when arrivals are greeted with this?If you can fly from another airport I would recommend it.",1
510,Arrived early 3pm for our 6pm flight 17/3/22 it took us 5 minutes to check our bags in and 10 minutes at security. No problems,4
511,"Huge queues, huddled into tiny spaces (gate 10 which is basically a pre fab set up). Lounges have similarly long lines, bathrooms are disgusting. Security diversions, very little signposting. And what's with the limited number of charging points and nowhere near chairs. So if you've got to charge your laptop or mobile, be prepared to stand (if there isn't already a queue for this)Hats off to the staff though. They're trying. But the space is too small for all these many flights. Been to a good few airports but this airport seems poorly thought out and in desperate need of an upgrade.",1
512,Flew out of Mcr Terminal 1 today security was atrocious 2.5 hours in the queue due to a lot of people arriving late...but if you were already in the airport you had to go back outside to join the queue...very few staff..toilets stink just a poor experience for a major international airport,2
513,"The baggage handling is a joke. Caused a four hour delay on the way out - missed our slot and sat on tarmac, and 2 hours on the way back (return flight delayed due to late take off on Manchester). Then another 1.5hrs at the carousel as no staff. Pathetic. No one accountable.",1
514,"It takes 2 hours to get through security. Many of the scanners are not being used. Also Manchester Airport rewards those coming late by fast tracking them in front of early arrivals. They said you could only be let into the airport security 20 minutes before you plane is due to leave. It takes 10 minutes through security. I am 74 and cannot run through the airport to the plane. Absolutely  no sympathy from security staff, it was as, that if you cannot run through the airport you shouldn't  be travelling. I am going back to Liverpool airport",1
515,I am a world traveller and absolutely dread having to use Manchester Airport on occasions. The security queues  are woefully bad. The security staff think they are in the third reich and nearly missed my flight yesterday due to two hours in security queue.I can confidently say that Manchester Airport is the worst customer service airport in the world.,1
516,"I don't really know what has happened to Manchester Airport,it used to be a great airport to travel from now it is the absolute pits, if you are travelling from the North West I suggest you try anywhere else other than Manchester, it has become without a doubt the worst airport to use for your travels",1
517,"My neices missed their flight back to Billund on 16th March due to huge queues to get through security. They kept being told their flight would wait, it didn't. The airport said it was due to unexpected numbers flying, they know how many will be flying, they just lie. If they spent as much money on queue reducing as they do on the huge car park charges they may get better reviews.  MAG hang your heads in shame. This keeps happening.",1
518,"I recently travelled from Manchester airport….horrendous experience,massive queue to check baggage in (2hours) then long delay at security.Just as we got through security we heard last call for our flight…we had to run miles to our gate to just catch our flight….we are dreading our next Holiday in May…wish we could fly from another airport but only Manchester go to our destination.Manchester airport needs to be investigated and put into special measures as it is not fit for purpose….shocking.",1
519,Absolutely disgusting Airport yesterday my daughters and their partners were flying back to Denmark waiting time 4hours and 20 minutes were assured they will get there flight ( 19.40) eventually got through security and the plane had left 5 minutes before 😡 Absolutely no help from either Ryanair or Airport staff. According too the News today people hat too wait for around 2-3 hours which was a total lie and couldn't cope with the volume of passengers due to staff shortages Absolute garbage they knew this beforehand the Airport can never cope with passengers its the worst Airport in the world Ryanair told my daughters they had to find accommodation themselves pay themselves and send the bill Absolute rubbish,1
520,Drop-off be warned you will be charged even though you are not dropping anyone off you have to follow the road round are you paying £10 and when I spoke to the operator he said I should’ve read the signs,1
521,"Never experienced anything like it, absolute mayhem, security for Terminal 1 queue for 300m on road outside airport. People panicking they would not make flights and little advice being provided. A complete car crash of an experience.",1
522,"First of all the positive.We used the Drop and Go airport parking service which was very good. Book online was easy. Drive to the car park, car gets scanned for any damage, leave in a designated spot, drop the keys off and jump on the free shuttle bus. Collection was just as easy. Only downside was poor signage around the airport.Now the negatives.Generally the signage was poor all around the airport.Organisation at the check in desks was non-existent, appreciate that this could have been the airlines fault, but with a quiet airport terminal it shold have been better organised.At the gates was where it go comical. Sat in a waiting area to hear three different messages being played over the tannoys at the same time was just an indication of how amateurish the airport was. Generally the communication systems were poor throughout.I hate to think how poor  Manchester will be when traveller numbers return to pre-pandemic levels as even with the low numbers it was a poor impression throughout.We picked Manchester due to the location, much closer to home. In the future would rather travel to Heathrow, have an overnight stay before a flight than go through Manchester again.",2
523,"The worst airport ever very dirty … bins on the floor , not enough seats and understaffed you got to be standing long hours because of not enough seats ppl sitting on the floor… avoid of all coast",1
524,"Absolute joke of a place,disorganised, queues are ridiculous, lack of staff  in all areas.",1
525,Minus 5 stars.Undertrained and consequently unorganised small minded personale who haven’t got a clue what they are doing. There is a 100% guarantee of waiting time. Hands down this has to be the worst airport security in the world and i say this as an otherwise proud Mancunian. I cannot believe that a company is getting paid for this shambles. Time and time again it lives up to reputation as the planets worst airport security. TipFly to London and hire a car or take the train.,1
526,"Our flight landed just before midnight, 90 minutes later the baggage started to arrive, the queue at passport control seem chaotic, and e gates a nightmare, sent to a referral gate that the queue was growing all the time, but was unmanned for a period. After normally flying from Manchester today was not a good experience at all, especially when Bucharest airport we seemed to land, everything went smoothly, and we were out with luggage shortly after landing. Much slicker than Manchester Airport! Not sure what's changed, but definitely not what it was! I feel Scottish airports maybe the way forward in future!",1
527,"Arrived well over 2 hours before a 6:10am flight to Chambery last Saturday planning to check in then have a leisurely breakfast airside.  A bit surprised when we arrived at the TUI check in Terminal 2 that it extended into a passageway from Terminal 1, dismayed to find that the queue was several hundred metres long and that it was obvious we would not be able to check in by the required time.  After 90 minutes and getting nowhere near the front of the queue a couple of extra check in desks were opened and passengers for imminent flights were called forward.  What followed was a sprint to security and then to the gate. No time for breakfast!  The plane take off was delayed until 7:30 due to not everyone being on board which led to losing take-off and landing slots.  The return flight fared little better, there was a 30 minutes wait after landing for the automatic guidance to the plane parking slot to be engaged and then comically for someone to find and apply rubber chocks to the wheels before the air bridge could be engaged! So nearly home, don't be silly! The baggage was not available on the carousel until 90 minutes after the plane had landed.  So overall a poor experience arising through an obvious lack of leadership and planning compounded by the fact that there has been ample opportunity to plan for the reopening of international travel following the easing of Covid restrictions.",1
528,"Appalling experience this morning - five hours after getting up at 4am on site, we were still on the tarmac.  Queueing several hundred yards on the skywalk outside Terminal 2, no check in desks open as the baggage system had failed.  When given our boarding cards, finally at the front of the queue, we had to go to a machine to weigh bags and print labels ourselves.  Try figuring out how to attach an airline label when your brain is not working….another long queue to get the bags on the couple of functional conveyor belts apparently for the whole terminal….Security a complete nightmare, another very lengthy queue, the usual removal of boots as expected but even my little wooly cardigan had to go in a tray.  Lucy and my hand luggage was taken for inspection but nothing unacceptable was found, don’t know what that was about.  Now half an hour to takeoff and no gate on the screen, but another flight with the same airline and destination was taking off at the same time from the C gates - adjacent to security, so we went there although no catering or duty free.   Our gate was displayed twenty minutes before takeoff - a B gate - last call was promptly announced, so we had to sprint back to security and out the other side, through duty free etcetera, a further significant distance, to find seated passengers and yet more waiting for a bus to the plane.  The plane took off nearly two hours late, as apparently our bags had been loaded on the flight which left from the C gate and vice versa.  The level of incompetence attaching to these organisations is unbelievable.  Driving out is infinitely preferable, even though it takes an extra couple of days on the wrong side of the road, possibly with snow chains up the mountain.  Anything but Manchester Airport",1
529,"Prepare for standing for hours or sitting on the floor. People are told now to arrive THREE HOURS earlier to avoid complete chaos, which is due to being seriously undestaffed. But there aren't enough seats for so many people. Especially as half of the cafés closed down, but they do not bother to open the seating areas in them for the public. No, there are forbidden seats in them,  kept away from the public by iron bars.",1
530,"Were to start. We recently flew from the new terminal 2.  If you fly from here be prepared for the same delays at security and walking. I mean walking for what appears to be miles. They are few information screens in the new areas  We were 1 hour later leaving as the computers were down and we were being made into sardines, oh wait sorry bussed out to the plane. Returning 10 days later, we only 30 minutes late off the plane;  the ground crew had forgot the planes wheel chocks.  Huh!!Then more miles of walking to the immigration area. Which though fully automated wasn't bad.  What was bad was as usually with manchester airport, the luggage took another 30 minutes to start coming through. Though this was better than last time which was a 60 minutes delay.Then another long trek to get to the car park pick up point. £6 just to pick some one up. Summary the new terminal is just a shop mall nothing more nothing less. This airport should spend more time getting the basics working, it's no use building new terminals if your customers think your really bad at what your meant to do . This joke of an airport must be a serious contender for worse UK airport.",1
531,DO NOT FLY from here. There are other airports you can choose. It’s absolute chaos. Zero management capability. Why are they letting the airport be run so horrifically. Waited over an hour to go through bag check. Literally losing the will as each person was given a lecture before they could go through. Food was A disgrace. 45 mins ware for food and 20 min wait for a drink. I mean seriously. I arrived nearly 3 hours early and barely got the plane on time. Will NEVER fly via Manchester again. After all these bad reviews I can’t believe they don’t care and aren’t doing anything.,1
532,"s the worst airport I have been to. Utter chaos going through the x-ray entrance. Going to the railway station NO escalators working for the past three years, no respect for the elderly and inform. Get back on a delayed flight and get a massive overcharge for parking. I'll go to liverpool or Leeds in future. Nowhere to sit whilst waiting for boarding, chaos as people struggle through queues in the isles.",1
533,"I like that I can get to the airport in 10 mins. I don’t like that the organisation of the airport is a total disgrace.  From the charges you have to pay for drop offs and pickups, to the absolutely chaotic organisation of check-in( took two hours) bag drop (skis- took 1 1/2 hrs in separate queue) last flight left two hours late.  On return from Austria  the plane landed three hours late as it was delayed taking off in Manchester at the start of the day! the bags took two and 1/2 hours to offload from plane.  Oh, and checked in bags on outward journey were loaded onto the wrong plane, FFS, what is going on!  Management needs to change as whoever is running this operation is beyond incompetent.",1
534,I echo previous comments regarding to snd from Gran Canaria. Arrived at 6am for 10.10. Flight. Queues were unbelievable yo get rid iv bags. System so confusing. Passed to security at 7.40. Queues again. Lines not working and staff having us queue at a line clearly not working and chiller. Eventually we moved ourselves and were through by 8.40. Absolutely ridiculous yo say they were unexpected numbers. These flights were booked well in advance. They knew how many to expect. Return was delayed because our plane was yet again nearly three hours late leaving Manchester. It’s put us off using this airport.,1
535,"We we're due to fly out at 10.10. Arrived at check-in at 07:00. We like to be early as we like to get something to eat before we fly. The queue for the TUI desks was about 50 metres down the tunnel connecting terminals 1 & 2. It took about an hour for us to get to check in. We then had issues with our Spanish entry forms. The TUI customer services agent was just useless. He basically just shouted at me and threatened that unless I sorted the form out, we wouldn't be flying. He also had reduced a young lady to tears who was having similar issues. Eventually someone else helped me and the error was sorted. We got through security and went to the designated gate. When we got there, there was no plane visible, despite it now being less that 30 minutes till we left. I decided to go back into the main building and see what was happening. They'd put the wrong gate number on the board. We all had to move to a different gate which was a decent walk away (15 minutes). Then there was nobody to operated the air bridge to allow the incoming people to get off. We eventally got onboard then waited about an hour for somebody to empty the toilet waste. We left over 3 hours late.Our flight home was also late because of issues at Manchester. We eventually left over 2 hours late. Arrived back only for the pilot to have to wait after leaving the runway because nobody had turned the lights on at the gate to direct him. Another 10 to 15 minutes delay. Add on another hour to get through immigration just to rub it in. The baggage collection area was littered with thousands upon thousands of cases which passengers had been unable to collect over the weekend. They were told that they would be forwarded to them, but that could take the best part of a week. In future if possible we'll look at flying from somewhere else. This airport has become a joke",1
536,"Absolute joke again at Manchester airport T1, security line for both A & B snaking around the terminal. Over and hour and a half wait! Just employ more staff, this is always the case and you know how many passengers are traveling or re open T3 to relieve the pressure!",1
537,"Currently sat at Manchester airport terminal 2 as flight delayed. Arrived for a TUI flight 3.25 hours before flight due. I have never seen such a long queue at checkin we were queuing past terminal 2. It took 90 minutes to check our luggage in followed by another 40 minutes to get through security. This airport is a joke, badly managed, lack of staff to assist customers, I dread to think what would happen if you required assistance. We will avoid this airport in future it’s not worth the hassle.",1
538,"Yet again, flight arrives bang on time at 00:05, still takes 25 minutes to get an airbridge and bags delivered 1h 20 mins after landing. No phone signal possible to rub salt in, so can’t even let people waiting know. Won’t do anything other than help attract business investment elsewhere this, management needs to learn quickly or get out of the way.",1
539,"Manchester airport is seriously BAD! I have flown into this airport three times in the past seven weeks and each time I had to wait more than an hour for my luggage. The airport put the blame on Swissport quoting staff shortages. I’m currently waiting for baggage having waited in the passport control queue for almost an hour as the e-gates are broken. Very, very bad airport.",1
540,"We flew from Manchester Airport this morning & I will never fly from there again  terminal 1 was utter chaos, staff are rude & extremely unhelpful, 4 of my party missed their flight because of the queues & lack of customer service. I am absolutely disgusted.",1
541,"Absolute joke, same as a few earlier, nobody to get the steps to the aircraft, then over a hour stood in the queue for passport control. My advice Book your holiday from another airport",1
542,Terrible going out and terrible coming back. They have spent millions on terminal 2 and only succeeded in making it worse! Going out on19 February there were 6 flights all at the same time and the queue took so long we had no time to get a drink or anything before the flight.Came back today - have to walk miles from plane to security and baggage and bags have still not arrived 40 minutes after landing.Other issues are rubbish restaurants with no service   Airport lounges full or not open and charging £5 just to drive and drop off and then another £5 to drive in and pick up.Shane on you for treating customers so badly,1
543,Shocking! Too squashed walking through security and insufficient seating in waiting areas and in restaurants. Less space on shops and more on seating please!,1
544,"Never again. We had an international flight on 14th Feb and it's as if the airport has never organised a flight before. Despite arriving 3 hours prior to departure, it took approximately 2 hours to check our bags in which was a self service anyway (loads of unmanned desks if they paid for staff) and then another long wait to get through security which was more chaos. We arrived at our gate with minutes to spare and then the flight was delayed by an hour and a half, including issues with the air bridge not being ready and ground handling issues. On our return, we had a while to wait for our domestic flight. The customer service at the Terminal 1 lounges (aspire and escape) were non existent. Aspire denied us point blank without even any justification and not even because they had reached full capacity - the lady was very rude. We were lucky to get into escape before they closed the doors to anyone who was not business or BA and again, everyone was horrified by the way the advisor spoke to them - maybe some training in manners is required. I'll never use Manchester again and everyone else was muttering the same. Seems to have a bad rep and now we've experienced it first hand.",1
545,Very disorganised systems Chaotic security delays paid for fasttrack but poor  machinery jamming caused delays Comical route to departure gate with poor signage Lack of catering facilitiesVery poor all way round,1
546,"On arrival we had a 45min queue for border control.  The staff were cheerful and polite telling us how to use the e-gate passport machines, but there are no posters or leaflets spelling it out. If you give better instructions you will speed things up.  And surely we can have machines that can be programmed to instantly read a passport. It shouldn’t take as long to read as it does. Whether this is the airports fault or Border Control’s fault is immaterial. If you can’t get the process quicker via machines you need to bring in humans to do it. People standing for 45 mins and without access to toilets  is outrageous and completely unacceptable. I will always use Liverpool airport if there is a choice.",1

Folks going up and down trying to see where they were to go. Return on 25th to usual chaos of immigration.  46min queues.  Big hall for queuing.  Why not invest in more auto gates.  Only 10 in the arrivals hall. Everyone blames everyone else.  Airlines blame airport management, airport blames border control.  Problem is they are all crap at this airport. Airport management need to get their act together and manage the facility and those they contract it to.",1

552,"Passenger Assistance prebooked and arranged. Made to walk from plane rather than the arranged wheelchair. Dumped in a basement for 45 minutes with the parting comment 'someone will come for you eventually, well hopefully'.

Have used Assistance at many airports. Manchester has always failed to deliver good service. They need to employ more staff to deliver the service effectively. Will not be travelling from there again by choice. Try East Midlands their service is great!",1

555,"By far the worst airport I have ever transited through. We had to walk from terminal 2 to terminal 1 which took almost 30 minutes. None of the moving walkways were operable. Then we had to go through security which took me an hour. They kept my bag for a physical search which took 40 minutes, because they were taking pretty much everyone’s bag for a search. One person staffing and very nasty and rude. People were complaining they will miss their connecting flight. Their only response was go talk to the manager. A fight almost broke out between a passenger and security personnel because of their uncaring demeanor. They pulled my bag because I had a stick of deodorant that I didn’t take out. No one told me I had to take out my deodorant. When I went through security at JFK this wasn’t even an issue. They should inform passengers that they want things done a certain way. Then I went to my gate which they changed the last minute. All in all a totally disfunctional airport. I’ve been through airports in third world countries with much more passenger volume which were more organized and passenger friendly than Manchester. Never will I ever fly into Manchester again.",1
556,This is undoubtedly the worst airport ever…Will never fly from there again…Delayed going out…luggage breaking down…no staff…But guess what….they won’t give a ‘TOSS’…Neither will SWISSPORT…Waited an hour for someone to turn up to operate airbridge…An hour through passport control & an hour & a half for the luggage to appear….TUI…& other holiday companies...be WARNED in an Industry that is starting to come alive…This WILL EFFECT peoples decisions to fly with YOU!!!No one there to talk to…baggage all over the place…3rd world airports run better than this ‘HOLE’…To top it off…luggage damaged…EVERYONE…STAY AWAY FROM THIS AIRPORT!!!!🤬,1

When we joined the queue we looked at purchasing fast track security tickets but they were not available. When we were starting to panic about our flight, some nice passengers let us in front of them and by the time we got to the front our gate closed in 5 mins. We asked the security guy (in lane 2) if he could help us, he told us he didn’t care. Zero customer service skills and zero compassion. The guy at the other end of lane 2 and the guy on body scans was very helpful and apologetic. This was worst security experience ever and will make me think twice about ever using this airport again. We were certainly not the only people in this position",1

562,Quite simply the worst airport you could possibly have to go to. Awful queues. Understaffed. Poorly designed. Insane parking charges. As a Mancunian it almost makes me want to drive to Liverpool.,1
563,Parking to collect is too much . 20 pound is what i pay for just over a hour  . When i leave the car for a week it's around 50 pound .. feels a rip off,1
564,"Absolute rip-off, they charge more than Heathrow parking tariffs. £12 for 30 mins, £20 for 60 mins, £5 for 300 seconds drop off !!! £1 for trolleys !!! should be embarrassed compared to other int. airports, sick and poor paying these each time visiting the airport, no real alterative available ! MAG are outright money grabbers ! as if airport taxes are not enough !",1
565,"After a bad experience in 2016, I vowed never to use Manchester Airport again. I recently broke that promise to myself and did I regret it!The most chaotic shambles of an airport. Rude unhelpful staff who haven’t got a clue what they’re doing. Always massive queues everywhere and minimal information. Covid regulations have made it even worse. Security should be singled out as the worst of the lot. Rude, patronising staff who don’t even know how to do their job properly. I nearly missed my flight last time after an incredibly stressful experience. I remember years ago this was a good airport but not any longer. I’ll be flying from Leeds in future.",1
566,Had to wait for one and a half hours for our baggage after an overnight flight from Jamaica on the 11th February.  Bags were filthy.,1
567,Drop and go. Originally the organisation was fantastic. Directions spot on. Someone to tell us where to park. Clean undercover car park. Polite staff. Someone to tell us how to drop off the key and keep the receipt with the bar code on it. But the return bus driver “ Brian” (apparently )was so rude to the point of being violent. He actually got out of his seat to shout at people and threw our cases around. Complete nut job. Shouldn’t be allowed to work with public. Oh and make sure you book it correctly. I miss typed a date. No bother it says on the site. You get a refund if you need to change. Still waiting for that.  No replies to emails.,1
568,Flying out from Manchester with Tui in February we. Queued for over an hour to self check in with 2 members of staff for hundreds of passengers. Plane then stood on the stand with everyone on board for 45 minutes. Shortage of baggage handlers was apparently to blame. On our return the shambles was repeated - an hour and a half wait for luggage. If you can avoid flying from Manchester you should do so!,1
569,"The worst experience I’ve ever had in one airport. I was just doing a connection flight but I had to leave the airport and get back in…. NO OFFICERS at  migration point, we had to wait to be attended. TCA CONTROL.. I mean, I had to put everything  (liquids, cream, makeup ) into a plastic bag that the personal gave me although I had my stuff in another plastic bag. They told to put everything in one bag and the rest that didn’t fit in the TRASH. Honestly the worst experience, they won’t even let me touch my stuff . Officers and people who work there did not were wearing masks. TRASH EVERYWHERE, and just 20min before the close gate they give us a departure gate. So many worst experience but I thing this was the very worst and annoying. Definitely not getting other connection or arrival a this airport EVER.",1
570,"Sorry cannot give no stars, just picked up my son from T2 pick up. Charged £6.00!!How do you Manchester Airport justify this rip off price. Is it because you know you have a captive audience you want to fleece us for what you can get?I was a weekly frequent business flyer from Manchester airport pre-pandemic. I have not missed and now resenting having to fly again from this over priced under performing airport. Your only redeeming feature is your locality to my house.All the European airports I travel to and from do not charge for drop off and pick-up and deliver superior service in comparison.",1
571,"Arrived at Manchester Airport firstly to find the 'drop off' charges are now £5 - was £3 last year! Check in with Jet 2 was good - then Security - ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE! The queue 's stretched practically all around the airport in a big ""S"" shape, people had to be rushed through for flights due to leave soon, must have spent between 1 and 2 hours standing in this queue. The airport only had T1 & T2 terminals in use and didn't have the staff to cope with just those two!Disgusting service?!!!!",1
572,"On depreture we were in a humungous queue to get through baggage check, which was made worse by people in the 'fast track' queue being diverted to the front of our belt two at a time, which was in addition to using their own belt, so out of every 12 people trying to process bags 8 of them were from 'fast track', which was very poor management and not customer focused at all and caused a lot of unrest in the main queue. On arrival back in Manchester we had to sit on the tarmac for 30 mins while a bridge was sorted to unload the plane, which was seriously unprofessional.  Then after going through passport control we spent another 50 minutes waiting for our luggage, not great and better service at 3rd world airports.This airport has liost the plot, it really needs a change of management to one that is more customer focused/driven, it seems to get worse every time we use it.  Next time I'll try Liverpool, it can't possibly be any worse.",1
573,"Terrible, shameless, money grabbing, unprofessional airport. As someone who lives in Manchester it is embarrassing. The council (s) own it and it has been a good money generator in better times, but they need to remember people can go elsewhere. I would advice anyone to do that and avoid it if they can.On arrival the plane had to wait 45 minutes for a gate. Then over an hour for luggage at a very quiet airport. But that's not my moan. You have to pay (and it's non-refundable) for baggage trolley. People were paying but the systems were faulty and they weren't getting their trolley. Staff were hard to come by, and weren't particularly bothered, all you could get out of them, and I quote 'I know, it's s**t'.Its not much when you consider all the airport taxes, cost of dropping off (even for a few minutes), extortionate costs for pickup parking, to just provide free baggage trolleys. But if you are going to be greedy and charge, make sure the machines work.",1
574,"Just arrived last night at Manchester airport. Is it a joke or do they really not have any baggage handling staff. We were the only plane in and there was a mess of bags in the reclaimation area from a previous flight. Complete neglegence. Broken airbridge , slow steps to arrive, no baggage for over an hour and a half when we were the only plane arrival. What a complete shambles. How can the management accept such shoddy service after so much hype. Seriously a five year old could organise things better. On one good point Border secuity team were great help and we would still be waiting but for them. It is the time for Manchester mayor to step in and sort this out as it is damaging the image of the city.",1
575,"Just been to pick customers up. Landed at 01:38, finally collected their luggage at 03:20. The excuse was that the baggage handlers were loading a plane that was due to take off. What a lie, the next plane was due to take off at 05:55.",1
576,We have just returned from a lovely holiday in Tenerife. Totally spoiled by having to wait over an hour to get our luggage. Our flight landed at 0.48 and it is 2.20 and still no bags . To make it worse there is nobody at all to talk to in the airport . We have tried to talk to someone who refused to talk … the only thing he said was “I am not talking to you I have had the sh.y all day “ Charming! It really is poor !,1
577,"The worst of the worst.There is so much wrong with this Airport. The signage is misleading and confusing, the staff lack focus and professionalism. Many spend time gossiping to their colleagues and use their own phones as they wish. The security check area is truly shocking. The majority of bags being x rayed are rerouted for additional checks It took me an hour and a half  to get through. I would suggest more signage informing people to put liquids in clear bags. Every bag that was rechecked had liquids inside. No one seems too worried about this. Staff were like headless chickens calling everyone “sweetheart and Darling “ while repacking liquids for each bag which slowed everything to a crawl. In other airports  very little bags are selected for additional screening so lessons need to be learned and travellers educated as to what they need to do prior to their flight.Managment need to visit other airports and see how it should be done.",1
578,Worst airport ever. I travel a lot and smaller 3rd world countries operate a more efficient service by far. Unnecessary long queues. The few staff working seem to overworked and underpaid as their customer service skills are terrible. Never see a manager despite chaos. It really feels as the passengers are an inconvenience. Hate flying from there.,1
579,"I've never been to such a poorly run Airport, crammed and huge check in queues, a security system that's like a cattle market. The only adequate space is a huge and unnecessary duty free. I've been to far better airports in the so called Third World. I guess that's what the UK is now.",1
580,"Gosh, the airport is big now!Sleepy, post pandemic Airport with only 9 departures on the board. Still terminal 2 seemed very busy. Its gonna be unpleasantly busy when back to normal.Clean, despite everyone trying to mess it up. Walked about 5 miles for various reasons, which got my steps up for the day. Travelators were switched off due to low passenger numbers. Star lost due to slow security (despite low numbers) and posting wrong gate 1 mile away from the genuine gate. Seriously! Security laid an egg seeing 200 people marching the wrong way away from the gates,",4
581,Security staff . Absolutely disgustingly rude. Because I had miss heard an instruction. I was spoken to in the most rude way.,1
582,Worst airport I have ever experienced! Longest que before even getting into security then only 3 securities opened! No one cares! You might as well turn up late and jump the que. I have been waiting over 2 hours to go through security. Absolute joke…what a nightmare!!!,1
583,It is a joke of an airport. To get through security takes over an hour. Using only 4 of 8 security belts. People begging to let their bag skip the line so they can make their flight. Staff in no rush at all. Love a wonder off while customers are begging to get through.,1
584,What a truly awful place Manchester Airport is - from start to finish unnecessary queues and non-existent customer service. Bag check alone took over 45 minutes and it wasn’t even busy. Staff couldn’t care less despite people actually crying as they were going to miss flights. Don’t think there is any management - if there is they’re either hiding in shame or some serious capability checks need to be put in place! I have never passed through a worse airport anywhere in the world. Shameful. If you have any choice AVOID!,1
585,Waited 30 minutes for courtesy bus to drop and go on 30 Jan 22.  Eventually a car rental return bus was persuaded to take us. Bus then dangerously overcrowded.  Drop and Go not worth the £30 saving over the standard over-priced car park.  Terrible airport.,1
586,"Everytime we travel from Manchester Airport I decide to never use the airport again. However the choice of flights keeps me booking again. From start to finish it is always a dreadful experience.  Having travelled throughout Europe using much smaller airports with less resource the inability of Manchester to provide a good customer experience never ceases to amaze me. The barriers at the car park.. broken. Security, predictably rude. Shops large, yes, and still a poor selection of products.  Bar .. operating a order from your phone system that is utterly useless. Notices for departure gates that send you to gate 30 rather than gate 3D. All in all a predictable bad experience, yet again.",1
587,"Very poor customer experience overall which continues to be blamed on the pandemic. Terminal 1 is dire, with barely enough seating. Security is slow, and always seems to have a high number of additional luggage checks compared to other airports I use. I travel routinely to Ireland and the ground crew almost never apply the purchasable addon's offered by the airline (priority boarding etc). On arrival back into T1, it is always necessary to take a bus transfer to arrivals which is irksome. Car parking is extremely expensive, car parks are dark and signage isn't great. With T3 showing no signs of opening soon, the summer looks set to be a grim experience for travellers.",3
588,"I recently went to Pakistan and had to travel vis Manchester airport, it was a pleasant experience overall.",4
589,"Avoid the meet and greet. I paid almost £100 to park my car for a week with meet and greet as my flight was really early.  When I collected my car is was clear that some one had used it, quarter of the tank had been used, the inside had be ransacked, the middle arm rest which I leave in the up right position was down and the contents on the floor.  I do not smoke in my car , but they did, as a white residue was in the ashtray.  To top it all off, they scratched the paintwork on the left hand side of the car.  I sent in a complaint and an automatic response said they had my email and will get back to me in 10 working days.  I wrote  to then on the 31st of Dec 21, its the 13th of Jan 22 and I have not heard back from them. I felt violated!!! Now I have to chase them to get them to pay for the body work damage and a valet.  YOUR CAR IS NOT SAFE WITH MEET AND GREET MANCHESTER TERMINAL 1. It will be used and abused. If only I could upload photos I would love to share them. UPDATE They got back to me and said read the terms and conditions. Basically they are accepting 0 liability.",1
590,"From the moment you start getting near to the Airport by car you start to see the dis-organisation of the place. Which terminal, which lane, traffic coming from all directions its absolutely awful.Terminal 2 once inside the check in area is huge which is good but unnecessary. Security we paid for extra for fast track which was actually slower, people going through the normal route came out long before us.Then into the shopping area where your forced through a route of duty free which isn't a direct route you double back on yourself once the other side. Something you don't need early hours of the morning after 1.5hr drive.Then there's the food hall just not geared up or big enough for the numbers, long que's everywhere, stressed people trying to get food and drink and this during the Pandemic. Dread to think what it would be like in school holidays. It just can't cope with the numbers even though it's just had a major refurb. Boarding, some of the gates are a 10min walk according to the directions, mine was only 5.All in all not a pleasurable experience at all, the whole place is poorly designed for the numbers its suppossed to deal with. Its a completely stressful place.Liverpool much better if you can get a flight to where you need to go.",1
591,"Worst Airport in the world...BA flight heathrow to manchester airport landed 7.25pm at manchester terminal 3 which is closed, had to walk down 3 flights of stairs and on to the luggage collection which is in an area in terminal 3 , I CANNOT BELEIVE THAT CUSTOMERS ARE MADE TO EXIT THE AIRCRAFT AND WAIT IN TEMPERATURES OF JUST 1C INSIDE THIS TERMINAL BUILDING FREEZING COLD  for their luggage for 30 - 59 minutes, there is no heating what so ever old and young people where shivering it is an absolute disgrace, i have been to airports all over the world and never experienced such a sham of an airport., AND THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON NOW IN THIS TERMINAL FOR OVER 5 YEARS WHAT A DISGRACE! THEN TOLD TO WALK TO TERMINAL 1  FOR PICK UP, ! SORT YOUR AIRPORT OUT OLD AND YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING.",1
592,"Manchester airport was totally let down by the queuing system at passport control in arrivals. The way the queues are managed meant that social distancing was not possible by those that wanted to do it. It was like being in a cattle shed. After the constant care we had taken to keep ourselves and others safe going abroad, this was completely undone by the thoughtless process at Manchester. And as for the passenger locator form that we spent a day sorting out (long story and not MCR airports fault) no one even looked at them or checked we had one!! Absolute joke",1
593,£20 for 2 hours short stay parking to pick my mum up from the airport.  Good Lord!  You even have to pay to drop off too.  What next - paying to breath the air??  What a poor excuse for an airport.,1
594,"Manchester Airport is an embarrassment to the UK, it's horrendous,  incompetent service is well below it's international competitors.  The place looks run down, it's expensive and they treat their customers like cash cows  milking them for every penny at any opportunity whilst providing a substandard service. Let's not forget the 3 HOUR SECURITY WAITS.  WHAT A DISGRACE AND EMBARRASSMENT TO THIS NATION YOU ARE MAN!!",1
595,"Worst airport in the UKLive within 30 minutes of Manchester airport but we have vowed to never travel from there again if there is an alternative They have made it impossible for drop off and pick upYou can walk 10 minutes to the gate now, making it difficult for those with even minimal mobility issuesSecurity is a joke, I’ve been told the security manager has a remit to get people through security quickly so they spend money, on our last 4 trips we haven’t even had time for breakfast.You are held at the gates for hoursSecurity siphon off as many bags as they allow through and then there’s one man at a snails pace checking them, mine went through but there were many complaints Our last trip even the Captain complained when we got on the aircraft stating he always works out of Birmingham and Gatwick and Manchester was the worst he had encountered ever and he was writing a reportWe have been from London airports, Leeds, Liverpool and Glasgow, all with good experiences",1
596,"Was just through airport with my baby never had a better experience they said come through priority security so baby wasn’t stood in a queue with covid around, my wife has a insulin pump and all staff were trained knowing what scanners they can go through very impressed",5
597,Flew out from here on 19 December for what was supposed to be a 10:10 departure with TUI to Montego Bay. They may have a lovely shiny looking airport but the ques at check in and security are woeful. TUI had only 4 desks open but we were through this at a decent time. Security was the BIG let down. Only half of the available security checking area was open. The  staff working that day tried to keep us all moving but were over whelmed by the volume of passengers leading to over an hour to clear this. Our plane was on a remote stand meaning we all had to transfer by bus out to a cold foggy area away from the main terminal. The plane took off over 2 and 1/2 hours late ruening the first evening of our holiday as by the time we reached our resort hotel we were totally exhausted arriving 9pm Jamaican time 5 hrs behind UK so felt like 1am to us. The delay was due to a baggage issue at Manchester.Our return flight home to Manchester was late arriving again due to a baggage issue at Manchester.. After landing at Manchester on 31st at 7am  after a reasonable short que  at Security we then waited nearly 45 mins for our baggage to be unloaded and sent to the reclaim belt.  The car park didnt recognise my car registration  upon entering the multi storey car park and I pressed what I thought to be a help button  and barrier raised after a token popped out. In fact the help button is a tiny one in the top right of the panel not well marked out. You wont find anyone to talk to unless you go back to the barrier and look again and see the help button. Having explained what I done got a abrupt reply of you should not have done that . Was told to explain the situation upon my return. However when I done it on my return an very arsey lady again moaning that I should not have done that. Wont be using this airport anytime again soon.,2
598,"Worst airport I’ve ever been to, such a shame but having no credible alternative international airport in the North we have to put up with it. Man airport always been a stressful experience with long queues but since they made a load of staff redundant it’s beyond poor. You’d think this was a new business our check in took 2.5 hours at the Etihad desk where they’d only been allocated 4 desks. Then massive fast track queue took 45 mins as the new terminal  security belts broke. No time to buy food for our 9 hour flight or purchase any last minute items. It had little to do with pandemic it’s always been terrible, granted illness will have taken its role but they know how many passengers are coming in advance. The new terminal is dreadful it takes forever to walk to the gates, the electronic walk ways were broken, there was no heating only a few vending machines if you wanted a drink. The airport have made a lot of redundancies and do not treat their staff well with only adds to the overall environment. The staff we spoke to hated working there. Many of the ground crew have been let go. Airlines should go to John Lennon and let Manchester Airport rot.",1
599,"Awful, staff are terrible, rude, unhelpful, slow. Whole process is poorly run. Never again!",1
600,"Management should be ashamed and don’t you dare blame Covid. It was bad before Covid and all the pandemic has done is prove this airport needs a management restructuring.Staff not wearing masks. Passengers not wearing masks and no enforcement. Right now it is law to wear a mask in an airport.Passengers hauling bags to and fro between security A and B. Check in at Security B, now go back to Security A, where you first came in. Terrible signage. Security screening is a farce. This is where you are likely to miss your flight. Fast Track isn’t worth it. It is a queue to just one security screen that is under staffed. It is actually slower than the rest. Move between terminals. Travelators not working and haven’t been for TWO YEARS.Not enough seating. No water unless you buy it. This is a city with some of the best tap water in the world and they make you buy it.I am a seasoned world wide traveler and this is the worst airport I have been in. I’m also a Mancunian and this airport is a disgrace to our city.",1
601,"Had bad experience at terminal 1 car park. They don't issue tickets at the entrance and if you don't check the exact time then you could pay a lot more,I have been parking for 2 hours to help my wife and daughter to check in, didn't check the exact entry time but I assumed I had to pay on the way back so I was looking to see where I have to pay as it used to be paying machine around the car park and then you had 10 minutes to leave but now you have to pay when you leave the car park at the barrier so as I was waiting for other cars to park and clear the area I got stuck and by the time I got to the barrier it was over 2 hours and had to pay £30 ! Which I call robbery. Could someone please tell me why they have not rip people of like this? Even we can't drop someone off before paying £5 to £10. Every passenger who use the airport is paying a tax , should that not be enough! And why the same car park will cost half the price if we book it in advance!? As if you know how long exactly you will be waiting to pick your loved one up! I wish government could stop these greedy people.",1
602,"We are traveling to Mexico and had to fill in a health questionnaire on line 12 hours before departing. We could not do this as Manchester Airport is not on the drop down list and cannot be overwritten. At checking in, we were told that it had to be done and to put departure airport as London Heathrow. Why are we being told to lie? Also we spent all night stressing over this. Get your house in order Manchester.",2
603,"I have travelled through many airports over a number of years, and Manchester is by far the worst managed I have ever had the misfortune to travel from and to. It has consistently been understaffed and the queues are always horrendous. As this has happened often over a number of years, I can only assume that the management of the airport couldn't care less about the passengers.",1
604,"If I could score 0 I would. 1B spent! What a joke. On departure day delay up to 2.5 hrs before security check. Some brain dead’s with several Tesco bags , others with liquids, overall painful & late checking. On arrival, wheelchair booked never arrived, no one available!! Shocking as third world countries better service . To make it perfect , luggage arrived 1.5 hour after landing . I will not bother traveling from this joke of the terminal",1
605,What an awful airport!!! Definitely the worst in UK and also poor in comparison to other over the world. It's so hard to get your way around it due to poor signs. The security is madness with very bad queue management and lack of good practice. Staff is rude and the whole experience not pleasant at all. Better try to avoid this airport if only possible!!!,1

607,"Looks really nice and modern but Complete disorganised chaos. Not enough staff, poor signs,  huge queues everywhere but using very little of the equipment. 3 hours to drop bags off and get through security even though we had checked in online in advance.

608,"Travelled out to Lanzarote 10 days ago, the worst part of the experience is (as ever) Manchester  Airport. Covid rules completely ignored & not enforced.

I honestly don’t know how this airport gets away with it 🤬🤬",1

610,Just a message to the management...when are you going to get your shoot together?  If you can't do your job just leave.... You're making Manchester airport the worst in the world...shame on you....you should be all kicked out,1
611,17.12.21- we all stood in the security for nearly 2hrs! It is not possible to adhere to any Covid Regulations as 100s of passengers were in line. Only 4 security lines were open for the general passengers and 3 for fast track. A disgrace to be held in this hall for so long! Covid is probably now being transmitted everywhere! Why cant they all be manned to move people through quicker?,1
612,Security wot a mess 2 hrs in line 3bays out of ten working bag got rejected for 2 sprays bag emptied but they failed to put back passport now 5 minutes to gate closed inevitably missed flight passport later found in Security very rude uncaring jobsworth staff then took me 3hrs to get out of airport no one willing to help worst day of my life if i did my job as bad as Manchester airport Security staff i would be sacked on the spot i will never fly from that airport again,1

614,Picked up passengers on the 9th December at 1930. The airport access road was gridlocked and queuing to access the Terminal 1 pick up area. No staff direction traffic and this needs to be investigated by the Health & Safety Executive as the whole area is dangerous. This airport has outgrown its infrastructure and doesn’t really care about the passenger experience.,1

In the airport, they acknowledge this was the airports fault, 40+ others also missed the flight, and I was advised to re-book a flight to my destination and I’d be refunded in 3-5 days.

621,We missed our flight We arrived early at the airport and waited in long queues for self checkin. When we were first in line the announcer requested that passengers on my flight who are not at the front of the line should go to a certain desk. The lady at the self checkin didn’t let us checkin even though the announcer said if you were not at the front of the queue. We went to the desk and this time we were last in another long queue. We waited patiently and when it was our turn we were told that we wouldn’t be able to fly because of a locator form that the airline requires to have printed out (we knew nothing about it and other passengers had the same problem) None of the staff were any use at all. NONE of the printers at the airport worked!! And we and other passengers missed that flight,1

Massively reduced waiting area and there is NOWHERE for people to sit apart from a pret a manger where you are expected to make a purchase of course.  Whoever thought of this modification deserves a slow clap!,1
626,Terminal 1 you are an absolute disgrace .You are absolutely filthy.You Herd your Customer / Clients through Security like cattle.Your staff just shout.Your trays you expect us to put our belonging are absolutely embarrassingly minging.Most business during the pandemic lockdown have taken the opportunity to deep clean and re decorated to keep their customer/clients safe….not Manchester Airport.You are likely to catch something passing through Terminal 1 Security you are a breeding ground for germs. The place is disorganised chaos and not a great experience.Any other type of business would have had to close their doors with standards this low.Think you need to get your act together Manchester Airport and show your loyal customers that you appreciate their business.We live in the 21st Century but the standard of service at Terminal 1 is far from what expected.If I could have given 0 Star rating that’s what I would have done.,1
627,"Parked up in the mid stay carpark, could do with some signs from the motorway to help you find it! I have to say I hate terminal 1, it’s a mess, cramp and just disorganised. Security is awful there’s hardly any room to move, you queue up against a wall and feel like your in a portacabin, the staff spend all their time shouting at you or shouting as your moving through security! Every time I visit terminal 1 security I found it more and more stressful! There is no need to shout at folk we are not thick! Then you get to the terminal itself, busy and no seating and cost a bomb to buy anything in any of the shops! Manchester is one of the most popular airports in the uk! Get it sorted and up to date!",1
628,"I have been to many airports in my time but never have I experienced such chaos as I have today at terminal one.  I was an hour and twenty minutes cueing and then a further 20 minutes for my bag to finally get checked literally with 10 minutes to spare to catch my flight, staff were rude and unhelpful, never again!!! I am also suffering with degenerative disc disease and cannot stand for long without being in excruciating pain. A complete nightmare.",1
629,"The worst experience ever. None of the staff knew what they’re doing - jumping people to and from queue’s, making our line longer for no reason! They have no idea what they’re doing, do the even have any in house training on how to run an airport. 3 hours just to check us in!! Our flights in 20 mins and we haven’t been scanned in yet. Total joke! Avoid this airport at all cost!!",1
630,"Security at this airport is akin to a stalag. The staff are unfriendly, unhelpful, overly zealous. Every time we use this airport our bag gets sidelined for checks. Often they mistakenly saw something. Today I was frisked because the seam on my trousers looked odd. One man complained too much and they refused him to fly. What a hell hole.",1
631,"What an awful disgrace of an airport! We've been to many airports around the world but this really is the worst. Flying in November, T3 not open so all flights out of T1 and T2. We flew from T1. Far too overcrowded, zero social distancing, people not bothering with masks, no enforcement, queues everywhere, it's a shambles.Not maintained and badly kept. We flew from Stansted in September and that was far better, you can definitely tell the difference between South and North!!! Clearly keeping T3 shut is designed to save money but to the expense of passenger comfort and safety. This airport practices should be looked into. Horrible.",1
632,"Whilst on holiday I had a bad fall badly injuring my ankle and right shoulder and I needed wheel chair assistance. The departure airport was excellent in their care. Manchester airport dreadful, passengers needing assistance were abandoned in chairs with wheels on them, waited ages for an attendant to take disabled passengers through passport controls, baggage claim and customs. Only one member of staff arrived to service two passengers in chairs with wheels on them. Informing us that they could not go through customs as they would not be able to return into the secure area.  (To be able to work airside you have to have an airside pass). Eventually, to go through customs I had no other option but to snuggle out of the chair with wheels on and virtually crawled through into the arrivals hall pushing my bag.  As a result I sustained additional injuries to my arm.  I am 81 years old and this is by far the worst experience I have ever had at any airport.  A letter went off to Charlie Cornish, Group Chief Executive, with copies to Ken O’Tool FCE and Michelle Baxter ABM Industries the company responsible for assisting disabled passengers.  I received an email from Smithesh the Customer Feedback Manager for Manchester airport group who was sorry to hear of my experience giving me a Ref:00343218-Special assistance service not provided.  I was informed that I could expect a reply with a full response within seven days.  Despite me contacting Smithesh again no such communication has been received.  It is astonishing the lack of care and concern that this airports thinks it can get away with.",1
633,"T1: Poor standard airport.When departing from airport T1 the food outlets were already closing by 6pm! Plenty of flights were leaving in the evening, plenty of people around, so why they need to close eateries at tea time!? Pathetic. Had to settle for a Burger King! Where there’s hardly any tables and the cleanliness is just scruffy. People were having to help themselves to closed cafe tables ….. of which weren’t obviously cleaned between each customer … terrible when their is a health pandemic currently.When arriving back, it took the ground staff 15 minutes to attach the rear staircase to the plane! Back and forth it went. Ridiculous, especially when you’ve not got time to waste when you’re now having to rush for the very infrequent evening train service back over the Pennines on the Transpenine train. (I.e. 2 hour frequency). … is this the same down South at Heathrow Airport? Doubt it very much! They have the underground.The terminal building itself is poor standard. Felt like a metal portakabin. When entering the building from the tarmac you have to go through a narrow corridor, then you have to go up stairs, which is not ideal when there are people with mobility issues, and children who are tired on their feet. Other international standard airports would have an escalator or lift at least. You have to walk through long, narrow and windy corridors to the passport boarder control - so the area is very crowded. No room for people to quickly pass by (or even social distance). Then when you get to border control if you have an electronic passport they make you use them, and the machines that Manchester have are very hit and miss, it’s about time they upgraded them, because there were plenty of passports being rejected and having to see a staff member in the end. It just wastes people’s time. Couldn’t find a water fountain in terminal 1 or the Station - and that is just a basic requirement.  Then if you want to go from terminal 1 to the train Station, the flat escalators have been broken for years!!!!!!!! It seems that there is money to upgrade somethings (like Terminal 2), but then other terminals are just abandoned. Manchester need to seriously up their game, as this terminal just looks poor and stuck in the 90s. And not really accessible friendly. Manchester needs to look at Copenhagen, Schipol (Amsterdam) or Spanish airports, just to see how other international countries do it better!!",1
634,"Special assistance  staff T 2 on the 31st October. A huge thank you to all the staff at T2 special assistance who went above and beyond to help us get the right test for an elderly family member  who would be travelling alone.They also had to call a paramedic as another urgent situation materialized with a family member.Who subsequently was taken to hospital. Great,caring,discreet team a massive thank you to you all.",5
635,"We flew back from Spain today ams arrived around 13.15. While its true that the airport is extremely over priced - I can deal with that. However, what disgusted me was the way in which the staff at border control were treating people. There were two men, one who told you which lane to go in and one that ‘helped’ you at the automated passport machines. Neither of these men were helpful and they were extremely rude and had no manors. If your passport did not work you had to wait in another queue which meant you had to see one of the men at the desk in border control (understandable), the queue took forever to go down and we were all shoved so tightly together there was 0 social distancing in place. I then got told (not asked) by the guy who worked at the machines to retry my passport after waiting in line for a long time already, once again this did not work but I was then sent to the back of the queue. When I asked about this they said it was because I tried again - even though I wasn’t given the choice not to. This also happened to another young girl that complained about the situation only to be approached and confronted by the man working on the machines, this woman was actually cried and had a panic attack meanwhile he was continuing to confront her. A man in the queue actually tried to help the woman bySticking up to her but was also spoken to very rudely. We then waited another 20+ minutes in the queue with no social distancing. This man was clearly power mad and just a nasty, arrogant ‘man’. They are well aware there is little that can be said to them and they use this the their advantage. I understand they are not going to sit and chat and that they need to be straight with their instructions for the process to work. However, that was beyond firm or straight it was rude and that man is a bully. It’s a shame as the majority are helpful and polite, this man should not have a job.",1
636,"Time and time again, when we arrive at the airport from abroad, the queues are horrific. If you have kids then you have to go into the ""family lane"" at border control, whilst everyone else goes through the automated section.  The queue in the family lane was horrendous. 100s of people, in a queue for what seemed like an eternity. Whilst there was literally no one at the other section. Kids were getting agitated, it's like they punish people for having children. My 5 year old little girl actually wet herself as she was struggling to hold it in for that long. Other young kids were getting stressed out and very upset. No social distancing at all. To top it off, it's £6 to drop someone off at the airport! And they even charge £1 for a luggage trolley. Whoever makes the decisions at this poor excuse of an airport needs to go.",1

639,Hi I just want to write a review for the t3 multi storey carpark staff at Manchester airport and how they helped me out so much! So last Friday me and my friend arrived back from mallorca around 3pm time as I went back for my car it wouldn't start as I got in as I think i left a light on in it buy since I was stranded there and I live in barnsley and my family couldn't get over to me and my friend didn't know what to do my dad told me to speak to someone through the speakers at the barriers! They then told me that help 2as on the way in 15 mins but within 5 mins someone was out to help me and got my car started back up again without no charge so I would just like to say how grateful I am and how thankful i am for helping me out and I will never forget itMany thanks Alex,5
640,"Having used the drop and go car park. Tools were stolen from the boot of my car I used the feedback form as soon as I discovered the loss this has a ten day turnaround. 3 days into this serious allegation I've heard nothing, just sat here getting angrier. So I called the airport having finally found a number to get an automated reply stating that no updates will be given before the ten days are up. So here I am not knowing if they've read the complaint, whether they are going to investigate it or how long their cctv records for. This a very poor way to treat your customers even if they are a captive market needing to travel from to Manchester.",1

Used the slot, expecting it to process the payment within a couple of seconds,  as on motorway toll roads. It took so long I thought it was broken so I removed the card and had to ring for help. Still ended up waiting for it to process the card. Finally got through the barrier to the traffic lights at the exit which turned red as I drove up to them. No other traffic anywhere but the sensors must be faulty and I had to wait several minutes until another vehicle arrived before they changed . Can't think of a better way to create such a bad impression in such a short time.",1

Airports in general are stressful but this one takes the biscuit ,my advice is if its possible travel through a different airport like Liverpool.",1
651,Worst international airport in the whole world. They charge you £5 for drop off. The staffs are rude and the parking charges are outrageous. Drop my wife at terminal 1 didn't even take 2 minutes and had to pay £5. Please do not use this airport if you can,1
652,Decided to pay for Fastrack Secuity at T1 after reading some of the reviews and seeing there was 7 other flights leaving around the same time.  Great at the beginning - flashed the confirmation and straight down the dedicated lane to what I'd expected to be a dedicated 'belt and scanner. Wrong!!!!! The forceful woman 'directing ' people to the  belts was directing people from the non fastback queues into ours. So we had to wait while they were able to go through faster than us ( and they weren't people who were fastrack but in the wrong queue). So not sure what we paid for but doubt I'd be fooled into doing so again. Take my chances in the non fastrack queue if that's how it works!,2
653,"DO NOT USE THIS AIRPORT IF YOU CAN AVOID IT.Took my mother away to visit family and returned to terminal 1 yesterday. I had asked for special assistance as my mother needs a wheelchair to travel through the airport. All was fine until we left the aircraft and entered the terminal. 1 person to push 4 people in wheelchairs through to customs then we wait there for an age. Finally get through there and pick up baggage. Still only one poor lady helper and 4 people in wheelchairs. This is the only airport with bad service and stupid drop off and pick up rules. I had to try and push my disabled mother and pull 2 cases to pick up point for the taxi I had ordered, while black cabs can wait right outside the door.When will Manchester Airport wake up and look at other airports abroad?",1
654,"New terminal, same old problems. An absolute farce. Arrived 2 and half hours before flight was due to depart and after long delays to check in and even longer at security, I had to run for my plane.

Returned from holiday to find there was no room to take us all back in one car to the car park and we paid £20 for a taxi instead. Found my car had been moved, mirror and other controls changed so guessed staff had joyrided my car or used it to relay passengers from the airport. Other customers complained of exactly the same thing. Under no circumstances should you use this shambles of a company.Just so you know Cheshire police have now confirmed my car was illegally used whilst I was away on holiday. Trading Standards will be visiting.",1

This International Airport is a total disgrace and no one cares. I always try to fly from Liverpool, however, it isn’t always possible. Security is another weakness, putting all your worldly goods into plastic trays that you then loose sight of is always concerning, I ended up with someone else’s passport. I have insisted to stay in sight of my tray but have been on receiving end of hostile behaviour and threats. They will have the perfect excuse now “oh it’s Covid” oh it’s Brexit.",1
658,"Absolute disgrace.Went  through T2,  5th  of sept.Long wait  to get through the booking in desks.Security  was just chaos, staff rude, and seem to take delight  in making the passengers wait.One asked me to open the zip on my bag , when I went to open it ,as he had asked ,he snatched it away  and asked for my boarding card, then went to a machine  twice stopped off to chat to his colleague,  despite knowing I had 10 minutes to get on my flight, thankfully his supervisor  took contol of the situation  and was a completed  contrast to  the first gentlemen,  professional  and friendly.  Lots of passengers were left  panicking as their planes were due to leave,  the gentlemen next to me was already  30 minutes  passed  his departure  time at this point stuck .He was actually  in front of me in the booking hall, but thankfully  we had bought  fast tag for the security, dread to think what would happen  if we didn't  have themWe had to run to get onto the plane despite getting into the airport nearly 3 hours before, we didn't have any time to shop or get a cup of tea, just a mad dash to the gate.Several passengers on are flight  got on after us, after facing similar experiences, which left late.considering there was a total of about 70 people on are flight, it meant about 10% of the people had arrived late through no fault of their own.Dread to think, how this airport would cope  if the flights were full, there were 7 flights leaving in about  2 to 3 hours on this day, but most would have been below capacity.stressful  start to the holiday.Coming back  a week later, was OK for us was thankfully.  An hour later it was delays again, for people arriving.In contrast, Mahon( menorca)  airport, was  the exact, opposite, professional, friendly  and calm.We will avoid in the future   if I can in the future, not a pleasant experience.I work with the public  , face to face with the public every  day in the Rail industry  and formally  worked at Manchester  Airport  years  a go, so know the pressure  the can find themselves  in but, The standard  of staff  interaction  with the travelling public  is sadly  well below what should  be expected .",1
659,"So we arrive at Manchester Airport and check in with Jet 2 which was a pleasurable, easy and stress free process, they had lots of friendly professional staff. Then the fun begins because we are now dealing with the staff employed by Manchester Airport, more specifically the overzealous inefficient security staff!. Now of course (as they did) they will blame the management and most certainly the incompetent management that have always run the airport badly are the same poor management that now run the new T2, so yes they are ultimately to blame. Its not rocket science... If you take bad management from a run down airport and put them in a super new terminal they aren't suddenly going to become good management DOH!We got to security and out of the 10 stations available they had 3 working with a queue going out the door!! Everyone was horrified by the length of the queue and how long it was taking but conveniently due to security risks we weren't able to film this shambles. (Nicely played Manchester Airport). So eventually we get to the point where we put our harmless and innocuous goods into a tray and proceed to be searched and frisked and of course our tray is rejected along with a disproportionate number of trays (Fair play if they were reporting that their overzealous scrutiny was catching 6 dangerous items a day or even a week but no, there is surely and issue with the system as not one single tray was a problem) I'm unaware of other airports in the world who's security staff don't make a mission out of inconveniencing passengers having an issue! Anyway our tray came through on the other side of the screen to be checked in detail and that's when it all went ""tits up"". The system of handling trays in order was not happening and the ONE operator was lifting trays behind our and dealing with them before ours. I saw a group of ""white shirt"" supervisors sitting together and suggested they might want to get hands on and support the ONE blue shirt operator as the situation was chaotic. They all in one voice said ""it's the managements fault we don't have enough staff""... I agreed but also suggested the staff they did have needed supervision and maybe instead of sitting around they could get hands on and help. This is clearly not what they are used to being told and rather than realising they had a job to do they took exception to being told what they should be doing and decided I would be taught a lesson in how they had the power to delay me even more. This small minded unprofessionalism led by ""he with the beard"" was appalling.You see what these people forget is I'm not out to shame them or highlight how ineffective they are at their job, I'm simply wanting to get on my flight. They see you as the person causing them grief and so you you will just be kept waiting! They don't have the humanity to see you as the person who is stressed because your now going to miss your flight, the person who is simply trying to take his wife (a police officer) who has spent the last 2 days at a traumatic crime scene involving children for a well deserved break. Someone who hasn't stopped during the covid crisis to serve her community and who is traumatised and exhausted and most certainly not deserving of this appalling treatment by the small minded man with the beard who simply didn't care and who even after reading this will have no conscience regarding what he knows to have been disgraceful execution of his job!He then took great pleasure in failing to point us in the right direction for our departure gate and waited on us returning from our sprint round the duty free area and shops to arrive back at the security point where he smiled at us with a smarmy your going to miss your flight look on his face.My wife didn't deserve this treatment after all she's been through and done for her community, but we continued to race to the gate where we were met by the AMAZING staff from Jet 2 who had waited on us and were simply brilliant and were appalled by our exhausted state and how we'd been treated. They looked after us on the flight and were the only saving grace of this awful and disgraceful experience at this horrendous airport. SHAME ON YOU MANCHESTER AIRPORT... SHAME ON YOU!!!",1

On my wifes recovery, Carol took control and made our passage through security much easier. Carol and her colleagues, when it mattered stepped up to the mark and I have nothing but praise and appreciation for Carol and her colleagues. Thank you all so much.",5
663,"Very badly organised. Queued for nearly an hour. The place was unnecessarily manic, it wasn't a nice experience at all. Far too many flights leaving the airport at the one time and security cannot handle the amount of people at once.",1
664,"Avoid terminal 2 they only have 2 micro bars where you have to queue for ages for no well known lagers, You cannot even get get a decent glass of wine. Very disappointing start to holiday with chargeable for drop off. 50 minutes going though passport control on return  as not all machines working.  The pickup area is horrendous and chargeable will avoid this airport from now on.",1
665,"Avoid. In T1 you are all crammed into an airless space with 100s people, then reach a single-file line, penned-in like sheep, with a metal a bar on one side and the wall on the other, all the while being repeatedly shouted at. You then find after the 40+ min hot and humid shuffle that they only have 3 scanners on at peak time, one of which is reserved for priority customers. You are then interrogated by a rude person, and the chances are your bag will be taken for inspection even if there is nothing wrong with it (another 30 min wait). It is like a form of abuse, where you are a captive and have to submit yourself to discomfort and stress as some kind of weird gulag-like punishment ritual. Definitely the worst airport in all the 43 airports in the world I have flown in and out of, by a very long way.",1
666,"Don’t know how they get away with it - departed Friday 10th notices everywhere advising social distancing and use of masks inside the terminal. How they manage that with arrivals and departures using the same door is unbelievable. Most people in the terminal not wearing masks & not being challenged by staff. Add to that total bewilderment by security staff, and complete confusion - even advising customers “if you don’t get your electrical equipment in the correct  tray you’ll have to wait another 45 mins” also what happened to the plastic bag rule - I saw one security guy stuffing loads of liquid items in a plastic bag that wouldn’t close.

Security at the airport is poorly orchestrated and provides an unpleasant start to one’s holiday.,1

676,"Did the T1 drop off and spent over 5 minutes queing to pay to leave, as a result went over the ten minutes allowed and was charged £25. Had no reply from the airport. The queues were appalling in T1 terminal and ended up running to the plane",1
677,"on 24th august, i had the misfortune to return from holiday to terminal 2, there are 30 border police passport control points, 4 were manned,, there were 5000 people passing through the terminal to enter England,, it was a national embarrassment, this is an international airport run by lazy management, the management are still taking full advantage of furlow they are at home, playing golf, or holidaying themselves, the airport is a shambles, the que of people standing next to each other for 2 hours is dangerous it breaks all covid rules, but the airport management and border control don't give a fig for covid rules, its a national disgrace, the airport management should be ashamed and those responsible be immediately sacked from office... can anyone tell me the best place to take my complaint, this acute mismanagement needs to be addressed and soon....",1

679,"Recently had the misfortune to travel via Manchester airport’s T1 - out of the numerous flight journeys we’ve made worldwide, Manchester airport has been our worst security experience by far. They have the most pointless, ineffective  system and nothing that makes air travel any safer. This is topped by the rudest, most unprofessional staff who should never be in a customer facing role. Every electronic item has to touch the tray base 100% with not even a mm overlap, bags need to be ‘lengthwise’ even if it fits perfectly inside the tray any other way, bags containing liquids can only be in their bags even if its only 1 chapstick in a slightly bigger bag - and there was a seemingly middle aged male security staff who kept rudely shouting at my children and I even while we were trying to sort items as per their rules, leaving my children upset and worried. I was made to go through the body scanner and then frisked again by a security staff, not sure what the point of the body scanner was then. It took us around a 45 minute wait in the queue to get to the security and another 15 minutes to get through it. The whole experience was a nightmare like no other and I would rather drive longer to another airport than fly from Manchester again.",1
680,The friendliest and best run airport I have been in.,5
681,I would put zero stars but you can’t we raised a complaint due to an experience with Manchester airports assistance lane security all I wanted from the complaint was for the security team to realised children with additional needs don’t react in the same way as other children my son was clearly distressed due to a security searched of which was brought upon him suddenly rather than the staff member talking to him first so he could get to know him but the way the search was carried out is ok with Manchester airport because my son was not distressed on there cctv however members of the public came over to me to make sure my son was ok please be vigilant when travelling with Manchester airport thank you,1
682,"Check in for Tui was a complete disaster. After 45 minutes in a queue and less than half way through we were obviously going to miss our flight, with only a handful of staff working they finally told everyone on our flight to go to the front.What a nightmare I will go to Stansted next time.",1
683,"After 15 minutes study of the pick up options for Terminal 1, I still ended up doing several circles on the airport roundabouts with 2 other cars. Website information for pick-up fails to mention that there are 2 (TWO) multistory carparks at T1. At least they do offer the (rip-off) pricing at the roundabout exits, which is why people keep driving in circles. Really unpleasant experience. Easiest for pick up is T1&station parking which gives you 30 minutes for £6. What happens after 30 minutes is not clear and may include a hefty increase similar to the drop off £25?",2
684,The most confusing airport ever!!  I walked miles and miles.  Staff v rude and unhelpful.  BA Terminal 5 so much better.,1
685,Everybody has to wear a mask but nobody bother about cleaning tables. I cleaned my table at Starbucks with alco gel.,1

687,"Omg.. I have arrived at my holiday destination and two days in i can not get that security experience out of my head... I have no problem with my bags being checked or having to empty alot of products into the bin.. To inclued chap stick.. Can someone tell me when that became a liquid lol..... disgusting and unprofessional staff at evey level. I witness and was at the brunt of, what i would consider to be agressive and bullying behavior. People were pushed shouted at bags everywhere packed in with no directon or guidance.. Just told move get over there i said move 😮 i was a party of 5 and two whom are young girls ..whom are so upset.. . They are frightened to return home. I will be escalating this as amatter for the press and possibly a solicitor. Not one person took or asked me security questions or asked for any paperwork regarding covid. They took all of my lipsticks.. makeup etc and left a par of hooked scissors in my makeup bag. That i had forgotten to take out! Angry upset and cant relax now.. I just feel so shocked, seriously like i was going to prison and this was the precheck before doin time... If its possible use another airport.. As a parent, i would NEVER put my child knowingly through that again.. 😡😡😡😡😡😡",1
688,Absolutely dreadful airport. Had a 15 minute walk from departing the aircraft to passport control. The pick up point is absolute mayhem. There no space to social distance and so many cars there is scope for a serious accident. For the pleasure of this experience you get to pay manchester airport £6.00. Thats additional to the £5.00 charged for a 2 min drop off. If you can fly from a different airport avoid Manchester,1
689,I had written a review after our journey on 11 June 2021 about our experience of traveling through Manchester airport and very conveniently I find it missing here. I can produce a copy of our tickets to prove that we did travel on the date and also proof of our complaints on their website of missing items (in our case a set of earrings) we were traveling with our fifteen months old and the whole scene at the airport was a chaos. The body check was done so fast but the bag screening was so slow that all the people were squeezed in one area at the end of the security with covid rules of social distancing out the window and during this our bags must have been opened and checked without us being present to see if the items are back in place. When we were let go I just had a feeling things were missing or I just felt like checking it to see anything missing and I didn't do that for every bag but for one bag that was easy to open and there I found my two pouches of items not being put back in place and even though it was kept aside and not in anyone's pocket the inconvenience of having to run back and fetch it while it was time to feed our baby was cumbersome and plain annoying and apart from that I found the earrings in my bag missing but we were told to make the complain on the website. I know they might argue it could have been dropped on the way or wherever but I kept a tab on the item as far as I could and found it missing at the right time to zero in on the time of the security check. We have decided nexf time we want to visit parents we will go through Liverpool airport. Such unease while traveling is not worth it and even if it doesn't happen again we would rather travel stress free that our items won't be flicked.,1
690,"We recently travelled to Gran Canaria , and like all countries that are on the Amber list a “proof of negative test before departing and returning is required, as per Gov.uk website.So why when we travelled through Manchester Airport, did we not provide this at any time, leaving or returning.We spent over £ 400.00 on tests for them not to even ask for them, the whole thing is “ red tape” so the government can say we are doing everything we can to protect our people, where in fact there not doing anythingGood old Britain, just a constant carpet, being walked over time and time again by everyone",1
691,One of the most efficient and clean airports in the world. I have travelled through lots of airports and I stand by the great work this airport does to be helpful to its customers.,5
692,"Avoid if you can. Staff, especially security around the outside of the airport building, need customer service training. Never seen such a bunch of miserable people who appear to dislike their job and passengers. A smile may crack their faces.",1
693,"Due to ""no refund"" policy and uncertainty of journey due to Covid i delayed booking until last minute. Cost risen £90!!!! Why??? Airport is quiet, no need to hike the price unless you cover all angles of extricating as much as possible from the punter. Absolute sharks, will never use them again",1
694,"Easy to book a parking place, unfortunately our flight was cancelled but easy to get a full refund online...which we have already received.",4
695,"Total rip off to drop off there, £5. Everything about the place is about taking money, worst airport in UK for sure.",1

697,"16 days left,, and I would have been employed by Manchester airport 2 years.   They ended my contract of employment, on the 31st March 2021, so I could not have them for unfair dismissal.. the ""Bradford scale"" what a joke drivers were made redundant,appealed and had their points put back, and they kept their job,so why was I treated so differently.   To succeed in the coach driving position only requires a few basic skills, you have to make brews for your line manager, buy him his super,buy him cakes go on holiday,with him. Blow Smoke up his A##e, there's still drivers there during my time, never went out doing the job he gets paid for""yep driving ""  taking his favorite pal off the road so he can sit in the office (playing games on their mobile phones) with him all night stitching other drivers up to cover his shift..""only time will tell who the real reliable ones are"" to those who knew me it was a pleasure.",1
698,"Worst airport on this planet. Never update flight timings. Kept on showing flight scheduled arrival at 15:35 till 16:27 then updated as delayed with new time 16:47 which shifted to 17:07 then 17:36 then it showed up as Baggage completed and taken off the screen. Manchester airport denied taking the responsibility of timings shown on their screen and I ended up accumulating £20 parking charges as of now which will be £55 very shortly - flight just arrived on Google and their system - no idea whether it really is or not. Manchester airport blames the airline for putting information whereas the information desk agent himself had to ask someone inside for the real I fo as it was off the screen and stated wrong info was updated by SOMEONE.Worst customer services at terminal 1 information desk as I had to step in when the agent at 16:07 shouted at a passenger who was wrongly guided and left his wife and kid at baggage claim. Words like cocky and shi**y used also saying 'not in a mood to help you'. Information desk clerk clearly sounded racist to the gentleman whose first language wasn't English - sounded like a European or may be someone from an Arab country. Upon my intervention, the clerk turned down his tone. Extremely rude, dishonest people with no regrets and no sense of responsibility.",1
699,"Security at Manchester Airport is a joke! After having eight second leg flights to Manchester cancelled by BA, KLM and EasyJet we finally managed to secure a flight with Lufthansa. Well done Lufthansa.  When we arrived in Frankfurt from Athens we were met at the top of the arrival tunnel by at least 10 armed policemen and every single passenger was taken to one side and questioned about PLFs and Covid test certificates before we were allowed into the airport. By comparison at MA it was very different. Questioning was at random. Three men in front of us one older man and two youths were asked where they were from and what was their purpose in the U.K. The youths just looked at the older man as they obviously couldn’t speak English or they relied on the older man for guidance.”They are working with me” was the response, “Doing what?” he was again asked, “ oh we do everything”. The policeman ushered them through but I must add, in all fairness the guard did write something on his purple rubber glove...obviously important information to be saved. We are in the middle of a Covid pandemic and we are told to stay at home, our security borders are the laughing stock of the world.",2
700,"The female security checking my body was unbelievably rude, I wasn’t even mad as much as i was shocked, how can someone be like that? Airport management incase your reading this, this was at terminal 1 departure A, a lady with died goldnish blonde hair and her original black hair starting to grow, she looks asian, slightly chinese eyes look. Kindly advice her to be more respectful and friendly. Very unprofessional and will definitely effect the whole airports reputation unfortunately.However the bright side the men were so friendly and helpful honestly, I can’t thank them enough, they did their job pretty well yet maintained good mood and formality. Complete opposite.",2
701,Travelled at this airport - not very well sign posted for covid and the car park is too far and expensive when you are travelling with lots of baggage.,3

703,"Once again security T1 departures is consistent in their rudeness, miserable approach, look like they don’t want to be there, poor customer service, parking charges too mouch",1
704,"So disappointed and upset. Dropped my husband off for a 3 month work trip tonight. We followed the signs to the drop off zone, avoiding cars just stopped in the middle of the road unloading (now I know why!). Our little boys were upset that daddy was leaving and took a bit of persuasion to let him go. As I tried to leave there was a barrier upon exit, I reversed up as thought I must have made a mistake. No other way out! So I drove back to it to be told £25 to exit!!! I called the operator who said we were 16 minutes which is parking not drop off!! Never did we see that this was the charge. The confusion just to get to where we thought we were meant to be is hard enough without adding in dodging stopped vehicles etc. What a kick in teeth on what is already a crappy day. Thanks so much Manchester airport",1
705,"OVER PRICED PARKING absolutely disgusted i used the car park for 30mins and was charged £12, thats 40p a minute",1
706,"I am horrified by the treatment of the security staff. They kept me waiting for literally 1 whole hour just unpacking my whole suitcase, checking each one of my make up products, going over every single part of my suitcase, grabbing my toothbrush and swabbing it, as if they had never seen a toothbrush before. They just seemed to enjoy making a big deal out of absolutely every product within my bag, then said that products like toothbrushes and phone chargers need rechecking. I almost lost my flight due to their incompetence and rudeness. They did the same to anywhere very old couple just ahead of me, the old lady having to sit down while his husband had to repack both their suitcases. Absolutely appalling behaviour from the staff at Manchester airport, I had already heard bad reviews and experiences by this was just a joke. I will try to avoid travelling from Manchester at all costs.",1
707,After arriving at the airport with my 13 year old son we were directed to the scanners for passports I raised concerns that my sons passport would not work and was told in a condescending manner ’of course it will madam’ and again I was directed through mine scanned and I stood waiting for my sons but they said move forward you can't wait. At this point me and my son where on opposite sides of the border control I asked to return to him as he was now on his own but this was refused and they moved him to a another queue with adults. This is disgraceful in my opinion a mother should not be separated from her child if he is a minor it was a further 15 mins before he got through border control and it has really upset him and me. He went through border control as a minor and they didn't even ask him who he was with this is a massive breach of safeguarding. Border control you should be ashamed you have caused a child fear with this little Hitler mentality when a bit of customer care would of helped alleviate this. Shame on you!,1
708,I expected better security and customer service during covid when customers are feeling nervous.  The airport needs better signposting and more visible bodies to assist customers.  4 is for previous good service.,4

710,"Went to pick up parents from airport, cause as they are considered vulnerable, and not wise to take public transport.Price hikes on drop off/pick up options from Free -> £3 to now £6/10mins in the space of a few years and now during a pandemic? Disappointing.",1

712,I was not impressed with the security on my recent trip. Everything else was very good at the airport.,4
713,"As is always the case when having to use Manchester Airport it must be the worst in the world for baggage reclaim.  There is no explanation as to why it always takes nearly an hour for luggage to start coming through.  Why is that?  Terrible, terrible airport",1

715,A great range of flights daily and right on our doorstep. What more could you ask for?,5
716,"The staff throughout the airport are friendly and helpful, however the airport, particularly terminal 1 are very outdated and run down. Having arrived back from Venice Airport in Italy I was shocked as to how dark and dirty Manchester airport appeared, compared to the modern and spotlessly clean airports abroad, especially in Italy and Spain. This creates a poor impression of the country, especially for visitors arriving from overseas.",3
717,This was first experience of Manchester terminal 3 old tatty needs to be ripped down as service sooooo slow even with hardly any flights !Security a joke don’t think they knew what to do I said should I take shoes off yes ! Then half dozen people behind me kept there ones on what’s the point !!! Do your job properly !!! We all depend on it for safety !!! Shops and social distance don’t happen !!!,1
718,"Twice this year, I’ve used T3 parking. In March it was Meet & Greet,  very close to Terminal & easy to use. However on pick up , about a mile down the road, the car had a dreadful rattle . Later investigation found the exhaust was vibrating having shed a clip. It was fine on service & when it entered the car park .Who drives them in the car parking ?Despite this I used T3 Drop & Go a couple of weeks ago.(M&G is closed)  It’s dreadful , fully automated and a good 10-15 minute slog to T3. Very poorly signed in and out.On return , after a good walk with luggage I find I need to go to different levels for key retrieval etc. I find car . One wing mirror out, clearly has been hit & the other in. Sorry at the prices you charge ... take a bit more care with people’s cars . Both mirrors should be in & checked before leaving the car. Just push the button. Can I prove my assertions 100% , of course not. Have I complained ? Why there’s nobody there to complain to. They’ve just lost my business. Drop & Go isn’t recommended , you are as well paying less & parking off airport . Especially if you have luggage , children etc. At least the shuttle buses drop you at the door and you park your own car !- Due to Covid 19 . Be warned the airport is dead, there are no staff to assist and parking don’t answer the number they give you. Sorry Manchester Airport you need to do better, your prices haven’t gone down to reflect these changes.",3
719,Sat on the plane to Antalta now 16.40pm jet 2 mon 5/10/20 just want to thank the team for keeping us informed about what was going on  re numbers on the flight  Also to the lady who when I was boarding wished me happy Birthday...i always travel on my birthday but normally no-one notices so much appreciated   Thanks Lisa xxx,5

I have been trying to telephone them since Friday evening, only to hear a recorded message saying we are now closed please telephone back tomorrow after 8am. Have a guess, tomorrow comes and the same message is played. It is now Monday, I managed to get through to a voicemail box and am awaiting a call back. I simply want to extend my car park parking without being ripped off. The option to do this online doesn't exist. Pathetic.",1
722,"The level of Covid control is terrible. With a lot more customers than usual and less eateries open, there are crowds of people and no social distancing! Queues for every eatery again with no social distancing or staff control, food is being sold in open counters (Upper Crust) with three staff members chatting and breathing over it - wearing masks but constantly touching them and wearing them below the nose, nobody cleaning tables or policing people pushing them together to form large groups for drinking together. The security hall was packed! again no social distancing and although we were fast tracked the staff were handling peoples phones to review the booking. I was horrified. It is as though they have packed everyone into one terminal with no concern about numbers and nobody managing the situation. It sounds from other reviews that this situation has been happening for weeks. Environmental Health should be made aware.",1
723,Recent problems with our plane tickets need to sort this out,3
724,"In Covid Times, we expected some specific virus controls, on entering the airport,  but nobody cared about taking our temperature or whatsoever. Luggage security checks were very slow and chaotic. We had our purse checked twice because at first the employee did not see the iPad. We told him and he answered in a very arrogant and rude way. It took us 20 minutes’ wait, which is unacceptable. Meanwhile, most of the employees were nicely chatting instead of helping people out and actually do their job. Unfortunately Leeds airport doesn’t have many flights and we had to come to Manchester. We’ll do our best to avoid it next times.",2
725,The Manchester Airport Group which owns the airport and also Skypark Secure and Looking 4 Parking is one hell of a scam company and needs an urgent Government enquiry into its monopoly position and scam practices.I went on holiday for 2 weeks in March and had to come back after 2 days because of covid. I lost out on 12 days parking on the car park.I then had another holiday cancelled in April . L4P did not tell me that they no longer had my credit card details so did not refund me and just kept my money . I complained and they asked for my bank details. I sent them the details but did a typo . According to L4P they have resolved this issue with their bank but my money is still not back in my bank account and today is September 9th. Also if and when I do get my money back they are going to deduct over £11 admin fee . This company L4P and Jet2 are the worst companies that I have had to deal with since covid and they will never get any business from me or my family or indeed anyone who is sensible enough to listen to me again,1
726,Always use manchester airport to travel and was impressed with their coronavirus measures they have in place.,5
727,Never fails to amaze me how bad this airport is.Worst international airport i have ever used.Hardly any flights at the moment due to covid yet we are sat on the runway for 30 mins now while the luggage team walk randomly around the plane asking passengers how many bags they checked as they are short some.Cant even get the bags from the desk to the plane with literally no flights out of Ringway.Jet 2 complete Joke as always.Social distancing non existent.Detest this airport.,1
728,"Trying to plan parking to drop a relative with disabilities who is flying alone is a f***ing nightmare. Manchester airport website is contradicting, with very unclear information about how to park to drop someone off and help the person to the check-in point and find their way around the airport. Contacted the airport parking but no reply at all. I am unsure if I can park anywhere with ease and simplicity like you can at Liverpool or even Stanstead Airports, and quote I am getting from their ""discounted early booking"" for a 1 hour parking is quoted at £45 minimum. I am absolutely disgusted with these con artists.",1
729,"Wasn't sure what to expect, however it was a seemless experience. Check in had less than a one minute queue, security (T1B) had no queue and staff were friendly. It probably took less than a minute from entering to leaving. Almost everyone wore their face covering correctly and there was plenty of room for physical distancing.  It was a very relaxed and pleasant experience.",5
730,Official parking Website down and gives a phone number to contact. Phone number closed during normal working day.Promises a call back tomorrow but no call backs. Meanwhile how do I get my car back??!! A very poor organisation with inadequate systems and customer care.,1

Spanish Malaga Airport were excellent checked I had my QR code and  carried out temperature checks and Masks had to be worn at all times. Landed back in Manchester on 15th Aug where I sailed through the airport only showing my passport. No checks done on Public Health Locator Forms and No Temperature checks done!!!🤔",1
732,"Travellers beware - this is not a safe place to be.I honestly can’t believe that having had three months to make changes to ensure social distancing and safe travel, that this airport is being allowed to operate as it is today. Clearly nobody in charge has taken the time to make the journey through the airport as a traveller to see where touch points can be eliminated and improvements made.Having gone through fast track the operative scanning boarding cards handled every phone in our family of five in order to scan our boarding passes. He probably handled thousands on just the day we travelled! Passing germs and viruses from one phone to the next!At luggage scanning there was just one scanner operating. No social distancing between staff and no control mechanism for passengers. It was no different than it has ever been in terms of crowding apart from everyone wearing masks! We had to take and touch a tray ourselves which had probably been handled by thousands of people beforehand without it being cleaned. Then the staff member proceeded to maul all my belongings whilst moving them around in the tray. Collecting our belongings, everyone was crowded in the area just like they always have been previously along with at least half a dozen staff members.The one way system signage around the terminal is on the floor and completely lost in other advertising and under the feet of passengers. Seating areas have been cornered off leaving fewer places to sit and causing congregating where people walk.On boarding the plane, the boarding gate was in a narrow corridor with seats either side. There was no room to distance from other passengers and that was before other passengers on other flights had to push through our queue to reach boarding gates further down the corridor! Boarding was nothing short of a shambles with the Jet2.com staff clearly not having a clue how to deal with the situation.Someone seriously needs to take a look at all the touch points and bottlenecks through this airport and put things in place to help stop the spread of this virus. Having experienced a trip through T1 I can’t help but feel that we are partly responsible for the recent spike in cases.Someone please take a serious look at making this place safer before we are back to not bring able to travel at all!For anyone who is going through the airport in the near future, be sure to take plenty of antibacterial wipes to wipe all your belongings down and have your hand sanitiser at the ready!",1
733,"Security was absolutely shambolic. Travelling with family/children?? Avoid like the plague. Especially security B.Post lockdown levels of passengers yet still a looooong queue as only one scanner open. By the way, security B is a maze of stairs and hidden lifts. I’m travelling alone with a toddler who will not leave my side during security yet it’s insisted I stand alone in the body scanner. Toddler leaves my side for no more than 5 seconds, and security staff grab her by the wrist and pulls her away from me in the scanner, whilst another coworker fails in his attempts at entertaining/distracting my toddler with a tray. Toddler freaks out with the woman grabbing her by the wrist and ends up getting extremely upset and clinging to my leg and screaming at the top of her lungs. I sternly ask her not to do that as she’s hurting and upsetting my already stressed child. She would not have grabbed an adult by the wrist and pulled like she did to my daughter, whilst my daughter panics and cries out for me.   I ask if we can’t just go through the walk through scanner, and she says no - the rules are that if the body scanner is available I must be scanned in that, and that she’s just doing her job. So they finally decide to do a complete search instead. A supervisor turns up to hover but has nothing useful or comforting to say. When I tell her we were forced to go through the body scanner travelling alone with a child, the woman pipes up and says we weren’t forced to go through it. And says this repeatedly, contradicting me. However, I was certainly not offered a choice!! Meanwhile my daughter is begging and crying for her pacifier which is on the tray going through the bag scanner *rolls eyes* which I’d been asked to send through with the bags because it was bulging in my pocket. She pats me down. Then tells me she also needs to do the same to my daughter (having man handled her earlier). I explain to my daughter what’s about to happen (woman tries to tell my daughter she’s going to give her a tickle), woman looks to me for approval, and I tell her to just do it quickly and get it over with. A completely unnecessarily stressful experience with zero consideration nor respect for children. Utterly poor customer service, and quite frankly, child abuse.",1

I'm sure people power will prevail.",1
739,I booked parking at T3 for a flight that was obviously cancelled due to the ongoing pandemic. When I asked Manchester airport for a refund or voucher they said it’s not their fault and will not refund or give a voucher. I’m surprised as mist of the travel industry is at least at least giving vouchers. I had a separate parking booking with holiday extras and they refunded a voucher without asking. Very poor of such an organisation.,1
740,The airport management seriously need to look at the airport as it is chaos!,3
741,New car park is not convenient pushing large trolly with a family. The short stay is far too expensive. Standard of service at the airport has drastically gone down. Hope things improve!,4

I had to park up and drop my elderly mother at the airport, the walk round for her was horrendous! she was tired and upset by the time she checked in.  I hope with all the money they make at the airport they will consider elderly and vulnerable customers.",2
743,"We had to travel through this airport with work so didn’t have a choice of airport. Check in with the airline was really good. Airport security was the worst I’ve ever had to deal with. They where rude. They could see we had a 5 year old with us who had never flown before. We only had an option of automatic passport gates that my daughter had to use by her self. We flatly refused when it nearly trapped her. I will be reporting this to the hse. They told us we had to use the disabled route. This was not said before the incident. Then they used our case as the “test” (where they put something in to check the detection) I asked the lady who put it in what she was doing and her replay was “you will see” I understand they have to do this but when you already have a distressed child and then you have to stand to one side as they lazy staff take there time to remove the item. if you have kids, don’t use this airport. I fly a lot with work and we all say it the worst airport we have to fly through. I favour driving down to London and staying in a hotel over using this airport. I won’t be using this airport again when flying as a family.",1
744,I know its been a difficult time and i am not one for a having a moan but.We landed at Manchester on the ist of April after 25 hr journey from Brisbane.Iknow they probably had minimum staff for safety reasons but we were really tired when we disembarked there was no one to ask for assistance my sister is in her eighties non of the automatic walk ways were running and we were given no information at all about self isolating .All the other airports on our journey home really looked after us except Manchester you have a lot to learn about looking after passengers,1
745,Travelling through terminal 3 in March with my husband and daughter when a young gentleman fell ill found out he had epilepsy woman from security arrived found out her name was pat this lady took charge of the situation when others were panicking she was brilliant very calming organised everyone even lifted the gentleman down to a safe place with help she kept talking to him and calming him down but at the same time was getting the information from him ready for the paramedics to step in I would like to thank this lady for keeping calm when everyone else was losing their heads well done Manchester airport for your speedy response to someone in need it makes me feel better that competent people work here well done pat keep up the good work,5
746,"Bad place to visit, bad place to work, bad place to drop people off, bad place to eat, bad place to fly from. Avoid at all costs!Working here will give you mental health problems, the managers should all be sacked they couldnt organise a p**s up in a brewery and they are bullies. The staff can all go to hell too. TOXIC PLACE!SexistHomophobicRacistCesspit!!!Lets hope COVID19 thins out the herd and this place becomes public property again!",1
747,Booked 10 days Meet & Greet Parking with the official on-site car-park. Dropped car off at 07:00am...flight got cancelled 2 hrs later (due to FCO/Spanish Government advice). Returned to pick car up & everyone in the same circumstances (there were dozens of people queuing to get cars back) were specifically told to go the website where we would be issued a full refund. One month later an email to say no refund due to circumstances beyond the airport's control. At least 6 flights were cancelled that day so the airport have retained several thousand pounds worth of customer's money for providing zero service and expecting the buck to be passed to insurance companies. Appalling service.,1
748,"Had to cancel parking due to the current coronavirus crisis (flight cancelled) As this is a unique issue other airports parking providers are giving full refunds even though customers don't have the additional "" protection option"" WHY. I can appreciate if I had taken the decision not to travel but when the FCO and airline had made the decision for me, it's outside of my control.Once this crisis is over the airport is going to be looking for support from travelers, do you think this refund policy really encourages us ?",1
749,Probably the worst possible service and communication. My flight was cancelled due to coronavirus and I asked for a refund of the parking fee as I obviously no longer want to park. The cost was £27 and they said there will be £15 cancellation fee. This is not commercially justified given that I notify nearly 2 months before the date. Businesses like that are disgrace for otherwise nice country to live in. I really wish you to go broke or alternatively to meet with the same service and rip-offs times 100000000000!,1
750,Had my holiday cancelled due to Corona virus less then 24hrs before so I cancelled my airport parking. I have been told cant get a refund as its state is T&C it must be 48hrs!!Seriously?Its not my fault flight has been cancelled less then 24hrs before.Taking money for nothing!Fuming!,1
751,Had my sidebag stolen when I was collecting my luggage had no help whatsoever from the staff present just got sent around in circle then being told they cant do anything about it even though the airport has 1000 of cameras all they had to do is check camera follow the passenger to the car park track through reg from dvla but like they give a crap would of given 0 stars but no options,1
752,The filthiest dirtiest most disorganized airport I have ever had to travel through. Total shambles in the security check to get to the gates and the trays they force you to put your personal belongings in are caked with grime. I passed through it with my family 2 days ago and if we all get Corona virus I will blame this disgraceful airport. Absolutely shocking.,1
753,This is a warning to be very careful when entering entry and exit times on line for multi storey on site parking. The Options are times of 00.05 to 23.00. I wanted to book for 23.30 exit and because there was no option I chose 00.05 and therefore should have changed my exit date to the following day....I didn't realise my mistake and was hit with an additional charge of £25 when leaving. I'm sure many people get caught out on this. I've suggested they have a midnight option or at least 11.30pm but to no avail!!!,2
754,"In Feb we arrived  & March 2020 departed via Manchester Airport [MAN].The airport in appearance is only 3/10 as it looks very tired from the airside as well as in general.  Some TLC including a coat of paint would go a long way.The airside staff were very helpful, but don't expect the same from everyone.Buses to the car rental were supposed to be every 10-15 minutes, we waited in the freezing cold for 45 mins.  When reported to the car companies it was, so what you here now attitude.On departure, we sat in a freezing cold drafty corridor as there are no real facilities for early arrival except the concession stores who don't like people taking up their facilities while waiting.  We ended up with a cold from their lack of seating for early arrivals,Once through security, the facilities were better even though some lights were out. The only problem is that you can not access these facilities and stores until you check-in and go through security.The Accessibility Assistance staff were outstanding.",2
755,"I have used Manchester Airport for a number of years and many other airports and I can confidently say that Manchester is the worst airport I have ever used. The staff in security look very unhappy and leave you with the feeling that air travellers are very much an inconvenience too them.Terminal 2 extension is a total failure as far as travellers are concerned with a lot of walking almost  3/4 of a mile to the gates with no working escalators in the walkway.Parking pick-up points are almost a mile walk and very poor egress.Baggage collection Appalling.Last night we arrived from Innsbruck and waited for almost 2hrs to collect our bags, the only lady present at the desk was not interested and totally incapable of communicating with customers to try and improve communication and was very short whenever I asked to be updated.In general staff are rude to customers, unfriendly and vertically non-existent in the crucial areas where they are needed. A lot of reliance on signage to give generic information and total lack of human contact to help customers.Serious shortfall in customer service and care.Great emphasis on extracting money out of customers with non-returnable charges for trolleys and excessive parking charges.",1
756,Why do companies delete reviews looks worse glad these don’t so 2 star not 1. Not the best experience,2
757,"I’m travelling via Manchester airport regularly, unfortunately. Most of the time, security for departure is a nightmare. All that’s been written in recent negative reviews is absolutely true in my experience. This time I thought I’d try paying for the fasttrack option to speed things up. That was a mistake. Purchasing the fasttrack ticket online already went wrong. No confirmation, no receipt, no tickets. Luckily I’d made a screenshot. That got me in the fasttrack lane.  Long story short, half an hour later I was checked. Fasttrack is a scam in my opinion.",1
758,WENT THROUGH T3 SECURITY  AND THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION OVER A. SMALL PAIR OF SCISSORS CARRIED IN THE HAND LUGGAGE. THE ISSUE WAS REFERRED UP TO A MANAGER.   My. THANKS to  ADNAN  WHO SORTED IT OUT.  I APPRECIATE THEY HAVE A DIFFICULT JOB BUT THE OFFICER ADNAN WAS VERY PROFESSIONAL AND CALMING.  THOUGHT HE DID A GRAND JOB.   WELL DONE AND THANKYOU FOR YOU PATIENCE,5
759,"Impossible to pick-up somebody from Terminal 3, as there is no pick-up area. Nobody knows where the pick-up area is in the multi-storey car park and there are signs threatening with penalties wherever you go.Ordering a taxi is no good either, as they are not allowed to stop and pick-up from where people are allowed to walk. Walkways are blocked and the access to the multi storey car park is available at levels where no parking spaces are available (elevator does not stop at level 2 where you could find parking spaces). Airport employees create more confusion by providing wrong information and the signs create more chaos than they help drivers and pedestrians.",1
760,"Just come back from a great week away to Lanzarote with Jet 2.We both found Manchester T2 great.  We were worried about the storm & that the flight may not happen.  We were kept fully in the loop with information.  Security checks were efficient with very polite staff. I have noticed that a lot of the bad reviews relate to people who don’t pay attention to what you can or cannot take through security. The security staff do have a job to do which they do very well.  I should Imagine that patience runs a little low sometimes when faced with continuous people who forgot they had something in their bag.The airport was very clean, lots of places to sit.I have flown a few times from Manchester & have never had a problem apart from customer service in boots but again that’s not all the staff.Thanks T2 for a nice time outward & return trip!",5
761,"Honestly it is the worst airport in the country, confusing layout, security and passport control are shockingly bad with very unhelpful staff. Liverpool airport is a million times better.",1
762,"Drop-off parking is just robbery wearing a uniform. I have always viewed this airport as a jewel in the crown of the North West, but they have proved to be just the same as every other rip-off's as all the other airports in the UK. This airport is just a high cost bus station. Shame on you!",1
763,It’s a poor airport but it is commonly known now. It has been losing the confidence of the City for several years now but over the last couple of years it’s hit rock bottom. It’s seems to be designed to offer an entirely dysfunctional service but charging travellers through the eye balls for the pleasure. The queues at customs are the worst I’ve experienced in any country I’ve been in. The parking situation is embarrassing and recently they lost a bag for a family member that had come over. They then had the audacity to charge us £25 to give us it back....”Admin Charge”! Diabolical place and a stain on the City.,1
764,"I know this may be strong but Manchester  really is the Worst airport I have ever been through . Rude staff in all positions and grades from security to bag searches to gate staff. Miles to walk, up and down Stairs, no or few moving walkways, .Queuing on stairs before boarding ... almost endless list.  Yes truly dreadful . And as for terminal 2 , I will never fly in out again.",1
765,"Even poor countries have better Airports, Manchester airport is no wear near the international level. looks like you entering a dirty underground metro stop, absolutely disappointed no enough spaces to sit , gates horrible organised",1
766,"A 3rd world airport:I live in the Manchester area but travel regularly to European and world destinations. Manchester Airport is consistently the worst for security, space to move, signage and a warm welcome. Manchester people are naturally friendly - but not at the Airport.I returned from Alicante, landing at 22:40 on Saturday 1st February. The flight was on time. The queues at security were horrendous. There were no queues for Europeans with ID cards, no queues for non EU travellers with passports but the queue for UK citizens was at least 20 minutes. The ""customer services"" member of staff did not have a clue - she told me to complain to my airline as my flight was obviously delayed - it wasn't.Manchester Airport is owned by local authorities and the attitude displayed by staff within the airport is one of a totally institutionalised public sector approach.There is a total lack of a coherent expansion plan - there is constant construction work  but it never seems to match capacity.Being constructive I would strongly recommend that Manchester Airport Management pay a visit to Alicante Airport and take note of the following:1) the space available to relax2) the speed through which you can navigate security3) the fact that passport control is setup to receive individual flights arriving and departing - no queues.4) the fact that security staff are actually helpful and constructive - rather than aggressively nagging you to hurry up and place things in boxes when there are either no boxes available or the conveyor has no space on which to place your box.I dread departing or arriving at Manchester and feel very fortunute that I often have a simple option to use Gatwick.",1
767,I know they've got to do checks but wow. 45 mins wait to come back into the uk. Staff aren't friendly and treat you like cattle its awful.  We are definitely going to try and fly from liverpool from now on. Come on Manchester sort yourself out. When you've got 3 or 4 arrivals open more than 3 desks. Terrible,2
768,Pick up and drop off areas are total disaster designed to rip people off the money rather than help passengers travel as easy as possible. It's all organised so illogical that anyone who get use to travel using common sense feels lost and confused. After leaving a terminal it's next to impossible to find someone to who come to pick you up (uber/frend). Pick up area is placed inside the multistorey carpark  where searching for your lift is like going through a maze. Do yourself a favour and use Liverpool airport or any other passenger welcoming place.,2
769,"just had yet another nightmare non helping assistance experience at manchester airport .always on our return they either have no chairs or nobody to push them .they pushed my 78 year old husband up to the tunnel and left him and many others saying we do not have enough staff to do this ,when asked how long was the wait was told an hour maybe.i am 75 and not brilliant on my legs so not wanting to stand and wait with no seats to sit down said i would push him.when we got not so very far with many people in front of us doing this ,we saw a gang of men and woman on there phones all collected together.my husband said when we get close to them i will ask one of them to take over as i was struggling badly,on seeing us approaching they all hurried on down a side corridor never to be seen.this is not a one off situation for many people that i have been reading there reviews they feel the same way as we do.hope these members of airport staff that are employed and described as helpers  and assistance officers are never going to be as unfortunate as we are.i rest my case hoping someone reads this .",1
770,"Help for disabled people is Abysmal. Staff are Arrogant and unhelpful. We live in Spain and come to visit family every year. But have come to dread Manchester Airport.Hubby is disabled so needs the ambulift to disembark, I could go with him but the length of time it takes is terrible, so I walk off and do the trek up stairs down stairs along loooong corridors more stairs then the cattle pens then more stairs before I reach baggage  reclaim. Then I have to wait for someone to bring my husband through, usually 30 minutes later.BUT returning home is WORSE. Daughter drops us off at terminal 2 but is told she CANNOT wait with us, So my husband has to stand surrounded by baggage while have to go get a trolley. Then he has to hobble into the terminal on crutches to get to the disabled desk.Where usually there NO wheelchairs, then 5 arrive at once but only ONE person to help. We are lucky as the Jet 2 staff help us to check in. Then I have to push the wheelchair through to passport control and then through all the shops (was lost last year) but the staff were too busy playing on their mobiles and totally disinterested.When we reached the disabled seating area no one seemed to know anything about us even though we had the correct paper workComing for our grandsons wedding in  July this year and really dreading it",1
771,Damaged my car and not accepting responsibility.I arrived back to the UK at Manchester airport in the evening so as you can expect it’s still very dark at around 9.30pm.Area where car was parked.for pick up lighting was very poor.Checked over next morning and found the damage.Tried to contact them that’s extremely difficult in itself.Two weeks on and they have now told me to read the terms and conditions.Another kop out.I’m sorry I used them but won’t make that mistake again.BEWARE,1
772,"I used this airport for a connecting flight, which I know now not to ever do again. I've been to Asia and South America and I never thought Manchester would be the one to break me.I travelled from a European city and had about an hour and thirty minutes wait in Manchester until the next one. The first flight in (Ryanair unfortunately) was ten minutes late, which shouldn't have been an issue but the problems started there. I headed towards the connecting flights sign which is next to the cattle line to passport control. I arrived at a push door, then to a lift. Two other people were with me. Then we arrived to a room which had the tarmac right outside. Signs on the wall with bus timetables, but it said that since we were outside the hours (6-13) we had to call the airline to send us a shuttle bus. No, this doesn't seem right. We all got back to arrivals where, upon asking a staff member, they tell us Ryanair has chosen not to offer a way to get to connecting flights so we have to go through passport control and security all over again. UGH. Having already done that in an airport the same day felt like a huge waste of time. But no choice.Having cleared customs, the second problematic part is finding where my flight departs from, T1. It's not in the same building as arrivals, and that building is hardly marked. I go outside and continue along the buildings until I get to departures B of terminal 1. Nope, that doesn't look right. I continue even further and finally get to T1 departures A. Success! Well, not really. Is the security in the middle for all gates? Hard to tell, but I approach. It's roped off right in front of my face. All passengers from now on have to go to the other security located across the terminal. I have to go down five flights of stairs. I see no lift. This would not be easy for the elderly or people with mobility problems. I get to security which is nearly empty with maybe three people putting their stuff on the belt. I do the same, then turn to go through the scanner but the middle-aged staff member calls me back. ""One bag per tray!"" he YELLS at me and wags a finger in my face. I am shocked. Apologise and remove the small plastic bag from the tray with my handbag. I once again attempt to go through the scanner. He calls me back yet again. ""Take off your boots!"" I oblige and remove my slim boots with a 1cm heel. I notice a girl with bulky trainers going through with them on. It's not a problem though, I just didn't think about it since the other airport the same day didn't require me to take them off. The problem is the way this man speaks to me. Now I am sure that he meets a lot of unpleasant people on a daily basis (as I am sure I can be one at times) but if I had spoken to a person that way in a customer related job (which I too have) I would be reprimanded at the very least. His attitude towards me was absolutely unacceptable. I clear the scanner but my second tray does not. There are at least 30 people waiting for staff to manually check their bags. I have NEVER seen that many bags having to be checked manually at any airport, not even large ones. I wait at least 20 minutes until it's my turn. The very polite gentleman explains that my tray was flagged because of a liquid in my coat pocket, but he checks and can't find one. It turns out my jacket pocket is lying across my closed 1 litre bag of liquids. This mistake is annoying since it takes up even more of my limited time but since the staff member was nice it still felt okay. I continue through the airport feeling grumpy because of how I was treated by the security staff member. The airport is like a maze and the gates are far away. Even the TOILETS are like a labyrinth, I kid you not. To reach my gate (26) I head towards the sign of 27, but am almost there when I notice that there is nothing between 25 and 27. I head back and see a sign pointing down a double staircase for even numbered gates. I go down and see that I have to climb an identical double staircase on the other side. Again thinking of old people who are having trouble to walk. Maybe there was a lift but I didn't see one. I arrive at the gate as the flight is boarding. It's taken me over an hour from my previous flight. Terrible.This airport has definitely put me off visiting Manchester if I have to use it to do it.",1
773,"T2 Dreadful place. As an older person who has stopped running marathons years ago, T2 is by far the most unusable airport in the world for people who are not ""disabled"" but have some mobility issues. I understand the theory of having to wind your way through duty free after the undermanned under resourced security area. and the miles of cattle fencing for check-in. I was told off for not using it even when it was empty. (we are forced to check in mega early for these reasons). We wont mention the bars full of drunks first thing in a morning. After leaving the Aspire or Escape lounges which themselves are pretty poor compared to the rest of the world. The walk to the gates is several hundred yards at least, too much for families and the elderly and as yet the walkway has never been working. (its only short anyway) I have been there when the lifts were not working either. So unless you set off to the gate the instant is shows on the screens you will be late and incur the wrath of rude ground staff. The sit down on the aircraft is most welcomed IF you don't have to wind round steps and up steps to the aircraft. this is too much for some people and very definitely a security risk, that is another story. Don't mention special assistance, it takes forever, no staff, no chairs, wrong size etc, etc. plus it precludes you from having an extra legroom seat, and we are the people in most need of the legroom.Coming back is something to be feared, it is over 1 kilometer from the gate to the pick-up point and even for able bodied people dragging cases and children is a very long way. Landed at 14:05 today and it was over 1 hour 40 minutes before we were on our way and most of that was walking. blistered feet exhausted. It is an extra 30 minutes by car to Liverpool for us so we would have been home before we even left Manchester airport. I travel very regularly and have been to 73 countries in my life so I have some airport knowledge. Never again, the architects need shooting. I understand the available footprint and the budget constraints but the most terrible place in the world to travel from/toPaul Johnson MIoD MIoEx RE",1
774,"Would give no stars if I could. Collecting my nephew as I have done 3 times per year at T3 arrivals for the last 4 years, I pilled in through the new route. Drove in through the barrier, saw my nephew and pulled up to collect him at the drop off point, 15 seconds later I’m driving off to the barrier. Stopped at the barrier and put my card to the contactless sensor - the barrier won’t go up - I pressed the button for help to be told I have to pay £100 as I’ve collected. I asked if the guy was joking. He said no it’s £100 because you have picked up, it’s £ 4 if you drop off, I asked again if he was joking, then realised he wasn’t, I asked if it was a parking charge or a fine for something I’d done wrong, he did not answer straight away and then when he did answer I could hear someone talking to him in the background, he said if you pay it now I can reduce it to £25. I said £25 for a 15 seconds stop this is a RIP OFF. I asked where it tells me it’s £100 to collect he said all of the posts have a small sign stating it’s £100 for collecting. Signs which you cannot see.from your vehicle when driving - you can’t stop cos it’s all double yellow and double red before the barriers. - Profiteering at its best - I will never use this airport again!",1

Baggage collection was also OK.The problem was the journey to the designated taxi pickup point  West Car Park. It was more than 300 metres over poorly surfaced ground, some or which was not under cover from the weather, dragging heavy bags. On arrival at the pickup point, it was gridlocked for over 30 mins, so passengers we left out in the cold breathing car fumes. We asked our driver why and  he put it down to the airport 30 minute charge policy. Taxis wait clear of the airport until passengers signal their arrival and then drive to the pickup point at around the same time....hence gridlock on entering and leaving the car park. This was a reasonably quiet time early Sunday morning in early December, goodness know what this will be like in peak times....... My advice is DO NOT USE this airport unless you absolutely have to.",1

This really needs sorting out. Nearly every airport gives you 15 mins free to pick up or drop of, get it sorted Manchester",1

We had one man telling us the bus was full, yet another yelling at people to get on because there was space. There was no space whatsoever. To say we were crammed on like sardines would be an understatement. As my mother has a disability this treatment forced her into an uncomfortable situation and actually caused her pain. Late night flight, so people obviously are tired and can be grumpy. Forcing us all into the small bus, which was clearly not adequate for an entire plane full of people, arguments did occur on the short ride. Overall absolutely pathetic with some incompetent, and quite frankly rude, staff members.

The terminal 3 security is the slowest I have ever witnessed there was only around 10 people in the queue and it took 60 minutes to get through as they were searching 50% of the hand luggage without any reason given (just a swan of the inside).

791,"I am an elderly gentleman and I admit I was confused by the parking at Terminal 3 when dropping off my granddaughter. I was polite to the man in the fluorescent jacket and bullet proof vest (on a parking attendant?), but I was subjected to sarcasm, rudeness and intimidation. Is this the way the airport treats its customers? And I  had to pay for this abuse as I was charged at the exit gate.",1
792,£90 for 29 hours parking. Rip off. Struggled to get into my car due to small spaces and two range rovers either side .,1
793,"Worst airport ever.415 people fly in from Atlanta, plane gets sent to furthest gate from immigration as is possible, then small single carousel for luggage, 6 deep at times.",1
794,"As a frequent flyer from Manchester to Orlando over 15 years , I have finally concluded that I will now be flying from Gatwick instead . I’m absolutely sick of arriving back with ample baggage , yet not a single person to assist me . To make matters worse , the trolley machines are regularly out of service and there are never any staff to speak to .I go from fabulous service in Orlando , where there are plenty of porters with huge trolleys to assist me , and plenty of customer service personnel to help if necessary , to zero of each Manchester end . Shocking considering that this is an international airport with such a volume of customers .",1
795,"I have several complaints. Firstly, when we went through baggage scan, my husband put his jacket, travel bag & iPad in a black tray. He was ""stopped"" as usual (75 years old), but I do appreciate the need for security. He wore canvas shoe (no buckles)but had to sit with his feet in the air. I collected my belongings & his from the trays. But it seems that the young boy at the beginning of the belt had removed the iPad into a separate tray, after we passed through & did not tell us he was doing so. Consequently I collected our things - but NOT the iPad. Didn't realise until flying. Reported it to the stewardess who said that she would put it in her report. Landed home 7.30p.m on 7/11after delay in landing,& dashed to Lost Property which closed at 8.p.m. It was 7.53 , but she said that she had to cash up & there was no time to check for me. I asked for a phone No. - but she didn't know it & had to ring someone & also couldn't give me an email address. Phoned next day & spoke to a lovely young man (Jamie) - T2 the only reason I gave this 2 stars ! He was so helpful & arranged for me to pay the storage & courier fees(£45). However, he did say that there were 15 iPads in lost property. Can't imagine these would have been left on seats - so makes you think that the same thing is happening to other people i.e being moved to separate trays & then in the melee, people walking off without them. I know that there is a lot of ongoing work at the airport - but on our outward journey, we had to walk along temporary corridors to get to the plane. There was a sign overhead saying that this would be a 20 min walk!! Had we have known, I would have asked for assistance in advance for my husband, as he leg circulation problems & has to stop often because of the pain . There was just one moving walkway which was working & we had to watch out for chairs or something for him to sit on  to rest..... took us about 35 mins. Similarly, on returning home at T2, it was torrential rain & there was a long temporary walkway to the car park - not covered over. Everyone was soaking wet & complaining. Will avoid Manchester until Autumn 2020, when the work should be finished.",2
796,"We have just had a bill for £646.10 to repair damage to our car which 'happened' whilst it was left in the care of T3 Meet & Greet. The car was left with them in full working order, but returned with a key fob that said 'engine malfunction, 20mph only'. We found that the air system was not working. When we challenged about it the manager eventually came to see us. He acknowledged that the car had been left in full working condition, but that it was just one of those things that 'happened' to go wrong without their fault. He then informed us that the car had had to be jump started, though he denied that they had left lights or engine on. Strange for such a new car! Anyway, it appears that somehow the heater motor had been burnt out. On a more cosmetic note, the wheels were covered in mud, and the drivers footwell full of light coloured grit. All signs of a car that has not been looked after at all well. This is the most we have ever spent on airport parking, over £100 before we got this extra bill. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS. Manchester Airport's own parking is the worst we have ever experienced.",1
797,Worst airport - I’m embarrassed to say I’m from Manchester. The charges are disgusting for dropping people off there to fly... I had no idea that I had to pay and I’d left the house at 5am to drop off my daughter without any money or cards... as I left the drop off point I was mortified that I didn’t have £3 to exit. When I called through to the attendant I was greeted with a barrage of sarcastic comments and made to feel like I was trying to get away with paying!!!! This isn’t my only negative experience of this airport... queues at passport control  when I landed back in August after a long flight. It was chaos and took over an hour to get through.The security checks and staffing are a joke - There’s never enough staff and takes forever ( at all terminals). Their customer service skills are also non existent. This airport leaves me with a very sour taste in my mouth.,1
798,"Manchester mid stay car park is a nightmare to walk to/from, poorly signed, no cover, area surrounding it is a building site.",1
799,"Staff from check in and bag-drop through to security have been amazing! The first time I have ever seen security staff smile, its not the most enjoyable of experiences but they made it fast, efficient and most of all friendly! Rosa in particular stood out with her smile, calm and collected and highly organised manner! Cant fault the staff I have met today.",5
800,Drop off is planned very badly and is a rip off. Worst airport I've been to on the 3 continents I've visited,1
801,"The baggage is always delayed, we waited for an hour for the bags to arrive on the 26th Oct, Jet 2 flight from Tenerife. I asked the Jet2 rep and she said it had something to do with the airport laying off baggage handlers. It isn't goo enough, if you pay to have your bags in the hold, then part of that service is to get them back to you in a reasonable time. We have had this before and it seems and common problem. We have flown from Liverpool and they seem much better- maybe we should just use this airport in future. The car parking at Manchester airport/ taxis/ delays is a complete mess. I really don't like using this airport any longer!",1
802,this is a RIP OFF BRITON company charging for trolleys(first time i have ever come across an airport charging money for trolleys and even 30 seconds for a car park is charged). horrible service at every point with immigration queues as long as 60 mins most of the time i pass through.,1
803,"I have travelled around the world on a number of occasions and find Manchester Airport as by far the worst, escalators that do not work, travelators that have been installed but never operated, flight gates that are situated miles away from the main terminal with no obvious offer of help to customers.The whole area is dirty. Travelling through passport control is very stressful due to the number of points unmanned, as mentioned in an earlier reviews - I counted 10 available desks with only 4 manned, some customers were called out as their flights were boarding.The latest con that I have noticed on a number of visits is the delays in collecting baggage when arriving at the airport (this happened to 2 flights from Alicante on my recent visit) I enquired to a member of staff about the delay and he said that I should complain to the baggage reclaim department - It was situated at the furthest point away from the baggage collection and as I was still waiting for my bags I did not have the time to make the visit. Surely this desk should be sited nearer to were the complaints arise - at the collection point?When we finally got our cases off the carousel after waiting for 50 mins we were then presented with a higher car parking fee for parking. Yet another result for Manchester Airport in their quest to rip people off.",1
804,"Beware! £25 for dropping paying passengers off, couple minutes over 5 minutes!! and they hit you with this extortion. No obvious warning signs!  Manchester is the worst uk airport, use Leeds or Liverpool instead.",1
805,"Yes I made a mistake picking up in drop off point. Yes there’s signs saying drop off but not don’t pickup. Yes the “helpful traffic Marshall” came over and said don’t pick up here. I said I won’t do it again and said sorry. Being the helpful traffic Marshall, he didn’t warn me of any fines just don’t pickup here?? We went to the barrier to pay the £3 and was charged £100!!! We asked the guy on the speaker what the problem was and was told we had picked up and it dropped off! We told him of our conversation with the traffic Marshall and he said it’s nothing to do with him as we have been picked up on camera? I thought it was another only? Yes we made a mistake and told the guy this. He then quickly dropped it to £25 if we paid there and then!Following all that’s gone on with parking at the airport. This unhelpful and non advisory actions by the drop off people at terminal 3 is nothing other than wrong. If he had warned I’d be fined, my family would have got out and I’d have gone to the right location. Very very unprofessional Manchester airport group, especially when air travel is under so much pressure.",1
806,have not used this airport for a few years until recently when travelling to Cyprus from terminal one check in with jet2. was excellent but on going thro security it was complete chaos no organization  queues crossing over and completely traveller unfriendly infact i would now considering travelling to Birmingham if flights required are not available from Liverpool which is the best airport in the north west but unfortunately has limited destination about time Manchester got its act together to makea travelling experience more enjoyable,2
807,"Really bad airport. You need to set your luggage your self. No staff enough. Luggage room service was not working we were waiting more than 30 minutes with ""priority board pass"". After that in the security guys was really rude with my wife. She was travelling alone with a bit English languages skill, but they are were laughing on her why she do not understand the stupid process that they request. She has been around the world many times that that was the first bad experience for her.  Then they taken her creme and make-ups with useless cause. Everything it was one liquid bag less then 100 ml ,but they do not care. Next to the other lady was able to bring 2 liquid bags. Highly recommend to choose other airports.",1
808,Poor Airport Not enough staff in bars and restaurants Restaurant tables dirtySecurity is a free for all,1
809,Great airport serving the Northern Powerhouse. Has transformed Manchester for the better,5
810,Absolutely fantastic staff. Was travelling to Germany on Friday and was just about to board my flight when I realised we were in the wrong terminal. In the panic we found a staff member who led us back up the security desk. The staff behind the desk were baffled as to how we managed to get through the wrong terminal but didn’t waste any time solving the problem. Even though our flight gate was closing imminently the staff rushed us onto a bus and across to the correct terminal. We ran to our flight and made it by the skin of our teeth. It looked a certainty we would miss our flight and not be able to travel but the staff at Manchester airport went the extra mile to make sure we travelled. Fair play lads.,5
811,"Picked my daughter t2 last thurs , nightmare!!  Theres nowhere to park nearby whilst waiting for flight, tracked plane so I knew time of arrival. I kept on going round the roundabouts till I got phone call saying she was on her way out, so I headed for t2 pickups, it took my daughter at least 10 mins for her to walk to pick up point, I had to go in the multi story park to pick up, £4.50 is the least payment, at least mr turpin wore a mask!! It was bedlam in that car park , lots of people wandering around , cars all over the place, a nightmare!!  Picked up my daughter then headed to the exit barriers,  with £4.50in cash only to find its card only, never saw any signs to that effect, luckily my daughter had a contact card, then off we went !!  What an expensive shambles.  M mcguinness.",1

813,"Terminal 3 at Manchester Airport is a disgrace.  We arrived at the Airport well above 2 hours  before our planned departure. First of all Terminal 3 is not easy to find. The security people treated us very badly, they were rude to us, they even confiscated the food for our baby. My wife does not speak English so she could not defend herself, while I was taken into a separate room for some reason . I explained we would miss our flight because it was so time consuming. We were really harassed. In the end we arrived at the gate and were not allowed on our Ryanair flight to Hamburg, although they had time to retrieve our luggage from the plane. The baby was upset and crying, she was hungry but we had no food for her. The staff at Ryanair were also not helpful at all, they even gave the impression they enjoyed sending us away. They have absolutely no idea about customer care. I phoned Ryanair twice but no one offered us any help. I went onto the live chat but just got a recorded message. The Ryanair flights were not cheap after paying for all the extras. In future I will fly with Lufthansa even though it means changing in Frankfurt or Munich. We have a baby and no one at all tried to help us. A very terrible experience.",1
814,"Unbelievably bad.Firstly make sure you leave twice as much time to get through terminal 3 security , as you would a any other airport .it is badly organised and confusing . The staff are ‘nonedescript’ in attitude , which may indicate that they are not happy working in this awful place .i have flown out of many European airports in the last year , and wonder why are they so much better in security in Spain and Poland . The staff need to be just as vigilant and rigorous, so what is the problem here In ‘Little Britain’.The terminal itself is vastly over crowed with a couple of mediocre overpriced eateries , which double as bars , making it almost impossible to get a seat to eat at sometimes. The odd circular bar area , which could be named ‘chav Central ‘ by the number of them sitting drinking copious amounts of beer is horrible . It is quieter out by the gates, with more seats, but very limited facilities by today’s standards",1
815,"The most illogical airport I have thus far encountered, coming from someone who has been to a fair share of airports in the last few months. I have had a rather unpleasant first experience with Manchester Airport T3 today. My main qualm with this airport is the absolute haphazard nature in which it is laid out. Right from entering the terminal building, where there is not a single clear indications of where departures are (there is only a sign for check in and a sign for security). Only when you climb up the stairs in this dimly lit area, which looks as though you are going to some desolate room, do you see the big departures sign. Whoever designed the airport seemed to think it was more important to fit ""prayer room"" after ""check in"" on the sign rather than ""depatures"". Perhaps the confusion is my fault and other people have understood this fine but I'd like to point out that in most airports, check in and general departures are in two separate areas.The security area of the airport is so badly disorganised that it's downright confusing. Instead of a clear distinct areas of security (queue, tray area, body scanner, collect items), everything seems to be interspersed throughout the room. The only way I can describe the queues themselves is like a squiggle. There is no order and you can not see where the start or end of the queue is, because it would turn around corners and bend and move this way and that. Perhaps this design was to maximise space but all it did was maximise confusion, which then further required security workers to constantly shout at people in the queue- that famed Northern spirit was lacking in this airport it seems. The worst was yet to come however. This airport seems not to center itself around the actual gates but rather the measly selection of restaurants and shops. The gates are simply an addition it seems to this collection of shops. To clarify, what I mean is that the gates are placed randomly over the airport and all roads seem to lead to this stupid circular bar thing in the middle, an area which is so crowded that you cannot make head or tail of which way you have to go for which gate. This is an airport may I remind you, not a shopping mall.Another major problem with this airport is the sheer lack of boards. In that main circle area I couldn't even find one board to tell me which gate I was going to. Of course, I would have known my gate if the board in the lounge was working (it said ""boarding now"" next to my flight without actually providing the gate number) or if woman at the lounge desk would have told me correctly, instead of telling me a gate number which didnt even exist in the airport. As an airport lounge, you are supposed to provide a service that is not offered in the rest of the airport and in many airport lounges they tell you the gate number as you enter the lounge / shout it out on the PA. Instead of providing me an extra service, my journey was hindered.So next time you're booking a flight to Manchester T3, please leave yourselves a good 5 hours to have time to wrap your head around the confusion or just save yourself the bother and pay a bit of extra money to fly somewhere else.",1
816,"Manchester airport is a complete disgrace. Terminal 3 is revolting. Putting aside for a moment the exorbitant parking/drop off fees, the airport itself is filthy and disastrously managed. Security is truly beyond the pale. Half of the baggage that travels through the scanner gets put to one side. This includes my partners bag which was literally empty, as he has removed his laptop. The consequence of this was an hours wait for the empty bag to be re-examined. We missed out on the lounge we had paid for and barely made our flight.I have never been to any other airport where security is so badly handled. Customers are treated like cattle. There are not nearly enough staff to examine every other bag which gets put to one side. The staff that are there clearly despise their jobs and the customers. This airport is an embarrassment to Manchester.",1
817,"A void like the plague , queues for drinks are horrendous. Treat you like cattleNever enough staff on",1
818,"Travelling out on 10/9/19 I had booked a lounge to make a nice relaxing start to my family’s holiday, and a chance to eat breakfast before our long haul flight. To go along with this I also paid for fast track security to get to the lounge quicker.We all followed the lane to fast track security , my daughter went first and was Indeed fast tracked by a member of staff who saw her with her bar coded paper work.The other three of us were forced to waiting line , no explanation as to why. We  were in ine behind a couple who had a lot of medication bottles etc that were being examined. I evetualy got called forward by a security man by pointing for me to go through scanner, at the same time a lady in a wheelchair was going through the normal metal detector type arch alongside of me. My scan was done, the guy immediately stepped forward to block my path out of the scanner and he just said ‘Stay there’ at first I took no notice, thinking wrongly that it was because they were having to check the ladies wheel chair and didn’t want me in the way. All the time the guy was just blocking my way, not speaking or explaining just staring at me. I was standing there for quite a few minutes, with everyone in the queue just watching me, no doubt a lot of them thinking I was a smuggler or worse !Still thinking it was nothing to do with me, I started wondering if the scanner had a fault or something, so I asked the guy ‘Is there’s problem’ ? He did not reply at all just continued to stare at me, I began to find this very intimidating. I am a short, middle aged woman and he was a tall well built younger man. my family had all gone through and I was being forced to stand in a scanner on display to other travellers. I asked him again what the problem was, and told him I need to use the toilet which was a fact, that I shouldn’t have to tell a stranger !Yet again he didn’t speak to me, so I had to repeat the need my need for he toilet, fearing I would do it there and then !Still no reply but this time he spoke to a female officer who called me out of the scanner and told me to sit on a chair.  She at least was polite and spoke to me, she then checked me with a hand held device and it showed a positive reading, I imagined that it was caused by a metal biopsy clip left in my breast as marker for future tests, so explained this to her. She said it wasn’t that, so just what was the problem a bra wire, a metal button? No, the cardi that I had thrown on as I usually get cold on flights had got a few lurex thread in it. I realised about the same time a the femAle officer and we both said at the same time, it’s the cardigan. She then said ‘He should have asked you to take it off’ I was then allowed to leave. By the time we got to the lounge we didn’t have much time to eat or relax at all before going to our gate. So a waste of money for fast track when only my daughter actually got fast tracked, and the lounge visit as it was too short a visit to relax, plus my family were worried as why I was being held in a scanner.I fully appreciate that security is very,very important and necessary in the times we live in, and feel reassured by it personally. I do however feel that staff should treat people with respect and be polite. I was at no point rude or impolite, and feel that I could have least been told that there was a problem that needed further investigation.I also feel that doing the job he does, the presence of shiny gold threads in my cardi would have made him think that could be the problem.These people only have jobs because the paying public spend many thousands of pounds on air travel, we can however choose the airports we fly from in the majority of cases, so that is exactly what I shall do in future a get my long haul flights from Heathrow.For the record, the security on my return flight from the states was a much better experience. They are very thorough, but polite and will speak decently to you.I feel some of Manchesters staff need a little more customer service training, as I assume the vast majority of people they screen every day are just like me, nothing at all to hide  we are not criminals, smugglers or terrorists so please do us the courtesy of treating us as human beings.",1
819,"Unnecessarily rough security check. My small carry-on and handbag were pulled over, emptied out on the counter; wallet, medicines, everything. In the process they dropped things on the floor and lost my dental retainers. My husband waited on the side for 30 minutes. Everything was dumped back into bins for me to repack. I appreciate security and, sad to say, it is important these days. But I had my properly sized liquids and gels in clear bags and my medications clearly marked with prescription attached. There was no reason  for such rough treatment of my bags, even if necessary to look through them again. Makes me doubly appreciative of all the other airports I’ve travelled through.",2

824,"I flew from Manchester airport on 09/09/19 with my partner to the Dominican Republic as it was a direct flight. We prepaid for extra baggage allowance but I was charged an extra £85 for excess baggage as the case was a couple of kgs overweight. I did not have a credit card so my partner paid on his card and the suitcase went on his ticket and I took his baggage on my ticket. We arrived in Punta Cana after a 9 hour flight but the bag we paid extra for did not. It was reported to a representative and he completed a form. Eventually after numerous phone calls we were told the case was still in Manchester and would be on the next flight which was Friday - 4 days later. The case eventually arrived but had a ticket in the handle saying that it had been X-rayed and examined. I opened it and found that my luggage had been rifled through and my Amazon Alexa and it’s cable had been stolen along with 2 bottles of perfume, my hairdryer and some other toiletries. No one actually wants to take responsibility now.

825,Booked parking at Jet park 3 - cost £90 for 11 days.  (A lot lot more than it used to be).  fortunately arrived earlier than we had planned - drove round to nearly half an hour before we found a parking space - and that was at the furthest point from the entrance. Lots of other people having the same problem - we followed the bus in the end and waited for someone to get off!!! Only counted 2 empty spaces as we left the car park on the transfer bus and at least 10 cars coming in!!!  No indication of where empty spaces were.  Arrived back at 2.30am  We'd noted down which row we were parked in but so dark could not actually see out of the bus windows to see the numbers on the rows. Fortunately remember the number of the bus stop and managed to see that in the dark Bus driver NOT HELPFUL .

Cabin crew indicated that we would exit via L/H front door & steps were pushed to the aircraft almost straight away. Cabin door was opened, but we were told that we would have to wait for a bus to transport us to main terminal building.  There was no bus available !  Cabin crew(including pilot) & ground crew indicated that a shortage of available buses to transport passengers was common place for night time arrivals at Manchester. In fact I have suffered this before at Manchester with a similar arrival time.Bus finally arrived at 02:20. We then used soaking wet steps to exit the aircraft & board the bus--hazardous when people are carrying bags or children !!This is a clear failure of the airports management structure, to ensure that there are  sufficient buses/staff to transport CUSTOMERS back to the terminal without delay.This is a further example of how poor the service is at Manchester Airport.

833,"Ive used Manchester twice this year for long and short haul flights. Terminal 3 was the grimiest airport lounge I've ever used. if you enjoy being surrounded by beer swilling, tracksuit wearing yobs then this is the place for you. The sooner they restrict alcohol to obviously drunk rowdy people the better. Very intimidating and uncomfortable place to be. Not suitable for families. I used Terminal 2 for long haul. The security check can claim the nearest I've felt to being arrested and thrown in a cell. It was chaotic, and after my hand luggage got rejected for a dry inhaler (hands up my error) I was put through a humiliating and total unnecessary amount of abuse by some steroid pumped up half trained thug who had been given a security badge. I was intimidated and ridiculed by this man in front of the entire section including other passengers. He was overly aggressive, which I could only put down to what looked like steroid abuse. The process took 45 mins. Why? because of my Apple head-phones and a travel book. He offered no apology. We all want efficient, thorough security checks, but there is absolutely no excuse to treat passengers this way, totally unacceptable. I would recommend avoiding Manchester airport at all cost.",1

Being frequent travellers, why did we continue to use it?  It was close to our home and has a good choice of destinations.  Those are the only positives. It is a rarity to find staff who are pleasant, security and passport control are frequently a nightmare, moving walkways and escalators are regularly not working, cases have to be carried up and down stairs with no obvious option to use a lift.  Signage is confusing and it is not uncommon for there to be a long wait for a taxi. We were used to it but I often wondered what foreign visitors make of it. A poor welcome to the U.K. Ironically, there used to be a large sign on arrival stating that Manchester had once been voted Britain’s favourite airport. That must have been a long time ago. We have now moved and are finding Bristol, Gatwick and even Heathrow to be a joy. I commented to one person in security that it was a change to have someone pleasant doing the job. He said, “All I said was good morning”. “Precisely”, I replied. Little things can make a big difference, Manchester!",2
835,Truly awful experience completely useless incompetent staff who do not care one bit,1
836,"I had to drop my daughter at the airport as she was moving abroad & therefore had a lot of luggage. I was quite willing to park in the car park and pay for a longer stay. However, the car park was closed for departures, and therefore I had to park in the drop off area; not ideal with 3 large cases! By the time I had helped her to the check-in, said a tearful goodbye and returned to the car as quickly as I could, I was met by an angry 'Parking Steward'. When I hastily left, I had a charge of £25; yes that is £25, for 11 minutes! The staggering stupidity of the management of this airport is beyond words. The people running this shambolic organisation have absolutely people skills, no understanding of travellers needs and not a clue about customer service. I will be using Liverpool Airport in the future, as will all my family.",1
837,I am fortunate to be a regular flyer but would never choose Manchester following a series of bad experiences here.,2
838,"Terminal 3 looks like the end of cattle drive. The worst check-in and hospitality ever. Even small non-European airports are better. No clear directions. Totally overcrowded (Sunday's afternoon). The only place to wait like a human being was parfumes shop. During security check-in the staff  requires to slide (close) a foil bag with a small parfumes bottle saying that regulation requires sliding (sic!). Finally the staff also had a problem to do this. Immediately after - no place to sit, no place to stand.Want to use airport internet you have to give all your private details (they only not asking about your pets).The airport is simply saying out of European civilisation.One star for this place is even too much. Much better to use Liverpool!",1
839,"45 minute wait at passport control to come through, 30 minute wait for case, BACK TO THE OLD DAYS, Rubbish",1
840,"Overall disappointed1) They have an extremely strict hand luggage policy, the bag i have been traveling with on Numerous trips(even on the airline I was flying with) was considered too big hence had to be checked it, given that most people take luggage close to capacity this is an extra BIG bill that passengers have to cough up.2)The entrances of Departures(over 2 floors) is unclear.",2
841,"Even having booked Special Assistance, but left to ourselves after check-in, it took 30 minutes to get through security in a wheelchair and I ended up being ill. My companion told the staff that I had become ill whilst my bag was in the queue to be searched and was told that there was no proof of that and I would have to wait.  Luckily my companion is a Doctor and told them so and that if I didn't get food and water very soon I would collapse. It seemed like every single bag was being pulled to be searched.  The queues were unbelievable at security, I have never seen anything like it, and believe it would have taken an hour or more to get through. Lots of small children having to stand for all that time in hot, cramped conditions.This is the worst airport I have ever used and will pay extra to not have to ever use it again.",1
842,"Just dropped my son off at T1 followed exit signs to get out, attempted to pay the rip off fee of £3 with a card but it was so dark with a small light could not see any instructions regarding which buttons to press, after several attempts eventually paid cash. Having arrived home I spoke to my son, who has just said that the food outlets closed and he has paid £7.30 for 2 bags of crisps and an orange juice",2
843,We booked Platinum Meet and Greet Manchester operated by Manchester Airport Parking Ltd via Smart Travel Deals. WHAT A NIGHTMARE!!We had booked this from 11.30am 4th August. The paperwork said to ring and give 30 mins notice of arrival. I rang at 10.55 to say we would be there at 11.30 and was told there would no one there then but to drive round until we got a call from the driver to say he was at the airport drop off. How difficult is it to “just drive round” !! How ridiculous! I asked why wouldn’t there be someone there at 11.30 as that was the time I’d booked and paid for. I was told they were short-staffed! We got a call at 11.38 from the driver saying he was in the T2 car park drop off area. We drove in and took all our cases and bags out of the car and waited. After 4 frantic calls - with the driver saying he was there but couldn’t see us and us waving to attract his attention - we had to exit the car park as he had gone to T 2 West car park - which he never told us and wasn’t on the paperwork. THIS COST US £25 EXIT FEE! We rang the driver again who said he’d walked over to T 2 main car park and told us to drive back to the entrance not go in and he would collect the car from there - which we did as it was past 12 by now. We were worried that we may get a parking fine as we had stopped on yellow lines when the driver took our car. He said we would have to take it up with the office about getting the £25 back.ON OUR RETURN IT GOT WORSE!On collecting our case we rang at 10.55pm and - yet again - was told it would be 30-40 minutes before our car would be returned. I asked which car park as the paperwork stated T2 level B - he said was T2West level 0 - good job we asked!After 55 mins we rang and was told 3-4 mins 20 mins later rang again told 15-20 mins. This went on and on... I went to airport security who couldn’t help so I rang the airport police who said “they were cowboys” and “ this happens on a daily basis” they rang the meet and greet and rang me back to say they would be there in 10-15 mins. 35 mins later - AT 1.30AM - AFTER WAITING TWO AND A HALF HOURS - our car came. We asked why it was all wet as it wasn’t raining the driver said he had just given it a quick wash as it was very dirty! We asked why it was dirty but he didn’t answer. There was mud inside also.  We asked where the base was and again he didn’t say. IT HAD OBVIOUSLY BEEN PARKED IN A FIELD FOR A WEEK. The driver said he had just started his shift SO ALL THE MESSAGES ABOUT WHEN OUR CAR WOULD  ARRIVE WERE LIES!ABSOLUTELY DISGRACEFUL! Sent numerous emails to them - still waiting for the £25 and an apology. WHY DOES MANCHESTER AIRPORT PARKING LTD ALLOW PEOPLE LIKE THIS TO ADVERTISE ON THEIR WEBSITE??!THIS SPOILED OUR HOLIDAY!,1
844,"We traveled through Manchester airport yesterday ,  it’s an absolute mess...out of date, difficult to get through at every point.  We dropped off a hire car, then went looking for a trolley to get our bags to the shuttle bus (I have two children, one in a pram). There was nothing to be found so we dragged the pram and bags across a very bumpy pavement for a fair distance moving one bag a few feet then returning to move the next bag etc...we boarded the bus (fortunately the driver was helpful) .we  Arrived at the terminal, again searched for a trolley...again! Nothing.  Once again. We had to drag bags one by one in convoy.  Then security!  What a mess..we stood in line for about an hour, bags were “timing out” and had to be re scanned, people were being trained so it was like life in slow slow motion...extremely painful and annoying experience in every possible way...I was exhausted with frustration by the time we boarded our flight...I advise you to avoid this airport if possible ...it’s like a third world experience",1
845,"We arrived at the airport 3.40am for a 6am flight haven driven from Glasgow. I had booked special assistance for my Daughter and father. When I went to the desk they said they were closed and to go to security explain that and we would be helped through. Nothing could be further from the truth. My daughter has autism and therefore security its the most difficult part of the whole journey as she needs to be screened but is scared. The man at the entrance looked at me as if I had three heads when I explained so after a debate we just went through and when we got to the xrays this woman grabbed my daughter from me and dragged her through a machine leaving me on the other side! All whilst I was trying to explain to her and get my dad through first to then take my daughter whilst I got through. As you can imagine my daughter was upset and I was very angry! I asked for a manger who was no help at all whats so ever. What infuriates me is that the airport advertises its self as autism friendly and this is far from the truth. Travelling is one of the most difficult things you can do with an autistic child and I would seriously consider planning well ahead if you are looking to do so from Manchester as I will not be using this airport again I am afraid the poor service, rude staff and uneducated/trained staff is shocking in today's world.",1
846,"T1 arrivals Car Park Chaos.Used this for the first time yesterday to meet some  family.1. Poor approach  SignageAirport managers have failed to learn from courses that are available that instruct in how to make  signage that is helpful and useful: Position, Careful  use of language, consistent terminology ,avoid ambiguity,  colour consistency etc.The impression is of temporary “add-on “ signage that becomes permanent by default.2. Problems  relating to the   entry barrier and token system -Again , primarily down to a poor or non-existent signage:There are signs that say that payment “must be made before exit” but no clear indication of how you are to do this.The system relies on driving up to the barrier  which opens after a moment or two to allow  entry and an orange token appears in a holder. Although it might be obvious to many that the procedure is to take the token with you and later insert it into a payment machine, many first time users will delay following vehicles whilst they stare at the puzzling machine and what to do.3 Dangerous congestion.Problems of exiting the car park.There were three competing lines of vehicles trying to exit the busy car park.One barrier was out of order.It took 15 minutes to exit the car park.The delays were causing  obvious frustration and anger with drivers tooting and shouting.Drivers sought to change lanes to seek advantage.Their maneuvering, particularly reversing, created a very obvious danger as there are   no designated pedestrian walkways.The danger for small children is obvious as they and their parents and luggage trolleys weave between the cars.Conclusion:The car park system is a chaotic muddle that is not only expensive and frustrating to use but its poor design and management is dangerous and I think it  will result in pedestrian injury and this victim is likely to be a child.- I do hope I am wrong.",1
847,"I can only echo the many negative comments on here about how bad Manchester is. The new charges for dropping off and picking up passengers are nothing short of an extortion racket the mafia would be proud of. Added to this, the appalling lack of signage and total chaos on site because of the new building work, and it creates a horrible stressful atmosphere. If you didn’t need a holiday before you go, you certainly do after two or three hours in this national disgrace that masquerades under the name of an “airport”. Self-service check in desks are awful, while the terminal buildings are over crowded, dirty and hopeless for facilities such as toilets. The real low point though is security. There are nowhere near enough staff or facilities for the number of customers and most of the staff they do have are poorly trained, stressed and over worked, rendering it a vile experience for all concerned. They do additional hand  checks on far too many carry on bags and clearly cannot cope. There is utterly no excuse for shouting at passengers, or for the rudeness and attitude so many of the security staff display, particularly the supervisors. There is no consistency from security staff either. The friend I was travelling with was told to put all electronic goods, including his electric tooth brush, in a tray, while I was told only lap tops or iPads were needed. I had a lengthy wait for my carry on luggage to be hand inspected and for twenty minutes or so it was out of sight and I had no idea of it was in a queue or had been stolen. It turned out to be just a random check as nothing in my bag had required any additional inspection. By the time we got through check in and fast track security (!), we were stressed to hell. Passport control is almost as bad on return; under staffed and atrociously organised by sullen and rude customer helpers! You then have the delight of being herded a long way to pay an additional rip off charge for your taxi to pick you up. I leave my final comments to those of one of the airport staff I chatted to who totally agreed it was a horrible airport to fly from and that it gets worse by the year!",1
848,"Good airport to travel to & from. Always get through security reasonably quickly. Can find my way around easily enough. Good selection of shops, food places & bars.",5
849,"We arrived at terminal 2 two and half hours before our flight, security was absolutely terrible we stood in a queue for over 2 hours as they only had 2 desks open for bag scanning. We had no time to eat drink or even go the toilet before the flight as we literally had to run through the airport to the departure gate. I found this so unprofessional for an airport of this size and at the most busiest time of year! I certainly wont be travelling through this airport again",1
850,"I have used Manchester airport mid/long stay many times in past without complaint but last weekends trip was unacceptable.not only had the price increased but when we arrived we found the carpark was a building site. managed to find a spot after driving down every line of cars at the far end of carpark and then walked to exit which consisted of a dirt track next to the exit barrier. then discovered that the shuttle service appeared to have been discontinued, no sign of bus stops or buses.we then had to walk for about 10 to15 mins to reach T1 departures whilst dragging heavy suitcases. why was none of this mentioned during booking?",1
851,1.5 hrs for checkin and security. Boiling hot inside. Unclear security instructions (my and loooots of other bags were checked without specifying what i should have put outside to avoid further delay). Narrow walkways.At arrival: superslow passport control. Half hr waiting for the bags.One of the worst airport i have used.,1
852,"I am going to stick my neck out and say 4 stars, simply because the airport is what it is. It will be a long time before it gets like other major UK airports, and you have to build that into your expectations.  Parking and drop off will frustrate you but the costs are clearly displayed, just allow plenty of time, Meet and Greet is the least stressful if you can afford it, and the quickest to the terminal. There will sometimes be long queues for check-in, You will hate security, and make sure you empty everything out of your bag, and even then you may still get pulled up. Just expect that, and when you don't get pulled up, then happy days.  Food will be very expensive, toilets are less than clean (although they are improving), buy fastrack if you can afford it, and take a water bottle to top up.  There will be a squeeze for seats in the waiting areas, but you can find empty ones, try to get speedy boarding (if available) if you don't want to queue for ages, and expect that some of the times you are there it will be chaos. But the plane will take off, hopefully on time and your bags will be with you. Brace yourself for your return flight, buy passport fast track tickets if you really don't want to queue, although you will still have to wait for your bags (On a good day 20 minutes on a bad day one hour), the toilets may be a bit smelly but improving, and its a pretty quick exit.  Most of the time your car will be in meet and greet on time, or in the parking, and any guests that pick you up will have to pay the privilege and may get stung for £25.You may not like all these things, but they are there and until things improve, you can choose to fly from Liverpool (much easier) or Birmingham (easier) or just accept it, breath and enjoy your holiday.",4
853,"Claustrophobic passageways, poor signage, dirty, and a breakfast fry-up will cost you at least £12, and they put chips with it (yuk). Twice I've used this a/port recently and each time there were enormous queues at passport control because they're too tight to get more machines . Waiting to disembark I saw from the plane window my case being  tossed on a truck again and again and falling as the low life 'handlers aimed for the top of the pile. Don't bother to complain, the management don't care.",1
854,Once again!! As a regular traveller it’s few years since I’ve flown from here as I choose to drive to Heathrow from Sheffield and fly from there as my hatred for this airport became unbearable. It has actually got worst!!! I can only hope I improves after all the work is complete but I retire in 15 Years so not hold my breath. Until then I’d rather sit on the M25 for an hour then endure this place again,1
855,"Sadly this is our local airport - but I'd rather drive  past it to another airport 40 mins away, if flights are available. Chaotic check in, security checks, boarding gates, passport control (they have had standing signs made:  ""one hour from this point""). Everything over-crowded. They could easily employ staff to help pasengers, but choose to maximise profit. Car parking ridiculously expensive, no easy drop off/pick up and they even over-charge you for that. Staff are de-moralised - I pointed out to some that this was one of the worse airports in the world - they said, do you know a worse one then? The truth is, no I don't.",1
856,Absolute chaotic pick up and drop off system - just a money making exercise .  No logical system  extra  30 mins to collect passengers,1
857,I now know from personal experience why Manchester Airport is rated the worst airport in the UK for disabled assistance. I am a semi invalid and requested a wheelchair and attendant in advance on a flight back from Salou last Saturday 13th July. We had to wait on the plane for 30 minutes after all other passengers had disembarked before the wheelchair and attendant turned up.the attendant seemed totally disinterested and after he had taken me up the lift to the beginning of the concourse he disappeared back up the lift without saying a word. My wife who is 73 and like me not in the best of health had to shove me all the way to the baggage reclaim area. You should be ashamed Manchester Airport for your very poor disabled assistance.,1
858,Everything is 2x as expensive compared to other UK airports from the parking to the sweets in the shops.Security was like going into a cattle pen.If you fly from T2 there is only a handful of shops and places to eat so if your flying at a peak time good luck with the long queues everywhere you look.,2
859,"Departed from terminal 2 on 28th June returning on the 5th July on both occasions we used gate A12, what an experience to forget, never again will We use an airline that departs from this terminal we had prebooked wheelchair assistance for my wife, unfortunately I did not book it for myself along with several other passengers that appeared to be struggling with hand luggage and walking such a long distance.",1
860,"I travel through many international airports and I can quite honestly say that Manchester Airport is the very worst that I have to use.  It is also unfortunately my nearest international airport and so have to use it.  By far the worst aspect is passing through security - and it doesn't matter which terminal you use - they are as bad as each other.  I overheard one traveller describing it as a ""kettling"" experience, with rude staff shouting at travellers and treating them like ""criminal cattle"".  Also, it seems that all passengers now have to go through the body scanners rather than the metal detector gates used by virtually all other airports (including Heathrow by the way.)  No idea why, but the last 5 times I have been through these I have been subjected to pat down searches, shoes removed and scanned separately etc. etc.  I am a 60+ plus ""professional"", I am a seasoned traveller, never wear anything metal when I go through but am still stopped and searched.  Ridiculous.  Once through, if your carry on luggage is not rejected and searched, the place is crowded, worn out and just plain unpleasant.  Arriving from Heathrow to terminal 3 today, the baggage reclaim and arrivals areas were dull, dirty and opressive.  I was being met by a private taxi.  There were no directions from the arrivals area to the pick up point - which turned out to be level 2 of the multi story car park and the only reason I found this out was by walking into the middle of the road and asking one of the ""drop off"" marshalls.  The taxi picked me up, had to find somewhere to park and the driver had to walk back to a pay point so that he could pay the exit fee, while I waited in the taxi.  Ridiculous!  I would like to take weekend European city breaks but it takes a couple of days to recover from the trauma of Manchester airport, so quite honestly, I don't bother.  I hope that some of the airlines using the airport read this review so they know that the awful ""Manchester experience"" is putting their customers off!  Unfortunately I have to use the airport at least twice more this year, and I am not looking forward to it.",1
861,"Its not a bad airport! Its terrible.Is it possible to make an airport more cramped, expensive, dirty and nasty that Manchester? NOPE its the worst Airport in UK.",1
862,It’s the only airport where arrivals queue for almost an hour to get through passport control. No other airport is this bad. And the staff that manage the queue are incompetent Will travel from Leeds Bradford on future trips as this happens all too often at terminal three,1
863,"Terminal 2 is rubbish! Tui customers have a long walk to and from their aircraft, British airways and Virgin,Qantas etc customers wouldn't be treated like this. Dont get me started on the system at arrivals it's nothing less than disorganised chaos. Not even worth one star!! I dont blame arrivals staff it's just the rubbish system they have work with. Come on Management get your act together for all your customers and staffs sake.God knows you are wringing enough money out of us. Thoroughly disgusted with you!",1
864,"I'm so glad so many others have identified precisely the same problems with Manchester Airport as I have - I thought it was just me. The security staff are shamefully and unnecessarily discourteous. I've flown from nearly every other UK airport - from some of them countless times: Bham., Gatwick, Glasgow, Heathrow ... There, security staff manage to remain professional and do their jobs carefully, but they say, 'Please' before asking - not ordering, as occurs at Manchester - passengers to go somewhere or do something. There is absolutely no reason  and no excuse for the security staff at Manchester to behave so dreadfully. Like so many others who've left reviews, I now avoid flying from and to Manchester. Even though I live and work in the centre of the city, I now get the train to Bham or London and fly from there - or I go on the train. Why doesn't Look North, or the Manchester Evening News expose the dissatisfaction that so many passengers have expressed?",1
865,"First time visiting Manchester airport, Jet Park and shuttle transfer all good and efficient. Terminal 2 escalator was broken so big queue for the only lift available. No issues at security. Prices for food and drink are extreme. Delayed by an hour and a half as bridge to plane was not working and they “could not get hold of an engineer to come look at it and verify safe to use”. On return the flight was delayed coming to us from Manchester for another “technical issue”. When we arrived, we had no issues at passport control but others were struggling with the machines and the attending staff member was just barking orders at the passengers. Finally, after disembarking at 0012 we had to wait nearly an hour for our luggage, this is what prompted our review, as the Jet2 flight that landed after us all got their luggage before us.I have another visit to Manchester airport in September so I am hopeful it will be a bit better.",2
866,"The special assistance team at Manchester airport are fantastic. I was travelling with a disabled loved-one and the team provided us with assistance including fast-track through security, a guide to take us to our departure gate and priority boarding onto our plane. The help they provided made our experience of the airport a positive one instead of the immense struggle it would have been to travel without their help. Huge thanks to the team.",5
867,"As I avoid Manchester airport because of the ridiculously long queues we now go to Gatwick. This is a 4 hour drive compared to the 45 minutes to Manchester,  but worth it because of the awfulness there.  This year at Gatwick we were dropped off by the taxi at 9.55m( no charges, take note Manchester). We checked our baggage in, went through security and were sat down with a drink of coffee at 10.35. A time that would have not even seen us through baggage cue k in at Manchester. Manchester I have done with you.",1
868,Awful and shockingly bad airport. Immigration was over 2 hours for small children tired after long trip - all funny to shockingly incompetent staff who clearly have no idea in organisational skills. It is a disgrace on the North of England and my advice would be to stay down South when flying like Gatwick or Heathrow. A disgrace.,1
869,"Very bad experience.1, For departure, car parked in multi stored building, level 10. 1a)There is no trolly on that floor.1b)There is no sign to find out the lift.1c) I am not able to find a pedestrian way to use heavy luggage and pushchair.2. Identified the lift with difficulty. There are two departure symbol . Departure A ( level 5) and departure B (level 0). But there is no indication on where I need to go. Without having a trolly, I went there in level 5 and searched, then only I can identity I am into wrong floor.Very poor on giving the right direction. Difficult to find out the right places, lack of direction and resources. Avoid if you have other alternatives.",1
870,"Manchester Airport used to be good... now it’s a nightmare. Ive heard a taxi driver say his drop off charge exceeded the taxi fare he charged (since paid drop off was introduced!).Recently, the time taken for us to get from Jetparks exceeded half an hour and our fast track pass was a waste of money as the people behind us got through way quicker without a fast pass - the queue was shorter! Hope management can consider making changes for an improved customer experience.",1
871,Meet and Greet car parking service. I used this recently and when i received the car back and item ( hiking water bottle £8) had been removed from the front seat. They had the keys and there hadn't been a break in. They denied there staff had taken it but what else could have happened? I believe some of their staff are thieves.,1
872,"Manchester Airport appears to set its goals extremely low and consistently fails to achieve any of them. What a truly awful and disgraceful place it has become. Scruffy, chaotic and overcrowded are the best accolades I can muster to describe this miserable excuse for a so called international transport hub.  I cannot think of a single positive experience during my recent visit.  The security area of the airport is a total mess, with absolutely shockingly rude staff.  To the member of staff who claims not to be rude or abrupt, sorry mate but you are !  The best area of this airport is Manchester Airport train station which allowed me to escape and travel to Edinburgh to catch a hastily rearranged flight the next day.",1
873,"Review is specifically for special assistance, we travel via jet 2 from Manchester 3 or 4 times a year and while we find them excellent in all respects, special assistance at Manchester are becoming worse every journey we take, the last occasion being this week myself and my wife who has ms and has to use a wheelchair waited on the aircraft for 40 minutes for them to arrive and when they did one person with a single wheelchair arrived to assist 4 passengers ! The jet 2 staff were excellent but very frustrated as they are trying to turn the aircraft around, our family in the baggage had become quite alarmed wondering if we were ok due to the extended delay, this is no way to treat disabled people in this day and age and it must improve",1

875,"£16 for a chicken burger, £6 for a pint of larger and you will have to pay £1.06 for a euro. Take sandwiches, abstain from drink until you get to your destination and get your euros on the high street. Manchester Airport is run by thieves that will prey upon your hard earned holiday money, avoid spending anything at the airport and help put these people out of business.",1
876,"Simply the worst airport I have ever been to. I dreaded going back to terminal 3, security has to be the worst in the world. You could remove all belongings from your bag, follow all procedures  and your bag will still go through for checking for a second time. Literally no other airport operates in this way, everyone whp goes through is treatee like a criminal.I just so happened to be passing through on 19th May when they couldnt refuel planes. The terminal was jam packed, large groups of stags and hens drunk having been delayed for hours, armed police breaking up fights. Not a single member of staff to speak to regarding cancellations. It was a dangerous place to be, the few staff that were present had to endure all kinds of abuse from angry customers. But while the lowest paid get the abuse, the bigwigs profiting from the ridiculous parking charges amonst other extras, downright refuse reponsibility and wont pay out to the tens of thousands affected.I ended up flying from Luton, much more pleasant place, through security in 10 minutes without a fastpass. Will be booking flights from further afield in future, ive experienced more  hospitality in the airports of lesser developed countries.",1
877,Arrived in Manchester Airport on May 21st. Utter and complete chaos.Border Control total farce. There must have been at least 3 flights land at the same time in terminal 3. All new signs and directions for arrivals for people from the UK and a lot of other countries whose flags are displayed on the boards All other countries to go a different way. When I approached a very unfriendly member of staff who was busy standing chatting with 3 other staff. I explained to him I have an Irish Passport and as there was NOT an Irish flag displayed inquired if I had to use the other passport line. He insisted very rudely that no I had to use the UK check in line. I believe most people know Ireland is NOT in the UK.  It would be nice if who ever designed the display boards with the flags could add the Irish flag to avoid further confusion. A dreadful experience of at least 30 mins to do Passport check.,1
878,"How does this airport achieve four stars?Terrible parking, chaotic check in, horrendous security with frequent queues and inconsistent checks only to be faced with scruffy restaurants and cafes before you board your flight. There is nothing remotely nice about this airport experience. I dread flying from Manchester.",1
879,"Flew into Manchester  Terminal 1 this morning. A horrible experience. Passenger flow is dreadful. From our arrival gate we had to walk for a long way down corridors that were far too narrow for the number of people coming off our plane. Lots of stairways and tight corners adding to the constriction.  Totally over-crowded.  Only one escalator on our route - and that was out of order. As we approached the passport area we had to go up another flight of steps, made all the more difficult because some genius had decided to located the ""non-EU"" landing card counter at the bottom of the steps, causing an obstruction as passengers stopping to use the counter blocked the flow of passengers trying to go up the stairs. As we got close to passport control area another stream of passengers from other gates merged from our left - again in a corridor that was far too narrow for the number of passengers involved. It was chaotic and stressful. And then the final horror. A very over-crowded passport check  area that was more like a large number of cattle pens than a modern airport. Again an area that was just not big enough for the number of people using it. A totally dreadful experience and it is truly embarrassing to think that this is the first impression foreign visitors are given of the UK when they have the misfortune to arrive at this terminal",1
880,Appalling experience going through security where staff without any explanation proceeded to put their hand down inside my underwear in full public view and not just checking the waistband of jeans. Totally traumatised by the experience which ruined my holiday.,1
881,This changes every time I go through while waiting a man was walking up the line telling everyone to put phones in your bag or coat pockets. The man with the trays slowed the whole thing down by making everyone take them out again .the previous month a lady had everyone routing them out to switch them off.which again slowed the whole thing down againIf cattle or sheep were bring lead through the would probably have to walk through a disinfectant tray.but humans are often asked to remove shoes and walk barefoot or in sweaty socks where thousands of others walk with the possibility of spreading athletes foot or other infections. I now carry two plastic bags to do this,1
882,"This is possibly one of the if not the worst airport I’ve ever traveled through.The majority of the staff we encountered where rude offhand and unhelpful, The security clearance are beyond a joke and empty bags without first asking if they can you are left waiting for ages before you are finally seen to retrieve your belonging, they scan repeatedly the same items which is unnecessary and so stressful.  When you complain to senior staff they ignore you, their procedures seem to change depending on who is in charge, I will never fly from this airport again. It’s awful, especially when you compare it to airports across Europe of similar size.  And bigger.,",1
883,"3 May 2019 - I am truly amazed that this airport gets 4 stars! Fake News possibly???  I have travelled all my working life across the globe, so I am very confident when I say Manchester is not the worst, but for a first world country it is truly shameful.Airport management really need to get on the ground and find out what is actually happening to fare paying passengers. They also need to evaluate the facilities and equipment. Staff are under pressure because of the rubbish they are given to work with and so the downward spiral of shameful behaviour becomes self full-filling.Today, all the moving walkways to T1 were broken. Have been in this condition since January. The escalator to T1a departures was also broken so everyone had to use the lift to go down 1 floor. We were not allowed to use the stairs because staff were using them! Good to see priorities are not confused at Manchester, pesky customers!! Security, well, what can I say that hasn’t already been said? Beggars belief, you have to experience to believe it, I’m here every week! But make sure you are not uptight beforehand or it won’t go well for you!! Andy Burnham and you other people who claim to represent this great city. If you are still in office, maybe you should consider how you can help sort this debacle out and make Manchester a place we want to fly into! Personally I think Exeter is the best option and take the train!! Yes, that’s how bad your airport actually is - ARE YOU LISTENING?",1
884,"This airport is still on it downward path. It is common to wait hours in baggage reclaim I have even had to queue to get out of baggage reclaim then wait an hour for a bus to the car rental village. This location used to have an excellent car hire pick up system now it is horrendous. As I am forced to pass through the duty free shops I refuse to purchase from them. Now you are in effect forced to pay to arrive at the airport. Just to add insult after following the direction to the drop off point three hours before my flight only to find the entrance blocked forcing me to go through the car park and costing me four pounds then eventually managed to find a drop off costing another three pounds. It would appear that traffic management, the coach driver or the car hire staff had not been notified of schedule changes. Truly awful",1
885,Terminal 1 Arrivals - ShockingReturned from Boston via Dublin and both flights were fantastic.  Arrived into Manchester after a 35 minute flight from Dublin only to be stood by the baggage carousel for well over an hour waiting for our bags to come off.  There were not that many people on the Dublin to Manchester flight that had checked bags so why did it take SO long for them to come through.  They even had the audacity to add another flight onto our carousel before ours were finished when there were other empty carousels that could have been used.I know it was early on a Sunday morning but why are the baggage handlers allowed to leave passengers waiting so long for their bags?,1
886,Manchester Airport is a DUMP! I have never been in such a cramped airport all my life! The ceilings are low and the space is dark. It Gets EXTREMELY Busy. Doesn’t come close to How nice Dublin Airport is! I would have imagined it to be much nicer but that wasn’t the case!,1
887,"Every time I fly via Manchester Airport my luggage gets pulled out at security, and every time for something different which is not actually a violation to carry. I paid a bit extra for Fast Track this last time because I know it takes so long, and it still ended up taking over an hour. It seemed that the 'good' luggage was about 1 in 10 of 'bad' luggage - with even people who were not getting pulled over still having to wait ages because of the backlog through the scanner. I fly quite often and NEVER have this problem at any other airport both at home and abroad. I pack very carefully but it seems no matter how careful I am, I can't win at this airport. I very very carefully made sure that no fluids were left out of my 'fluid bag', and I followed all other guidelines. But I got pulled over for tablets in a small glass bottle, an asthma inhaler (which last time I got told wasn't a fluid and I didn't want to take up valuable room in my little fluid bag), oh and a small mirror with a light. I got speaking with the guy who was checking my bags and said that I only ever had these issues in Manchester. I was glad they were been vigilant but vigilance had to be tempered with a good dose of pragmatism as basically they were checking 8 out of 10 people going thru. He was actually a pleasant young man and he sort of agreed with me. He said he used to work at a different airport and that he knew it was a lot different in Manchester. I actually felt sorry for him and his colleagues, they have an awfully difficult job to do, people shouting at them and getting agitated at missing planes, plus their work space is ridiculously cramped yet there are acres of space given over to retail once you finally get through the hallowed doors of security. If security is so important (which we all know it is) - give them the space, the environment and the tools to do it quickly and efficiently so that everyone has a much better experience.",2
888,"This would have been a half decent review had I not had such an unprofessional and downright rude member of staff in Non EU passport control (arrivals T2) speak to me and my boyfriend as if we were less than human. This was on Sunday 22nd April upon a return flight from Barcelona at around 14:15. My boyfriend had to use the Non EU section and was not allowed to pass through straight away and was subjected to questions about his stay. The lady working in passport control (we did not get her name) had an offensively impolite tone and her whole demeanour was unfriendly and unapproachable. Her attitude and the way she spoke towards us was completely unjustified and once I got into the car I actually cried. I WILL NEVER USE THIS AIRPORT AGAIN.Additionally, when I went to use the toilet I had to walk into four different cubicles before finding one that didn't have excrement in it. This airport is supposed to providing a service to each and every one of it's passengers. They should look into their staff and ensure that each human being leaving the airport is treated fairly and with respect . It's a shame that one individual can cause such tarnish on a person's experience because the other staff members we encountered were pleasant and represented Manchester airport well.",1
889,"Manchester Airport is one of the worst airports I had to use and I travel a lot. Staff are most certainly inconsiderate and in many cases rude, security check is terrible, I’ve never had some of my items I fly with regularly scanned so many times. My DSLR camera was placed in the basket for re-scan (despite not being told to pull it out of the protective bag before first scan) and it rolled down the basket as it was coming down the line! They security staff is rude and exert their power and are most unfriendly people I have ever had to deal with when travelling through the airports. The queues are long, it’s hard to find your way around, there are people wondering around everywhere not knowing where to go and no one is helping them to find their way. Even at security fast track I was moved down 5 lanes before they finally allowed me to start getting through, even thought I told them I had little time, they made nothing of it. The terminals are packed, there is no way to run through it to catch your flight as there are people everywhere and not enough room to walk between chairs. On the way back at least the stuff was fine, but the pick up car park token charged us three times and still didn’t let us through, until we called an operator who was for once helpful and let us out (rightly so if we had to pay £14.00 for 3 minute pick up stay!). If you really have to travel form there, I recommend to be at least 3-4 hours early, as there is a lot you’ll have to go through before you catch your flight, and most of it won’t be pleasant. I will be avoiding flying from there as much as I can.",1

Get it right and people will stop complaining!!!!,2
891,"Just arrived back from Naples.Terminal 2 is a badly designed disgrace. My wife, who has a bad back, had to walk about 8oo metres, I would estimate, to the baggage reclaim then a further 400 metres to be picked up by our taxi. She has a heart pacemaker and the last couple of times we have travelled through the airport the security staff have been totally heartless and rude, almost reducing her to tears-  they humiliated her and treated her as if she was a piece of meat. They seem to take a delight in being rude and officious. We all understand they have an important function but their attitude stinks! I worked at Heathrow for 5 years so understand airports and have been through many airports but Manchester is the worst.",1
892,"The new pick up facility at Manchester 2 terminal is a disgrace. I recently picked up a disabled relative and was astounded by how far the parking is from the arrivals hall, especially as passengers are outside most of the time regardless of their abilities. I was also told the distance from getting off the airplane to getting to the arrivals hall was 1 mile long without any faciliities. Can't believe the result of a new terminal means this kind of service in 2019, you would potentially expect this from an old out of date infrastructure.  There should be extra assistance for those people in wheelchairs and there should be inside access to all airport terminals.",1
893,"Love this Airport! Brilliant services all round, including the trollers! Keep up the brilliant work! Will continue to use & highly recommend! Thank you",5
894,"The Airport charges for trolleys on departure and arrival and now on drop off and collection of relatives, just seems so unfare to travellers and their families. espiecailly when local residents want to support the local airport. Not the best in travel experience.Feel so sad for new visitors from overseas trying to get change to get a trolly , gives the impression that Manchester is so poor that they need to charge for a trolley that in so many countries is provided for free im lost for words !!",1
895,Good airport but disgusted they are now charging from drop off,4
896,"Again, the Passport Control at Manchester Airport is the worst in Europe.Untrained staff, insufficient lector machines, endless queues. A disaster. Travel to Berlin, Düsseldorf, Zürich or Alicante for example and you are through in minutes. They even don't have staff to manage the queue as they aren't any. Quick operating systems and plenty of them is the solution. Manchester's Passport Control is a pure time waste and not acceptable.A very poor performance, again.",1
897,"Manchester airport check-in was chaotic at 6.am 28th February 2019, the Tui computer systems were down so even though we had printed the boarding passes out we had to wait until the Gran Canaria flight had been processed before we could get into the check-in desks that were showing on the departure board for Sol, Cape Verde. We then queued to a be processed until a stroppy Tui rep told us that we were in the wrong queue and that we should have looked at the departure board, we had and when we moved to the correct one it was still showing the queue that we had been in! Then the take off was delayed by 45 minutes when we had sit behind 4 other planes waiting to take off.Coming back a week later at 2245 we had to stack over Liverpool for at least 20 minutes because of runway maintenance.We will never use Manchester again!",2
898,"Just returned from a week's holiday to find my parents' car had been burgled in the multi-storey car park whilst we were away. They took overnight bags and money (not visible). When a member of staff was informed, we were asked if the car had been locked and on answering it was, they asked us how the thief could have got in. Very rude and frankly not our question to answer as we were victims of a crime in their car park, which a quick search on the internet also reveals to be a common occurrence. No CCTV either. Will not be returning.",1

900,Do not use Peter Ashley Car Parking for Manchester Airport. They damaged my car and agreed Ito pay for the damage this was in November 2018 . Advised to send two estimates which I did now refusing to pay. I am now starting court action.Once again Do not use this company,1
901,"Security.Travelling on a Wed in February is not the airport's busiest time of year. So you would expect your experience through security to be reasonable. How wrong can you be?Firstly its based in the airport bowels with low ceilings suggesting it isn't one of the airport priorities. Then you're faced with a Disneyland type snaking queue of over 100 people progressing slowly through security. It was smelly, chaotic and a very poor experience. Are we a third world country?Just the basics were wrong. What do you put in the trays, what not? Where do the trays go after failing security, and more importantly where do the people go. They wait in a disorderly fashion in an area that blocks the passage of all other passengers passing meaning passengers have to push their way past.I know this is necessary for air travel and never desirable. But how can other airports get it so much better. Management - you need a complete re-think on this and look at other airports.All other things being equal, we choose other airports because of the bad experience through security at Manchester.",1
902,"From experience DO Not use Jet park3 there are no marked parking bays.I arrived back from the canary island,s 24 /2/19To find my car had been badly damaged no note left by the perpetrator body shop estimate £400.I contacted the relevant parking company to be told you park at your own risk I new this and they could not supply CCTV footage and take it up with the police as criminal damage some chance.If you were the perpetrator then the damage to your vehicle must be extensive as well .And must be feeling guilty or if your eye sight is that bad consider if you should be driving!!",1
903,"Review of recent trip to Dubai. First interaction there was an issue, went to drop off area and the bus took 35 minutes to arrive. I had time to spare but a couple waiting with me  didn’t and they were stressed. More frequent buses please (or is it a ploy to make us pay the £3/4?)Check in and security quick, fit for purpose. Not a great waiting area, not particularly comfortable, adequate. On return trip we had to walk a long way from arrival gate, there was a queue at passport control but it was handled very well, was moving quickly and I got through in good time. Brilliant. Luggage was quick to get off the plane and my bag was soon off, easy journey through security and out.",4
904,"Terrible experience after paying £5.00 pp for fasttrack on arrival, we then stood around for 90min waiting for our bags and further 30min for shuttle bus to jet park 2, all caused by a bus stop placement that resulted in a stampede like rush to get aboard due to a demand that outstrips the service, after enduring a long haul overnight flight the thought of returning to Manchester Airport used to be just a bit disappointing but has now become frustrating and annoying enough to spoil anyone's holiday and seems to be getting even worse .....",1
905,"Had an absolutely awful experience at Manchester security today.  The staff are rude, arrogant and extremley unhelpful. They close of queues with the straps making you walk the long way round to same queue for no reason. The staff stood at the 2nd belt whilst the queue got longer at 1st belt to just tell us it was closed. When doing a bag search the staff finished a full length conversation while you stand waiting on your luggage to be scanned. They have no manners, obviously customer service is not a priority.. Will avoid at all costs . Would strongly recommend you travel from Liverpool airport and avoid Manchester airport!!!",1
906,"A horrendous airport to fly from. I have not had the trouble with parking as others have, although I struggled to find my car parked by meet & greet on the 13th floor. but just unbelievable queues with no information in all security areas taking hours and hours to get through!  I was apprehended at x ray one time due to a carrot in my jacket pocket to munch on. No information is given to customers, no attempt to speed up processes is made, and staff are not friendly at all. My last vist there in January took almost three hours of queuing and being fastracked to get through passport control.  Liverpool, Cardiff, Bristol are a much better experience.",1
907,"I was warned! Just tried to drop my son off at departures. Having studies the site map with a plan to go to the free drop off and shuttle bus but hey no signs! So I went for the paid drop off at terminal one. A few yellow lines in the road, a multi story car park or an exit barrier???? If you want traffic to flow it needs to be better than this. I won’t be doing it again - oh, is that the point?",1
908,Left car for 7 days in  December 2017 and came back car has been broken in. Everything was out from glove compartment and from the boot. Nothing is been stolen but still left sour taste.  Funny thing is Could not reach Airport security standing there only emergency services reported to the police. Hope they will fix this problem.,1
909,"This should be zero stars. Manchester airport has got to be the worse international airport in Western Europe.The security staff have got to be the most ignorant, rude and bombastic group of individuals working in any airport in the Western Hemisphere.The baggage handling staff are definitely the laziest group of workers in Greater  Manchester. The management are obviously not bothered in the slightest about its customers.",1

My husband ( at 80yrs)   has an artificial Leg and can't remove the shoe on that foot was told to remove his trousers, this is in the middle of the security baggage area, after a heated refusal the very surly chap let him through, The boxes of peoples belonging were piling up on top of one another, the staff are surly sullen and its obvious they think that dealing with travelers is beneath them. The security area is to small for purpose I'd get rid of Duty? Free as its not worth all that space it takes up.",1

912,"In the last month I have travelled through 12 airports including Heathrow, Atlanta, JFK, Chicago and LA. I can honestly say that security staff at Manchester airport have the worst attitude out of all of them. In fact I'd go as far as saying the others would get 4-5 stars considering what they have to deal with daily and how hard their job must be, they were polite and pleasant in their work.  On all 5 visits to Manchester in the last 6 months, I have experienced nothing but jobs worths - rude, inconsiderate, it's like they they make it their business to treat you like something on the bottom of their shoe. I am a Mancunian through and through and this is not the Manchester way. I am a seasoned travelled and have actually worked at Manchester airport so I am fully aware of security risks and the importance of what they do, but there is no need to be so foul with everyone. At Heathrow, Atlanta and Chicago, the busiest airports in the world - and New York, that probably has the most security threats, if their staff can show respect and a smile, then there is absolutely no excuse. Shame on you Manchester Airport. It's worth noting, Washington Dulles is the worst for long immigration and dirty disgusting airport, but even their security staff were nice.",1
913,"Ridiculous charges for drop off and pick up. You basically have no choice but to pay and the minimum charge is RIDICULOUS!! £4minimum. Don't you lot make enough money from everything else we have to pay for such as food, flights and trollies etc etc??",1

I'm assuming that they are affiliated to Manchester airport although there is nothing on the web site to say either way. Suffice to say there service was appalling. They didn't have the correct booking when we arrived. Their fee didn't include the £4 charge for exiting the car-park and we had to wait 50 minutes for our car at 1am because they didn't know what day or the time  we were landing even though I had phoned up 12 hrs prior to our arrival to let them know! Manchester airport charges are a scandalous money extortion racket. I shall be avoiding this airport, as others are, in the future.",1
915,"I'm giving Manchester airport and Ethiopian airlines a shocking review for their absolute lack of communication with their clients. Having meant to be in the air an hour ago, we have only been notified that our flight is delayed due to crew rest.

So many clients have missed their connections, too.",1
916,"When I first started to use Manchester airport some 30 years ago it was brilliant. As it got bigger and busier standards inevitably declined and it became more like other airports we love to hate, but something seems to have gone seriously wrong in the last 6 months or so. Looking at the reviews on this system for the period since last July, virtually all ratings have been ""bad"" or ""poor"" - you have to go back to June to find a single 5* one. Charges to drop passengers off, poor signposting, long queues for check-in / bag drop, even longer ones for security (with notices threatening ""at least 30 mins delay"" if your bag doesn't get through the X-ray machine - as if passengers need to be punished for failing to obey orders), over-priced poor-quality food in the restaurants, demands to scan your boarding pass if you want to buy a newspaper, long delays at baggage reclaim, non-refundable charges for baggage trolleys (no wonder they're left abandoned and scattered all round the bus-stop area). Someone senior in the airport's management needs to have a look at what's going on and DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. Otherwise I think I'll go down to London next time I want to fly anywhere - it can't be any worse.",2
917,Just checked into terminal 2 at 7:45 on 29th December. The security guy in the stand up x ray machine was a disgrace. Appalling attitude. Rude. Nasty.

918,"This airport is against people with disability's unless you are fit they don't care you are second rate person. I hope who ever is in charge of this airport suffers a  disability of his or her self then they might realise we still want to enjoy life as they do. They really stressed me and the other 3 passengers. Also while sat on aircraft the pilot said he had personally radioed in stating the time he was due to land. When I arrived at t1 I was greeted by helpful jet 2 lady who asked me did I need assistance so it was arranged for me to have wheel chair waiting at gate 15 as there would be stairs which i struggle with, but i was not  made aware that it would take me over 40 minutes to walk there. when I got there I found no chair so had to go down on lift then walk about 1/4 of mile under wings of another plane in very strong winds which affected my angina making me breathless then lifted up on a truck then entered plane.that  was the start of my holidayThis airport is a total shambles it needs someone who knows what a disability is.I have just got back from fueterventura 27/12/2018.was sat on plane nearly 40 mins waiting for assistasnce which still had not arrived, they said they could not find any wheel chairs for four of us to disembark.in the end I had to walk from aircraft with another person and very helpful hostess Rachel of jet 2 flight as my taxi was waiting to pick me up outside the airport as private taxies are not allowed to park in arrivals I had to pay over twenty pounds as he waited for me extra.

919,"My husband needed Special wheelchair assistance at the airport, which we had requested when we booked our holiday. We waited and waited for someone to push his wheelchair through to the boarding gate. There was no one available for nearly an hour and a half to take him through, by which time we were beginning to panic. Other people were also very anxious, especially one couple who literally had half an hour before boarding the plane.  This so called ""Special Assistance"" needs to be radically reviewed, as it leaves already vulnerable people distressed and feeling like second class citizens. I would add, that this is not the first time this has happened, so its not a ""one -off "" scenario. Its a complete disgrace",1

The place is chaotic, perhaps staff are under pressure but I will not be using M/C again if Liverpool is an alternative. Wake up Manchester. I’m a proud Manc. so don‘t say this lightly.

Charges for drop-off,  no proper collection point - chargeable car parking instead,  charges for baggage trolleys,  deliberate queues at security clearly designed to trigger demand for fast track tickets (most of the security lines closed to keep queues high),  and the same at passport control coming back.  This used to be a great airport - now its complete garbage - they should take the licence off the operators.  This is suppose to be a public transport hub - not a private profiteering centre.",1
935,I agree with all the reviews that say this airport is a national embarrassment!,1
936,"Used both in the last couple of monthsTerminal 3Small , dirty with inadequate facilities . Why is everyone who works in it so rude ?.!. On returnTo uk on 19 th September over 300 people waiting to get through passportControl😮😮😮outrageous security is unbelievably cramped and slow , staff are rude and ignorant . Whatever must foreign visitors think? 😮😮 especially when they see signs (cheapCardboard )  saying welcome toGREAT Britain, nothing great about this place !Terminal 1They must put the ‘reject ‘ staff to work in terminal 3, because the staff are wonderfull in terminal 1, considering what they have to put up with .Absolutely filthy everywhere , dirty smelly toilets , with human waste of all types on the floor in the gents 😮Missing ceiling panels , dirty corridors , up and down stairs and in lifts all the time , cramped , and awful food at extortionate prices ( take your own !!). Terrible  signage whichIs totally  confusing . We had to check into Air Transat , in a gloomy room in the cellar !, for an international flight to Toronto !!!Instead of just ‘taking too much money from customers ‘ and giving them little in return ‘ it’s time the companies that own this airport, visited places like Toronto Airport  and Alicante and Malaga Airports in Spain , to see how to design , build and run a modern day airport.Air travel is stressful enough , going through this airport makes this ten times worse",1
937,"So I returned from Spain recently and made use of the T2 Meet and Greet service the airport offers. The initial experience seemed great, you drive in, the car is ""scanned"" (they take a few photos of each side) and then you drop the car with them, all seemed great, right up until I came to collect the car a few weeks later.The experience of getting the car back started great and was very easy, but when I got in and turned on the engine, I got a tyre pressure warning. I didn't think much of this at the time, the car had been sat for about 12 days so I just got out my air compressor and pumped it up. I didn't bother anyone about this (why would I? It's a simple thing to sort) and just drove out of the car park. Unfortunately, within a few seconds, I got another warning light and a completely flat tyre.Now I don't know about you, but 1+1 normally = 2 in my world and having left a perfectly fine car with the airport and having it returned with a flat, I feel like damaged occurred while it was in the care of Manchester Airport. They disagree...I complained and was first told the car had come in with a low tyre, they tried showing me the pictures (from the ""Scan"" when I arrived) but these just showed my car with four perfectly good tyres, none of them was low as I had just driven 70 miles on the tyres and would have noticed any problems. When this backfired they told me that because I had left the car park (I was 2 seconds up the road) they could no longer help and it was my problem.They did call a company out to come and replace the tyre but this was at my expense.I'm honestly appaled by how this has gone, it's very obvious that the damage occurred when my car was in their care, but they just hide behind their terms and conditions and won't even attempt to help, then have the gall to say they hope to see me again in the future.The airport itself seemed ok, the waits were acceptable and the baggage arrived quickly enough as to not cause me much concern. The meet and greet service is just a huge letdown and caused me undue stress and cost. I would suggest everyone avoids the meet and greet service.",1
938,"It isn't Barcelona.I've flown between Manchester and Barcelona 3 times in the last 7 weeks (and again tomorrow). The contrast between the two airports in terms of ease of transit couldn't be more obvious. In Barcelona, from landing to leaving the airport I don't think we've spent more than 30 minutes in total. Even using the train it's possible to be in the city in under an hour. Unfortunately immigration/passport control at Manchester has been atrocious. Last Tuesday we arrived from a late flight and joined the back of a chaotic queue with staff struggling to cope and little awareness by the passengers of what was going on. Some people were blatantly queue-jumping and others with small children were not being told that they could use a fast-track line. It took well over an hour to get to the e-passport gates where 2 of the 5 were out of service. This Monday we arrived earlier, but unfortunately our flight had been delayed by about an hour. We weren't told the reason for this but it arrived late in BCN. Yet again we joined the back of a long queue. Behaviour was a bit better then but a non-British family with two small children in front of us did not hear the staff member muttering that people travelling with under-12s could go forward so we had to tell them and they were a bit conscious that they were suddenly having to push past everyone. Again it took about an hour to get to the front and then delayed trains at the airport station meant that we missed the last train home by about two minutes. We managed to find a train going in our general direction then spent £50 on a taxi to get home.I appreciate that staffing levels at the UK Border are not entirely the airport's fault but I'm definitely not looking forward to repeating the experience next Tuesday.If I remember, I'll time the transits through the two airports and update this review.I did remember! Although I'm not sure how useful it was. Our flight from Barcelona was over two hours late meaning that we landed at 01:00. We sat in row 4 on the plane so we're amongst the first passengers off and walked quickly to border control. There was nobody there because the previous flight had cleared ages before and all 5 eGates were working.Timings from touchdown to passing through the customs channelBarcelona (at c10:00) 15 minutes 24 seconds.Manchester (at 01:00) 21 minutes 36 seconds.Much the best experience of the last three trips. I wonder if it can be sustained.",2
939,"Manchester Airport is definitely among the worst airports I have ever experienced in my entire life. Even with Fast Track it took security staff over 40 minutes to have my luggage scanned. Staff are rude, inefficient and apparently simply don't like their job. A very grumpy employee had difficulties reading the results of a swab causing another delay as other bags simply were not scanned nor checked any more. I have no words to describe my stressful experience and am shocked to see the quality of a major British international airport. It is only for the lounge 1903 visit that I will award a 5 out of 10",1
940,Ridiculous charges went to pick up my daughter and bf they had closed terminal 3 had to go on multi story car park obv paying more as they had to walk to us £4 10 mins disgusting. People parked up as can’t really go and park ad to expensive police were moving all cars on parked at roadside. It’s like a bloody circus will look at Liverpool airport when I book .,1
941,"I have used the airport four times this year.- twice each T1 and T3.T1: both times the queue for security check was out almost to the doors at level 5 drop off, then you have to find your way through the huge maze that is the ""tax free"" shopping area to hopefully find a seat until your gate number is posted.T3: Passengers with luggage must not use the escalator, but must queue for the lift. What sort of design is this for a free flowing experience?My third and fourth trips were after the new drop off charges were introduced - the taxi fare has now jumped a fiver to cover this latest tax on the long suffering traveller, and where is the option for free pick ups, to go with the remote free drop off, may I ask?Immigration on the return is consistently a joke, with the automated machines rejecting many weary travellers passports, requiring assistance from the attendants. And don't get me started on the £1 for a baggage trolley scheme. Only Stansted has worse than the overall experience of my local airport this year, and that place is on a par with animals in an abbattoir. Manchester Airport - we pick you up by the ankles and shake you until hopefully your pockets are empty!",2
942,"Disgusting place - rude, ignorant and arrogant staff, particularly through security and passport control. No eye contact, no communication, complete lack of basic manners or response to questions/requests for assistance. Bars and restaurants in terminal one dirty and overcrowded as well as always overpriced. Has always been poor in service and efficiency, but it seems to have reached new lows. Staff pushing past and bumping into you without apology. All staff and management need to spend some time in some of the much friendlier, cleaner and efficient European airports.",1
943,"Worse airport ever flown from. Just gone down hill. Total chaos, over priced drop off charge. Take a look at Gatwick and learn. Must be crap management.",1
944,"I have now used the new drop and pick up point at Manchester airport twice, and it is an absolute joke. And for them to try and say it is to cut down on congestion and nothing to do with money is beyond belief.The whole system is total chaos Que to get in, Que to find a space then to pay, machines always breaking down then Que to get out. Plenty of staff but no use to anyone. I will be doing my best to not use this airport in the future even if it cost me more, it's just not worth the stress over poor experience.",1
945,"As a frequent flyer from Manchester I have seen it go from a good experience into something totally shambolic. Horrendous queues at every part of the journey. Queuing out of the door to even get into departures - so bad it made front page news of the Manchester Evening Telegraph. Fast Track security took 45 minutes. Rude, unhelpful staff at every point. I hate having to use it. Now charging to drop off and pick up. It is now impossible to be picked up by a taxi (they refuse to go) or friends as they face ridiculous charges. The free drop off bus cannot be used to pick up. Why? It goes to a huge empty car park. Customs is a joke and bags take forever. It is the biggest embarrassment in the north. The executive committee should do the honourable thing and resign - Andrew Cowan should rethink his career.",1
946,"Absolute disgrace to have to endure the monster this airport has created to charge for dropping off and picking up, as a traveller requiring disabled assistance through inability to walk distances passengers are left at the building entrance where you then have to find without adequate signage the area where you are allowed to be picked up which is inside a lower deck car park having to cross where the drop off area is outside which works ok for drop off being near the building doors even though it charges £3 to be released from the area ! The big problem when having found the pickup area is the chaos they have created in the fact that everyone is oblivious to the system, where I witnessed others scrambling to meet their collectors even to the point of a adult and child being hit with the entrance barriers  trying to get in the cars there as the is inadequate area's to stop, also whoever is collecting you has a ticket which has to be paid for at a machine away from the exit barriers again nowhere for them to park to be able to pay along with no signage instruction that you cannot pay at the exit  barrier, which should be displayed at the entry barrier, one day there will be accidents to pedestrians and the airport and council of Manchester will only have themselves to blame for having to pay compensations for their shortsighted penny pinching idea's !!  From now on I will not use Manchester and will travel a little further to Liverpool where at least they have some common sense in running facilities for drop off and pickup even though they too charge but a lot cheaper and far better organised ! Goodbye Ringway",2
947,"Terrible service at this disorganised airport from start to finish. Paid £79.99 for parking, to come back to a filthy car (the new terminal was being built by the car park) and they 'forgot' to return the car for meet and greet. So all meet and no 'greet'. Customer support have been appalling in solving the issue for me and gave a me a discount code for future that didn't work. A week since the email and still no response.",1
948,"The new drop off/pick up arrangements at Manchester are a nightmare. If I can avoid using Manchester in the future I will. There seems little consideration for customers. It used to be a great airport, now it is more like a cattle market.",2
949,Dropping my daughter off at terminal 2 with her husband and 2 young children who do not have road sense it was a bit weird parking the car in the middle of 2 lanes of cars .One lane was incoming traffic and the other lane was traffic leaving the drop off point.It has been badly thought out as i can see a accident happening due to parking between the 2 traffic lanes. Another point is the parking fee i was ok going through the exit but if you have the third busiest airport in the uk surely there should be more exit barriers. This airport use to be one of the top airports but since the new manager took charge it has gone downhill and very greedy with charges for things that should be free.,1
950,"Dreadful new drop off arrangements. I took my son, his wife and two small children to catch an early flight from Terminal 1. The 10 minute drop off Is insufficient time to help them get to the check in desk with their cases and buggies etc. So had to go to the multi story, which is not child friendly, steps everywhere, poor or non existent signage. Confusing signs to Term 1b which turns into Term 1a with yet another corridor to get to Term 1b and the Jet 2 checkin desk. Altogether a very stressful experience.",2
951,"Appalling wait for bags.Sadly, this airport just gets worse and worse.",1
952,"This airport is a disgrace. I use it fortnightly to fly on business  and nothing changes. Toilets have broken locks on doors, no soap, dryers not working, no toilet roll and rarely clean. Moving walkway next to gates 23-25 hasn’t worked for at least 18 months. Security is like a cattle market. It’s the worst airport in the UK. If I had a choice I would fly from somewhere else but unfortunately that means a long journey to get the connections I need.",1
953,Chaos after an easy book in with Logan air.Luckily we had fast track through security.Departure area was claustrophobic with low ceilings and felt very enclosed.Thank goodness I normally fly from Birmingham.,2
954,"extremely inconvenient for families travelling with kids,as it is the only airport in the world where your pushchairs are not delivered to the aircraft,rather you have to crawl up and down stairs (with no lifts) holding your hand luggage and kid(s) in your hands",1
955,"Flew out of this airport on Saturday 25th August . I will NEVER use this airport again!  Jet 2 check in team were great but OMG what an appalling experience through security . I couldnt believe you could have so many chicanes of people in such small space . It was 530 am in the morning and it was heaving with people and we were constantly barraged with shouts form the staff to ‘keep moving ‘ ‘read the signs ‘ and so on for the entire 45 mins it took to reach the actual security station . Then we were barraged by constant  shouting from staff for people to stand on the ‘ foot prints ‘ ( for each securty position  )  We were treated like cattle and I honestly though someone might bring out a cattle prod !  I was selected for a body scan by just being pointed at and then shouted at when I didn’t understand what was required .  The departure lounge wasn’t much better nowhere to sit queues everywhere for food or drink . We flew back into the airport on Tuesday 28 th August and was met by similar through passport control in arrivals . At least 20 chicanes of people to get to the ‘ e passport control ‘ what a JOKE !,  25 mins to get there only to see 50% people have to give up with scanning their passport and get checked by an actual human being ! Was this  system supposed to be quicker and more efficient ??? . It would have been quicker to be a non EU passport holder !!! God help them next year when we aren’t in the EU !  And yes when me and my husband got to the scanner both our passports wouldn’t scan so we were greeted by the dulcet tones of the security guard would numbers  8 and 9  ( me and my husband ) please move to be checked by an officer !  . AVOID this airport at all costs !!!",1
956,"Accountability is not something that seems to be part of the MCR vision.The recent changes to drop off charges are the most insane thing I have ever seen. I travel on Business through MCR over 40 times a year, although other airports in the EU also have this charge, it is typically 2Euro for 30 Minutes.The Airport is a service, the current leadership team clearly have no idea of the impact this has on both people and their associated business.Serve your customers and they will in turn serve you, neglect them and public opinion at your peril.",1
957,"Two recent trips through T3. First one breezed through security but flight delayed over 3 hours. Nowhere to sit, people sitting on floor and steps. All food outlets full- staff rude and disinterested.Second visit 25 minutes to get through security, staff rude again.Several hundred people trapped in narrow corridor as blocked by disembarking BA shuttle flight.A very unpleasant place to travel from with staff even more fed up than the passengers.The place needs to be bulldozed.",1
958,This trust pilot rating is suspicious considering all of the terrible reviews. The worst airport in the Western world. No access to drinking water other than bottled. Not enough passport control staff so queues are horrendous. Airport drop off charges (ridiculous). Staff watches families in the regular queue get to the front and then makes them queue again in the family queue. Poor or no signage when lanes are closed off. Luggage was stuck on belt with no staff to clear it so I watched as non-staff smashed my luggage trying to get the belt uncrowded. The last time I went the airport was evacuated and after a delay we all got on the plane which took off without a single piece of luggage on it. This meant it was not covered by insurance and I attended a rural festival with only the clothes on my back.,1
959,"Very inefficient. Security procedure very poor, staff busy having private conversations instead of focusing on job...35 mins wait for fast food..on return furthest gate away..lots of flights of stairs at 1am when everyone tired as no escalators working so  families & elderly struggling as no staff whatsoever were around..not even border staff when we finally arrived at passport control they ran panicking from a side room. Official carpark transfer drivers too busy having cigarette & gossip with other star coach driver to pick us up. Manchester need to make big improvements!",2
960,"3 quid to drop someone off should be ashamed,  it just another stealth tax ,",1
961,"New drop-off parking charges are slimy, money grabbing and shameful. We are really scraping the barrel in this country now aren't we? Every day in the U.K. is an obstacle course of fines, charges and threats. I realise companies need to turn a profit, but why does everything have to be so complicated and threatening? Manchester airport, just bung an extra fiver on the ticket price and get rid of all the depressing, barriers, rules, hi-vis trolls and ugly warning signs please. Can simplicity and common sense awaken in this petty, punitive, miserable country?",1
962,"Arrived sand checked in, then sent past a security check point, downstairs along a boarded off corridor, up again to another custom point, where xirection of customers was dreadful, some queues had 2 or 3 others had 10 or more. Got to the main place to eat breakfast, cold food slow service and so few staff it was ridiculous. Got to the easy jet gate down stairs and there were no toilets except the disabled, others locked for staff use only, all 2 of them.Return was even worse, waited almost an hour for our bags, a few came through them nothing for 45 mins. No escalators working, lack of toilet rolls in the ladies and not very clean. No working walkways to the sratiom, which isn’t signposted until you ha e actually left the station. Went to ask at information and there was only one member of staff available to deal with everyone.Needless to say  not the only person who won’t be flying again from Manchester, what with car parking charges it’s the pits!!!!",2
963,"The worst international airport I have ever experienced. I arrived from Australia with 2 young children alone and couldn't get a luggage trolley as they only take 1€ or £1. Then, recent changes to parking and drop off meant we couldn't get a taxi. We finally managed to get an uber and it took over 15minutes to get out the car park! I'm not sure whoever implemented  the recent drop off changes has ever had to get picked up from the airport.",1
964,"When we arrived from air canada rouge and landed here in Manchester airport, we found our luggages to have been turned and broken. One of our front pockets were ripped open and the other had the luggage lock broken off and 2 zipper tugs are broken off too. When we looked through our items, we were missing 2 ice wines. Such workers should not be aloud to work and perform such crime of vandalising to our personal items and shouldn't be working there.",1
965,"I have traveled to and from Manchester airport 2-3 times a year over the last 18 years.  Over this time every aspect of the Manchester Airport ""experience"" has deteriorated.  More so over the last 2 years.  1) Arriving at the AirportWith the new pick up/drop off charges in place it has made it more difficult to get to the airport cheaply.  I tried the free bus service which is situated by the staff car park.  Staff and customer buses are identical, so it was frustrating to see a bus and the realize you cannot use it as it was just for staff, even though it was empty.2) Check inEach airline has its own way of checking in (online, check in terminals, desk service), so it can be confusing for travelers who do not travel often.  3) Security ControlThis is a dehumanizing experience for everyone.  Security officers shouting all the time to move along.  Last week I had and aggressive pat down with a security officer (wearing no gloves) who touched my genitalia over my shorts.  You also need to wait ages if your hand luggage needs to be checked. 4) Waiting LoungeI was travelling from T3 and there are not enough seats for everyone to sit.5) Take Offover the last 2 years I have been always been delayed.",1

968,"Manchester airport has to be the worst airport in the u.k.. the pick up atT3  (if you can find it) is a 100% ripoff £4 for a few seconds, no you are wrong. you charge people £1 or £2 for a luggage trolly (none refundable). staff at security rude and bad mannerd  you are only interested in ripping travellers off get as much money per traveller as possible and don't really give a toss. I am using mancherster airport in October as I have already booked this holiday, and if possible in the future I will never ever use this disgrace of an airport again. p.s. I hope someone at the airport reads these reviews as they are not written out of malice just frustration and stress so thanks for that.",1

970,"Manchester Airport T3 is a disgrace and nothing short of a rip off merchant to those who have to use it. Drop off charges, pick up charges, poor check in area, dirty, too small, security area too small for passenger numbers, poor food quality and over priced at its restaurants, poor and insufficient seating for passenger numbers and a baggage reclaim area from the arc.International airport more 3rd World shack",1
971,I never thought it was possible for an airport to be in a worse state than Luton. Departed from T3 and past security there is no where to sit.  Big queues just to pick up a sandwich in WH Smith’s. Clearly the airport is taking on more flights without having the infrastructure in place.,1
972,"This airport seems only interested in taking your money and not giving good customer service. I wish they as much effort into a good customer experience as they do to squeezing in ever more retail units at every point of your check in and return. Jet2 check in was fast and efficient. Security slow and took around an hour. Toilets smelly. On return travelators and one of three large lifts not working. Ironically the queues actually mean you rush past all those shops and have to eat fast to make the gate on time. Now they charge you to drop off customers.Grubby, grasping place, avoid if you can",1

Unfortunately on my last visit when car was returned to me and it looked it had been in a rally completely splattered in mud this is what I wold expect from the many cowboy companies and not the official meet and greet.The most disappointing thing is I emailed a complaint the the meet and greet and Manchester airport, they did not reply of even acknowledge receipt of my email.",2
974,There is no pick up area now at the airport that does not incur an  extortionate charge. It cost me £4 just to enter the T3 Arrivals Car Park to pick a waiting family member. My total stopping time to pick up was 9 seconds; that's 44p a second or an hourly rate equivalent of an eye watering £1600!,1

976,"Having worked in the security industry prior to retirement I am appalled by the manner in which the travelling public are treated by the 'search staff' at Manchester Airport. I was with my grandchildren on 10/07/2018 when we underwent the security body and hand luggage search. We were spoken to as if we were 'cattle being herded' without any use of simple politeness such as 'please or thank you' When I pointed out to one person who was ordering my 12 year old granddaughter to open her ipad case that they would get more cooperation if they used good manners I got a 'stare' as reply.  I am sure the management are aware of this problem as I have spoken to many like minded travellers who are also upset by the treatment they have received from these people. We all appreciate its a difficult, demanding job which is essential for our safety but there must be a minimum standard, our treatment at the moment  falls well below that afforded to a prisoner in jail!!!",1
977,"Poor service in sorting out problems. After a delayed bag in Milan I was promised by Milan the bag would be sent to Manchester and then couriered to my home address. The bag never arrived but I received 2 voicemail messages from Mcr airport asking me to collect the bag (without leaving a telephone contact number). However I live 100 miles away which is stated on bag baggage form. I contacted Mcr airport general enquiries who put me through to Baggage who said they don't have a number for Aeroflot baggage handlers/couriers, but gave me the number of Swissport who might know. Swissport refused to give me any information on the bag even though they have it, because it came from Milan and suggested I ring Milan! I tried contacting Milan but the service is next to useless and just cuts you off no matter what you do.I contacted Manchester in the dream that customer services might offer to help and get someone to send the bag to me (a huge task!!) and then recharge whoever a massive £5!Yet there is apparently nobody in Manchester I can speak to about it to have it delivered. They just put me through to phones that suggest calling the lines you've already exhausted or waiting for a phone operator who never picks up! All this even though the bag is waiting in terminal 3 Manchester.  It's a complete mess! The Airport itself is overcrowded and disorganised. Choose another airport!",1
978,"A really terrible airport, principally because 9 times out of 10 there are significant delays getting through security/customs. Dreadful face recognition technology which actually slows things down, and what often appears to be severe understaffing. I fly a fair bit and it's by far the worst airport I use. I've got to the point where I actively look to fly from Liverpool or East Midlands if at all possible.",1
979,"Can’t believe the current lack of organisation on the car parks. Went to pick someone up at T1 today. Eventually found a space on the car park and once I had met the people I went to pay. Big queues for the machines especially as one wouldn’t accept cards. Taxi driver said it never does so obviously a long term fault. Been there less than 1/2 hr so my charge showed as £4. Unfortunately didn’t have enough cash. Nipped outside and got cash off my wife, just enough between us. Put my token back in.....now £6.50. Guy on the intercom reduced the fee when I explained. Came outside to complete and utter chaos. None of the barriers were working to get off the car park. They were eventually raised to allow everyone out, paid or not. Traffic trying to get into the airport was affected and was log jammed up to the motorway roundabout. Two weeks ago when I went it was queued back all the way down the motorway spur to the M56 main carriageway. I can see why they now charge for drop off but.......the idea was it would improve traffic flow around the airport! Not sure what on earth has gone wrong. I use the airport every month on average as well as picking people up in between. What was reasonably well organised is now chaotic. When I come to book next years flights I will use Liverpool where possible. Hope easyJet carry on flying to Turkey from a Liverpool as that will be my first choice. I understand that the development needs to take place but car park organisation, surrounding roads and passport control are now appalling. Avoid the airport like the plague until they get their act together.",1
980,"When did Manchester Airport become the UK’s worst Airport? It was always very good and our favourite place to fly from. However, the past few times have been terrible, it’s extremely difficult to describe the security without using a lot swear words but it’s absolutely woeful. It took us well over an hour to get through so had very little time to do any shopping or enjoy a few beers. They couldn’t have made a bigger cock up of this place if they tried, security simply isn’t up to the task for a major international airport and is the most stressful, badly organised chaotic start to your trip possible. The queue backed right up to the Jet2 check in area, staff were literally running up and down the queue, covered in sweat to fast track people through as they were going to miss their flights. They were clearly very stressed. Totally understand security being tight in this day and age but Manchester do it in the most inefficient way imaginable, it is a complete mess. East Midlands is far better and will be our airport of choice from now on.",1

982,"I have used this airport numerous times in the last 6 years. I had never had too much of an issue, but recently they had changed the pick-up & drop off system which is rubbish.First of all now it is chargeable. It is not enough that we have to pay more and more on everything on the cheap flights, now this adds to the costs too. But lets put that aside, it is not a new thing that airports charge for that. However how they introduced it, how it works and how much it costs at the end is ridiculous.As someone with foreign roots I have continuously family visiting us from abroad therefore I am quite a frequent visitor at the airport. I have been there over 10 times already this year alone. And here comes the ridiculous bit. I pulled up to the (prior) pick up area and picked up a family member only to have a marshal knocking on my window and threatening me with a £100 fine. There were alerting no signs showing that there was a change! If they introduce something like that they should have big signs up notifying you about it, but no, there was nothing.Secondly they have moved the pick up area, now you have to enter in a car park to be able to pick up someone. Up until now it was easy for me to tell anyone visiting us to get outside of the building, I'll be there. Now I have to park the car, walk into the building myself and meet the person arriving. I don't see how this should decrease the gridlocks. Also this would cost me a fortune.I don't believe there were serious thinking behind this new feature, they just went for the extra money without considering the impact. I also  believe that for family members like mine who are old, don't speak English it can be frightening to deal with all these complications. Either it costs me a lot of money to sort them out or they won't travel. Alternatively I can find another airport but this was the closest one for me with a direct flight option. Still, I will look around.Ohh and almost forgot. The reason I ended up on Trustpilot writing a review is that I have checked out Manchester Airport's official website and guess what, not a word on the change, after clicking around I found the current rules at last and there was only a small reference saying ""from Tuesday the 10th July...""  and that's all. I don't think it is how it should have been done. I may be wrong, but I feel they deserved the one star now.",1
983,"The multi storey car park next to terminal 3 has no trolleys for customers departing, no proper signage as where to park and then walk to the terminal! I have never seen such poor infrastructure at any airport. On top of that the airport parking is ridiculously expensive! Not mind paying if MAG provides adequate facilities.",1
984,"Shocking. Herded like cattle into unpleasant security check area. Staff bored, uninterested and rude. Despite approx 14 security lanes, only 4 or so open, yet the queues were massive and loads of staff stood around chatting or on mobiles. A very unpleasant way to start a holiday. Will do everything not to use this airport again.",1
985,"T1 Parking nightmare Returned on the 30 June 2018 to find car broken in and ransacked. Nobody I reported this to seemed surprised by this. Apparently, mine was one of many in T1 multi storey and I was lucky my car was drivable.The car park is supposed to have some kind of Park Safe assurance but if you read the Manchester evening news (12/7) you will see that a crime spree is happening, and the management are doing nothing about it.",1
986,"Don't bother paying for the fast track security - it cost us £10 to stand in a long queue with only one security gate open - we would have got through faster in the normal queue.Security are unnecessarily rude. They expect you to know that they have made the rules even more ridiculous since you last flew 3 months ago, despite there being no signs to tell you the new rules, then they bite your head off if you get it wrong.T1 is a completely depressing hell hole, the most awful airport terminal I have ever had to endure.",1
987,"Have recently had the misfortune to use Manchester Airport Terminal 1. Manchester Airport never fails to disappoint. The staff have no regard for customer care and experience. Passengers passing through the airport are treated with at best indifference and at worst rudeness.Surprisingly, the only part of the process where you were treated with some respect was security!On our return flight after disembarking from the plane, half the flight were suddenly cordoned off for half an hour whilst another flight boarded with no explanation. Members of staff, when asked what was going on, simply ignored the passengers. The gentleman in front of me was carrying a 2 year old which needed the toilet, and he was ignored when he asked for assistance.We queued for 45 minutes to get through Passport Control.What a great first impression we must make to foreign visitors!!",1
988,"Manchester Airport is the worst airport in Europe that I have ever visited.  It is a dirty, badly organised shambles and a total embarrassment to this country that foreign visitors have to suffer this place.I use Terminal 3 regularly.  All aspects of the airport are dirty, understaffed by surly staff who I have to have some sympathy for and simply don’t provide enough seats, space or facilities for the number of passengers that are herded through it.I had the misfortune to use Terminal 1 this week for a trip to Vienna.  The contrast between Vienna airport and Manchester beggars belief.  Security on the way out was a joke, more than an hour and half to get through at 4 in the morning. On the way back in last night at midnight the queue to go through security was hundreds of yards long.  Again not enough staff or facilities for the amount of passengers.  One of the security guys , wearing a jacket and tie, spotted one of his mates in the queue and jumped him to the front, leaving families with babies in the huge queue in a sweaty non air conditioned terminal.To top it off , after waiting for an hour, for the first time ever I got challenged by a surly border guard asking me my middle name and date of birth .Getting out of the short stay car park is also a joke with few signs to the exit. Manchester airport is a complete joke.  If you can’t deal with the number of passengers then don’t accept the business from airlines",1
989,"Flying out of terminal 1 on a Friday evening We sat at a table full of glasses for over an hour and they were never removed. On looking around were we where sitting we noticed how filthy the stools are covered in dust and showing split drink marks, the base of tables not cleaned in months. then walking  to our gates we noticed how filthy this airport is Management needs to spend some money on getting more cleaners in.",1
990,"Very, very long queues at security 15.00 on a Thursday afternoon.",3
991,"Having Manchester as my nearest airport to my family is dreadful. I have flown into many airports around the world, including tripoli, and I have never been to one as disfunctional, chaotic and stressful as Manchester. If I have a departing flight I wait sometimes over 30 minutes for security, in which we are tightly crammed into a room FULL of people. Then onto the waiting lounges which have rubbish on the floor, overfull bins and once again too many people. On my return back into Manchester, I am not greeted by a small line for passport control, such as other airports. But by a long, noisy wait, with no organisation at all. Please Manchester, just get new management.",1
992,"Terminal 1 security fails the airport. Manchester is by no stretch of the imagination a world class airport. At least 800 people herded in an inadequate room, taking 2 hours to shuffle through for security checking. People were in danger of missing their flights due to the systems’ incompetence. When staff were aware of people being late, they were plucked from the queue, making everyone else even more late!Staff wore no name badges, and advised passengers they would be “punished” by an extra 30 minutes wait if they inadvertently left anything in their bags that needed extra scrutiny (phones etc).I believe security staff actually contribute to possible terror incidents by herding so many people in one small space with no means of escape, whilst awaiting security checks (ie before their bags have been checked.)The airport is also losing out on valuable shopping and restaurant trade as so many passengers have to go straight to their departure gates.",1
993,"Used Manchester Airport park and drive and have used a number of times, never had a bad experience and quick service",5
994,Manchester airport is my favourite airport to fly from by far.,5
995,Booking and entry were a breeze!Just wish the spaces were bigger or some people were more careful around others cars as mine got scratched. Other than that definitely recommended!!,4
996,Excellent service from what I have found to be the most welcoming airport in the country!Keep up the good work!,5
997,Travelling on an early morning flight from Termianl 1 was a nightmare! Only 4 security channels were open and it took almost 2 hours just to clear a very crowded security hall - not good.,2
998,I was very happy with every aspect of the parking. I will definitely be using this service again.,5
999,"easy parking and navigation to terminal 3, really pleased, excellent experience.",5
1000,Ready the survay but a lick of paint may help !,2
1001,"The onsite clayton hotel was very good and the driver was very helpful, the baggage check in  was quite good,  the fast track is a waste of time, the security check point was chaotic, the staff just balled instructions at people making no sense, they just confused people, which then meant your hand luggage was then ransacked and rescanned, any body would think you were going in prison not on holiday, calm instructions would be more clear and easier to understand, the return journey from ibiza was a dream in comparison, so much easier and pleasant, never again Manchester.",2
1002,"Convenient, Friendly and so easy to use. I always recommend this service for the ease and convenience of taking a few steps between dropping off your car and into the terminal.",5
1003,The worst experience to start a holiday - it was appalling from check-in to getting on the plane - your treated like cattle,1
1004,"Excellent facilities and helpful staff, which made a great start to our holiday!",5
1005,"Once we’d found the car park, the overall experience was very good",4
1006,"Jet Parks 3, 50 minuets wait for bus to airport over an hour for airport to car park appalling service and stroppie bus drivers avoid pay extra for non airport parking",1
1007,"Airport parking great but Terminal 2 arrivals was terrible, one hour to get off the plane is unacceptable",4
1008,I wish this entire airport was in London I’ve never been anywhere where people collectively are so happy and friendly.,5
1009,The process for picking keys up on arrival back at M&G is excellent and speedy which is helpful when you “just want to get home”,4
1010,T1 baggage check queues were massive when we went in early June. Very frustrating.,3
1011,Good parking experience. Swift process fo transfer through departures,4
1012,"Since BA have reduced the number of flights to LHR I am forced to use Manchester as a point of departure. I have used Manchester also for many, many years both for business and also for private travel. Firstly the organisation for both outbound security and inbound border control is like traveling though a 3rd world airport, there is never enough staff in your security areas, I see this weekly and I see how overworked they all are and the pressures they are under to process each passenger, may security lanes are closed due to lack off staff and I know this because each time I come through I make my feelings heard, It is nothing short of a disgrace. On the inbound again there is never enough staff manning the passport machines and I know this is most likely down to Boarder Control but even so this reflects so bad on the airport and It does not matter what time of day you arrive, it is always chaotic.I must say that currently Manchester Airport must be one of the worst airports in Europe if not the world for organization and lack of staff, and believe me I have been to some stressful busy airports. It is so sad to see this, Manchester Airport is the main airport for the northern part of England and yet it seems to be run in a very poor manner, I must now question if lack of staff and your over queuing for both security and border control is done on purpose so that they generate extra revenue through the FastTrack system.",1
1013,"Meet and greet made the parking experience easy. NOT a fan of the self check in- label your own bags, it was like a cattle market",4
1014,"The meet and greet service at Manchester airport is exceptional! Due to complications with my flights and airline strikes I arrived a day early for my car and naturally it wasn’t ready for collection. The staff however were so friendly and understanding, and they got my car to me as quick as they could and with a smile too. Truly grateful for their upbeat and friendly attitude.",5
1015,The airport management is completely out of touch with customer service. They don't even acknowledge email complaints let alone give a substantive response.,1
1016,"Carpark was good , just surface you are pulling cases over not good",4
1017,"Meet and greet is great, checking sometimes slow but overall the airport is good",4
1018,Clean airport staff helpful signs well posted Private lounges very good no complaint at all,5
1019,In general the experience through Manchester airport was relatively smooth. The only disappointment being the chaos at security flying out! We paid for fast track yet still queued for 45 minutes to actually get to it! Others who hadn’t paid for fast track were ushered in front of us due to the long queues with people having been in the queue so long they were at risk of missing their flight!,4
1020,"Good airport. A very busy airport which has served its purpose each time I have flown. Efficient, modern and secure.",5
1021,poor condition of car park T1/3 long stay and difficult walk way to the terminal.,2
1022,Very good experience and things are getting better,5
1023,"Takes ages to get through security, otherwise a good experienvce",2
1024,"Really good airport we come from Nottingham about a 2 hour drive really easy to get to. We flew from terminal 3 meet and greet the first time service was amazing easy to find easy to park easy to the entrance of the airport. Next time we went we flew from terminal 1 and it was a nightmare almost missed our flight because of poor direction, the signs wasent clear for meet and greet at all was so unorganised.",3
1025,A very efficient and convenient way to park,5
1026,Excellent service from start to finish. Park up then a two minute walk to check in whilst somebody else looks after your car. Perfect.,5
1027,FROM THE SMILING AND HELPFUL STAFF DIRECTING YOU IN THE PARKING PLACE IT IS ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO USE MEET AND GREET,5
1028,first time useing car park overall very happy no waiting from family to be picked up,5
1029,on the whole a satisfactory experience.no problems.,4
1030,Overall a positive experience parking at and flying from Manchester Airport. A couple of minor areas where improvements could be made but nothing that caused a major problem.,4
1031,Traffic management at the airport during roadworks is abysmal. Took an hour of crawling in first gear to exit the site last week - after flight delays and the usual horrors of travel.,1
1032,Carparking is really expensive and seems to go up every time I use it although the service is very good,4
1033,"Great parking for the price - the car park had many potholes however which made driving round unpleasant. Also, entrance/exit it is not token controlled like stated on the booking confirmation instructions.",4
1034,Meet and Greet is cheaper than 2 taxi’s and so easy to use. Just drop you car right near the doors for departure and pick them up right outside arrivals. I’ve never had a bad experience and I have never had to wait more than 5 minuets..,5
1035,Always easy to use and efficient... use them over 20 times a year for business and never had an issue.,5
1036,"Took my Granddaughter and friend to see them off for a weeks holiday, parked in the multi storey and it cost £9.50 for about 1hour 5 minutes. 10 minutes of which were wasted looking for a pay machine, which we found after first finding and asking an airport employee. If we had paid within the hour it would ""ONLY"" have cost £6.50. It is a disgusting, disorganised place that is there to rob people of as much money as possible. It is really a shame I have to give 1 star.",1
1037,"Good airport, allways fly from here, for disabled children with autism Needs to improve a lot, baggage carrasoul need to end the beeping notices to alert that it is in use. As was causing issues for our son. Also the aiport custom for passport could do with going on training for disabled children wearing a lanyard which tells the airport staff that they are disabled, as our daughter looked under the glass to see the guy and he told her she shouldn't be doing that and to stop it as private information. Thought this was rude and could have been nicer to her than being abrupt",3
1038,great service a bit expensive but worth it to come back of your holiday and get in your car thanks,4
1039,"Excellent service, despite the fact that the ANPR could not pick my car plate number. The duty assistant let me in after giving him my car details. That was good of him for understanding that I had a flight to catch.",5
1040,Very easy and close to the terminal,5
1041,"Excellent service, the buses was very frequent & the drivers was very helpful. I would definitely use this service again.",5
1042,The pre-pay multi story is a great hassle free option,4
1043,traffic around the airport was slow with roadworks being done at a busy period of the year. entrance to jetparks 2 has been moved and signage was poor with this information. everything else was as expected. will still be using on our next visit.,3
1044,Return bus was an hour wait and rang customer service but he was unpleasant and unhelpful.,1
1045,The main entrance to the car-park is a bit confusing to find with the new road layouts,4
1046,Great parking - prices could be more competitive,5
1047,"Extremely happy with Manchester Meet & Greet, good service & convenient",4
1048,Terminal two long day signage is poor and when we returned our car was full of brick dust from the building works that are nearby,2
1049,Nice airport,5
1050,Fantasic service would highly recommend and will be using again,5
1051,Meet and greet easy to find located next to terminal car waiting upon return,5
1052,No spaces . Took 30 minutes to finally get a vacating spaceNo lifts down to departurePoor signs at arrivals to find the lifts back inPretty dire overall never again !!!,1
1053,"Manchester, would thoroughly recommend it. Really helpful staff.",5
1054,Excellent choice of flights at more realistic prices than smaller airports. Just leave extra time for getting through security as can be very busy and time consuming,4
1055,1st time using and overall excellent experience. Will certainly use again!,5
1056,"overall experience of Airport was good but ""meet and greet"" (no meeting and no greeting) parking experience poor (A bit like a cattle market)",3
1057,"We pre booked at T1 Multi Storey in advance for a weeks holiday but on entry the car park was full.  About 15 cars were driving round looking for a space and after driving around for more than 30 minutes we eventually had to leave the car in a yellow hatched area so we did not miss our flight.  a very stressful start to our holiday.  As we left the car park, cars were still being allowed entry in spite of the fact the car park was totally full.",1
1058,"Whenever we travel from Manchester Airport, we find the experience easy and stress free, it is well staffed and there is plenty to occupy you whilst waiting for your flight.",5
1059,It's so much easier to on site park at Manchester airport. I always use the multi storey to avoid a bus transfer. It's great to be able to jump in your car and head home on your return.,5
1060,"I travel the world regularly and I would rate Manchester International Airport as below average at best. The car parking experience is absolutely disgusting having prebooked T1 multistorey and having to spend 90 minutes driving up and down the totally full car park along with between 10 and 15 other increasingly frustrated drivers. It was only because our flight was delayed that we did not miss our flight.Appauling experience, one which I will relay to everyone I know",1
1061,No quibble easy to book pay and safe,5
1062,"Friendly helpful stafff even when dealing with huge queues at security, all staff we encountered made the airport experience the best it could possibly be.",5
1063,Tricky to access when road is closed in middle of night and there are no diversion signs.,3
1064,"Cannnot fault the whole experience. I have used meet and greet at terminal 3 before so I knew I would receive excellent service but this time was by far outstanding. I have twin 2 yr olds, 7 yr old and my husband with a guide dog. I’d booked assistance from the airport but they hadn’t arrived. A member of the car park team helped us over to check in and ensured OCS took over from there. I could not of managed without her help! Upon return my car was parked close to the exit so I could safely load up. Would definitely recommend",5
1065,"Excellent service, my flight was delayed 18 hrs, I telephoned to explain, they assured me it was not a problem and as I had notified them, they would not charge me, as it was something out of my control, they checked my flight so my car was ready to collect when I landed.",5
1066,"Jet Parks Ringway over priced, rough ground, bus transfer far too infrequent, drivers abrupt. T1 security is far too small and slow",2
1067,As a UK airport its above standard but other countries especially in the middle East are making this and other airports look dated and lacking in a modern world.Why is it that we have to be treated like cattle when going through passport control? Not enough facilities or staff for the amount of passengers at times.,3
1068,Car park and bus service could be improved at this airport. We had problems entering and exiting the car park and the bus service wasn’t great to and from the terminal. We waited a while for a bus and when the bus did turn up it was full and so nobody could get on to return to the car park. We ended up taking a half and hour walk with two young children back to the car.,3
1069,I returned to find my car damaged whilst in the care of the car park. Unfortunately due to the position of the incredibly deep scratch I did not notice until I got home. It is increasingly difficult to contact anybody about the matter and has been over a week since I submitted an online complaint. Still no response. When I finally did get through to someone they implied that my complaint wasn’t genuine within one minute of the phone call  which is incredibly upsetting - they hadn’t even asked my registration number yet. Such a disappointing end to an otherwise very positive experience.UPDATESince posting this review the airport got back to me and are unwilling to check CCTV to tell me how the damage occurred - even if it was another member of the public who scraped my car. Disgusting service DO NOT USE,1
1070,good service and easy access from airport. Pretty handy,5
1071,As expected car park,4
1072,"Car parking was pre booked,turned up parked up and away I went. On return got on the bus to the car park got off at my stop. Got in the car and home I went",4
1073,Airport road works mean some delays in travel from car parks to airport so leave a little extra time. Overall good.,4
1074,Very good considering the amount of work being done,5
1075,A very positive experience.All staff were very helpful and we had a stress-free start and end to our holiday.,5
1076,"Excellent safe car parking, very reasonable rates and peace of mind while you are away with one less thing to worry about in return",5
1077,"The overall terminal experience was acceptable (although the time to deliver baggage is awful) but the road traffic management system I encountered when trying to start my journey home was appalling.On Friday 1 June 2018 I collected my car from the T3 Meet and Greet Car Park (which is a good service) at 23:00 but it took me until 23:35 to get off the airport site because the access to the M56 (the main route out of the airport) was closed and the traffic management system was appalling.I don't know whether the restriction of access to the M56 was an overnight closure but, if so, it was ridiculous; the volume of traffic was such that any closure should have been delayed.I have to use Manchester again in August and if my last experience is repeated I shall make alternative travel arrangements in the future.",2
1078,"Was professional from the start, only issue was finding where to pick up my keys after the holiday was over..",5
1079,"Confusing approach, meet and greet good, airport check in as expected, wait at security as expected, toilets grubby, food areas need clearing more regularly.",3
1080,One of the best airport experiences in the UK,4
1081,"It's a good idea to have a map of the overall site and surrounding areas if you are parking at one of the carparks.  I had an awful time trying to locate Jetparks 2 and kept on ending up back on the motorway.  Only just made the flight, not helped by the long queues and long waiting times going through security.  The staff did their best to keep things going, but it was stressful.  Hopefully once all the roadworks and improvements are finished it will be much better.  Not sure when the final date for that is.",3
1082,"Trying to get to the car park was awful with long waits in lines of traffic, poor road infrastructure to get to the car park and then the automated system tried to over charge me for the stay claiming I had staid an extra day.",1
1083,Easy to book and find the carpark. Not so easy to find a carpark space.,4
1084,I used meet and greet for the first time and found the whole experience so easy and well run. I will certainly use it again next year and fully recommend them,5
1085,"Hopeless process, no number plate recognition, had to scan the QRC code and received a plastic token. On departing the carpark, the token did not work, had to spend 10 minutes waiting for someone to answer the phone whilst waiting at the barrier.The plane arrived at T3 and there was no one at the airport to operate the Passenger Boarding Gantry. After a 20 minute delay a set of steps arrived and pushed into place.MAG is a dirty and shabby airport.",1
1086,"We waited well over 40 mins for bus each time. Two buses arriving together on both outbound and return journeys, one bus overfull the other empty.. Almost missed our flight - totally stressful and unpleasant experience.",1
1087,Its been better in the past - maybe we picked a bad time to fly.,3
1088,"Picked the car up to find a small mark on the passenger door, still waiting on a reply from Manchester airport.",2
1089,Park and Ride works a dream. I have tried cheaper park and ride and find I was waiting for my car to come. Here its there waiting for you just a short walk from terminal.,5
1090,"No clear signage to T1/T3 long stay as you enter the airport, which looks now like a building site. Scanner did not work on arrivial at carpark. No places left to park the car apart from 'premium' spaces near the barriers - it was only because a bus driver shouted at us after 20min driving around carpark aimlessly that 'of course we could park in the premium spots' that we did so - no info onsite or on our booking at all about this. No info of bus service at bus stop. No clear directions how to walk to T1 and how long it would take. On exit the barrier suggested a charge of £92 even though I had pre-paid for £65. On balance, go somewhere else...",1
1091,Check in takes too long and security is an unpleasant experience.  Nothing to do with the staff who seem professional and pleasant there just is not enough of them,3
1092,"A pleasant airport compared to most i've been too, but terminal 1 is looking a little tired these days! And long stay of site parking could do with much better signage.",4
1093,"We paid for Fast Track passes to get through security check in faster for T1.  However, the lines on the day the departed were big.  We went through the fast track channel and no-one checked out fast track tickets.  This leads me to believe that lot of non fast track people were in the queue.  The queue was very slow, and we were at least an hour in the queue.  When getting to the scanner, the channel only had one scanner, and the main non fast track queue had nearly cleared.  The situation was not helped by members of staff smirking as they walked past the line, obviously finding the situation amusing.  Common sense would have been to utilize a scanner from the normal queue to the fast track line, to even out the flow.  This has definitely put me off using Manchester Airport again.",1
1094,Highly recommend M & G at terminal 1 but first floor check in coupled with ground floor security is a dreadful experience.,3
1095,"The works going on around Manchester Airport complex at the moment are a disgrace. Roads closed off, petrol station closed, access to the motorway taking 20 minutes at 9.15pm at night. Avoid using this airport until they consider the user during the work they are doing. Completely unacceptable level of service",1
1096,"Excellent service, location and staff, perfect for my young family as so easy to use and close to the terminal. Already booked for August",5
1097,"Never had any trouble getting to or from the airport, departures have been on time. Use the official Terminal Meet and Greet Parking. I've found to be only a few pounds more than the off airport  parking and so much easier exiting the terminal and straight to your car. Also no worries about losing your car keys.",5
1098,"Worst airport ever, hard to find car park , took over an hour to get through security , nowhere near enough staff . Paid for VIP lounge , was filthy and food choice very poor ..Not one member of staff was pleasant , Never again !",2
1099,Friendly staff on arrival made this service stand out...easy to use and stress free!,5
1100,My the best car park,5
1101,Pre booked car park but no available spaces. Poor road signage since roadworks made it difficult to find the long stay car parks,2
1102,Excellent airport when flying always try and get flight from there,5
1103,Good service,4
1104,car parking at jet park 3 poor waiting times buses full to the brim,3
1105,very Good Experience for parking and leaving our car knowing that it was secure and not parked in a field,5
1106,"Overall experience of Manchester airport and parking were very good , and staff very helpful .",4
1107,Brilliant service and friendly staff. Cannot find fault and highly recommend.,5
1108,Overall good experience although customs always feels a bit frantic and luggage can be slow on return. Good facilities in departures and food outlets,4
1109,"Hopeless....Simply can't cope with the number of passengers, especially at half term.Over an hour queues for fast track security lane (that's £40 wasted!)£16 for an English breakfast with coffee (awww come on).2 Hour queues at passports coming back.    Immigration in T1 is quite simply 'dingy'.    I actually feel sorry for the staff who work there!There's been building work and road works at Manchester airport for probably 20 years.    My meet and greet car was left on a building site with an exit that was cordoned off.   Took 15 mins to work out where the actual exit was!!Its an airport designed in the 1970's that simply has no room to properly expand.",1
1110,When something was wrong leaving the car park the attendant on the call button basically accused me of lying as to how I entered the car park in the first place.,1
1111,"Easy drop off. Landed back at 5am after a 8hr over night Flight. Staff couldn’t locate our vehicle, took about 15mins to locate, staff had labelled the keys up wrong. Overall despite the slip up will use again as easiest with young kids.",4
1112,Average service prices increases each time we go away.,3
1113,"The whole experience on this occasion was marred by the non arrival of the bus taking us back to the car. We could find no way of contacting the bus company, but in the end after an hour the driver of an out of service bus agreed to take us to the car park. We were utterly exhausted by the time we arrived home.",2
1114,Ok except our flight was delayed. This wasn't so bad but we were called to board on then left standing in a queue for nearly an hour. Would have been better to leave us in the comfort of the departure lounge,3
1115,great car park but arrivals after midnight are rubbish and frustrating after a 5 hour flight - when are they going to have the escalators  from  the easy jet arrivals gate  working at night ?,3
1116,We had our car broken into the response was basically tough ! After finally getting hold of a human being !!!Getting hold of anyone is so stressful and different This added to our stress No one has got back to us as said either !!!Awful,1
1117,"we always use   the official meet & greet at manchester airport our car is always parked up in a bay ready for us to collect it . on return to manchester  airport.    this is our 4th time using this sevice , staff there greet you with a smile &  are always polite .",5
1118,Not enough facilities Bus service times state 10 mins was over 25 mins,3
1119,"Terminal 2 is clean, well ordered and easy to navigate.",5
1120,"easy to find and park.  out of last 4 visits 3 times had ot get assistance at exit due to number plate registration not working, but quick helpful assistance.  pricing of car parks seems quite random.",3
1121,Chaotic and overcrowded. Hostile passport control. Sparse and ambiguous signage. Contrasts very poorly with most major western airports. I will go out of my way to avoid flying from and to Manchester in future.,1
1122,"A bog standard airport.There's nothing to really complain about, although aircon around the security lanes would be a massive boost, but likewise there is nothing to shout about. It's a fairly small airport with limited seating/eating options in the central departure area - although plenty of seats nearer the gates.Staff are efficient and polite.I'd have no issues flying from Manchester again, but I also wouldn't pick this airport over any other (i.e. BHX, EMA, LHR etc.)",3
1123,Allow extra time for all the roadworks at the current time.,3
1124,Massive queues at security EVERY time. Fly around 12 times a year through here and they are always ridiculous. Not enough staff and bad process of searching your bags when they go into a massive queue and involve too much messing about,1
1125,"Tawdry, incompetent experience",1
1126,Current constriction work causes some issues. Signage could be much improved.,3
1127,Car parking fine apart from unhappy bus driver on our return could do with a bit more people skills.,4
1128,"Departure:1. Luggage system problems, so it took 1.5 hours to queue and check in bags.2. Security control had backlog of people from the above problem, so it took 1.2 hours from start to finish. Staff negative and unhelpful. With people likely to be late for flights they tried to fast track them in a very unorganised way and this then had knock on effect to others! With the time taken above, it meant that we then had to walk straight to our gate and no time to seat and take a break.This process unsettled our children! Arrival:Passport  control took 1.3 hours from the entrance to exit after the passport check!Chaos as 3 flights joined the passport control hall, no clear control!13  passport control booths, 1 for non-eu and 6 for eu families! After 1 hour a man in a suit came out of the office and walked a short distance at the exit side of the passport control booths - then with in 5 minutes, 3 more passport control booths opened up?Ideas to help improvement:1. Time and motion study of the security and passport control would visualise the problems and simple no cost changes would have a big impact to improve the efficiency of these areas.2. Positive and helpful attitude of staff would improve engagement and wellbeing.",1
1129,"This is a busy airport, easy to use,with excellent transport links, good facilities, straightforward security and boarding areas and easily accessible information. More seating would be helpful. The airport staff are almost always helpful efficient and pleasant.",4
1130,"I always fly out of Manchester however my last 3 trips (June 2017, November 2017, May 2018) have put me off! The security queue is absolutely horrendous, took almost an hour so had no time to shop in dutyfree which is a real shame as shops must lose a lot of revenue, no time for a coffee or bite to eat so not a great start to a holiday when you have to board a flight feeling rushed and flustered. It didn't feel so bad last year as I was flying with Emirates which meant had great service onboard but on this occasion I was flying with Easyjet so it meant no flight meal and just rubbish snacks.",3
1131,"Busy airport, it is some queues and distance to walk around. Most of the time average delays of the flights is 20 min. Overall it's a good airport.",4
1132,Using the motorway network and actually following the motorway signs for Manchester Airport then signs for your terminal building the journey will be trouble free and to make your journey complete use the Meet & Greet facility the staff are friendly and helpful,4
1133,"brilant facility wouldnt park my car anywhere else, i have never had any problems with this car park",5
1134,"Stress free, good value for service",5
1135,"Great Airport potentially  when construction work is finished, at moment it’s Chaotic",4
1136,"My car was damaged whilst with Meet and Greet. The passenger door handle was loose in its housing and there is damage to the front moulded mudflap and adjacent body panel. The wheel arches were caked in some kind of pale mud. The staff on duty would not help (""above my pay grade"") and there was no manager present. Having returned with my family on an overnight trans-Arlantic flight, we could not wait around all day. I have raised this online as suggested 3 times now, with no response. The damage to the car is bad enough, but lack of accountability is completely unaccaptable.",1
1137,"Apparently there are more than one short stay car parks close to terminal 3, so make sure you find the correct one as I was hit with a £120 exit fee as I used the wrong one even though I had showed an attendant my booking pass on arrival. The attendant I spoke to via the intercom, pointed out my error but would let me exit, (this time only).",3
1138,"Great service, easy to use",5
1139,"Clean, well marked, and easily navigated. Issue with baggage at arrivals but was dealt with and we were on our way home.",4
1140,Waiting times for security and passport control are hideous.,2
1141,Fast car park experience through meet and greet with a decent price as well. Can’t fault the parking - just wish security was as smooth!,5
1142,An excellent and super efficient service which I will be using again every time,5
1143,This was a parking day to forget,4
1144,Terminal 3 is getting to be a depressing place to depart from. Too many queues in an increasingly antiquated building.Meet and Greet car parking is very good.,3
1145,"Horrendous roadworks around the area of the airport, no spaces in the carpark that we paid £60 for, no attendents to help, poor signage through the works and all the signs that have the phone number for help have been ripped off! Very poor experience, I won’t go to Manchester airport again while the works on T2 are happening.",1
1146,"Long queue of traffic to get into the airport, which, if we hadn’t left plenty of time could have caused us to miss flight; it’s inconveivable that getting into the airport by car is so difficult and so slow. It caused delays getting out in return as well as the bus to our car park was delayed. Once we had arrived we were pretty underwhelmed by the facilities and infrastructure prior to going through to departures. That said, a good choice of restaurants and shops once you’re in the departure lounge.",2
1147,Carparking & facilities are good. Queues to enter back in to the UK are usually a nightmare.,4
1148,Overwhelmed and understaffed. Pity the energy that goes into developing the retail areas isn't matched by staff to passenger ratios in security etc and number of slots to security screening is insufficient. Altogether a stressful underwhelming start and end to a journey,2
1149,"Great meet and greet facility ,check in and shopping/food offers. let down badly by the slow and badly organised security check.",3
1150,Booked premium car parking ... made my experience a whole lot better with transporting cats over to Europe. A hassle free experience,5
1151,If using an out of airport car park make sure you allow enough time to catch your flight. Long traffic queues caused by roadworks. Manchester airport getting too big. Need more staff.,3
1152,"Getting from departures, through security etc. to the plane was quite frankly a ""pain in the neck"".",2
1153,Entering the meet and greet entrance was not fully recognisable not enough signage but when I found it my experience was a good one and would definitely use this facility again,4
1154,Check in and security too busy - not enough staff to deal with numbers of customers.,3
1155,"First time using meet and greet and will definitely be using it again, it was so easy",5
1156,Easy access to car park and bus to the terminal,5
1157,"Access to airport confusing due to never ending construction work, pre paid car park was full hence I spent a frustrating 30 minute drive round looking for a space and have to drive to the short stay car park.  Security was efficient but that was because I had purchased a fast track ticket.  Departure areas in T3 packed and nowhere to sit.  On the whole a pretty grim experience.",1
1158,"Worst airport in major cities in Europe. Congested (VERY!), decrepit, too many bolted-on adjustments. Badly under-invested. Extremely poor facilities. A total embarrassment.",1
1159,I paid extra for premier parking in the short stay car park in T3. I was promised ease of parking near the terminal. When I arrived all the spaces were full and I had to spend nearly 40 minutes trying to find a normal space. I nearly missed my flight and had to sprint all the way through the terminal to just make boarding. So  much for the extra money I spent. terrible service and I won't be using it ever again .,1
1160,Great experience of travelling and parking,4
1161,going baggage control at any airport can be tiresome but Manchester make it a drama. Huge queues moving at a snails pace with staff constantly on your back to move along to a non existent space and talking to clients in an irritated tone. Lots of anxiety being created and for children the experience felt fraught and at times frightening.,2
1162,Overall Manchester is the best in the uk however due to all the road works around the airport and the ammout of traffic at this time makes it difficult to find your way around .,4
1163,"Good Airport, BUT needs to concentrate on the basics better. Security is way too slow. Check In's can be way too slow. Queues in the food halls are regular. So if you want a stress free time, you're having to arrive minimum  2 hours before and if you have family/kids make it 3. Pitty as some parts of it are really good.",3
1164,"Parking in T2 multistory is straightforward and is 2 mins from check in hall. So no wandering about in the rain or waiting for car park buses. This is especially nice on your return, when you just want to get home. We used Escape Lounge prior to departure. Wasn't too busy, food was good and drinks service prompt. A very relaxing and enjoyable start to our break.",4
1165,Great would use again,5
1166,"Quick & easy to use, no fuss...",5
1167,Jet Parks shuttle buses are few & far between that's all you need on your return form a holiday is a long wait at a bus stop with no information on when the next bus is due.,3
1168,Meet and greet excellent.  Terminal mainly clean etc just arrivals passport slow and security staff on check in lack in their approach to customers.,5
1169,"There are not enough transfer buses. I waited almost an hour to return to car park (longer that the flight!). Also, the chalky car park surface left my car in a rather dirty state.",2
1170,"Great facilities and conveniently located, but make sure you leave early as the car park entrance at terminal 3 is a nightmare to find (even with a Sat Nav) ... we drove around for 10 minutes and in the end we found the entrance by chance!Better signage is needed. I am comparing it to the car park at Toulouse airport which was perfectly sign posted and very easy to find, even though I can’t speak any French.",4
1171,Good service if a little pricey at certain times,5
1172,Easy. Car nice and safe forgot all  about it when away and returned to be able to just jump in it and of home fab,5
1173,Brilliant experience - great end to a great holiday,5
1174,"Easy to get around the airport, to find out were to go, cleanliness of the Airport and the facilities.",5
1175,"1) Not for the first time, my settings were changed (seat, mirrors and steering wheel). leave them alone; they are my preferences.2) Directions to my car on my return were useless. I was told ""It's where the old petrol station was"". How am I supposed to know where that was?3) The exit wasn't signposted and myself and two other drivers had difficulty getting out.This is my second bad experience with this car park and in future it will be easier to give my father-in-law the money I would spend on the car park to take me there and back.",1
1176,"arrived 5.30am for a 7.40am flight to Tenerife, the fact that it took me 1 hour 40 minutes to actually check in due to no staff on the desks is another issue, go to security and once again there is another really long queue to the point we were then being asked to make ourselves known to a member of staff as our flight was boarding, and all because there were only 2 lanes open - no staff, fast forward a week and on my return thanks to all check in desks being manned I was through check in very quickly and since Spanish airports employ sufficient staff,  security was a breeze. I would have thought that getting the passengers through to departures would be in Manchester's interest so that money can be spent.  There is also the added issue of taxi drivers now having to pay £4 for the short stay carpark which is an absolute nonsense, please don't wrap this up and spin it as taking our security seriously it is all about money making. Not a good start to a holiday.  Manchester you could and should do better. Stop cutting corners and employ staff to make our experience much more bearable, making elderly passengers , pregnant women and parents with young children queue for literally hours is disgusting.",2
1177,"hassle free every time, know what to expect and its a first class service. thankyou.",5
1178,Good but building and roadworks cause traffic delays,4
1179,Problems getting out of car park due to amount of cars and congestion even though it was 2.30am.,4
1180,Excellent service .Easy to find going and coming back .Staff pleasant even at 4.00 in the morning !,4
1181,"The airport is improving the experience for the passenger, the car parking staff are excellent",4
1182,"We parked at Manchester Airport for 2 weeks, the parking space was difficult to find, when we did find a space it was quite tight.On our return from our holiday, somebody had driven into it and damaged the car, and left no note (thank you!!). We reported it to customer services who didn't want to know, wasn't helpful at all and told they have no CCTV and we park there at our own risk. On top of this we parked under cover but the car was dirtier than if we had left it in a field for 2 weeks.Use at you own peril",1
1183,Excellent meet and greet service Machine scans car so no waiting and then straight into terminal Would highly recommend,5
1184,"No problem with the airport but the bus service from and to the car parks is not good.  Waiting times for buses is long, we queued over half and hour in hot sun, was expecting 15 mins at the most.  Then it's a long drive around the houses.  Not great,  will use a different method next time or try the meet and greet",4
1185,Only issue we had was the sign for the short stay car park said ssp not short stay parking so we missed it first time around,4
1186,Overall enjoyable experience!,5
1187,Security should be quicker and suitcases on arrival should be a lot quicker as we waited nearly an hour for them early hours of the morning and car parking fees should be cheaper as we were charged £20 for staying an extra day due to making a mistake on the booking but apart from these issues everything else was great.,4
1188,Bad signing and very dated airport. Messy to find the parking and again bad signing.,2
1189,"A simple, hassle free way to start my holiday.",5
1190,Came back and car had flat tyre ok punctures happen but don’t drive the car 5 miles on a flat tyre ruining the tyre and making it unrepairable,2
1191,"Hours to get through customs. Dirty, and rip off car parking prices.",1
1192,"Payed extra for premium parking in T3 car park, no barrier segregation for premium parking so any one can park there. What did I pay for?Fast track, again what did I pay for people were going through the normal channels quicker because at least two passengers in front of me at security insisted on taking enough toiletries in their hand luggage to keep Superdrug stocked for a month. In my opinion they should be immediately directed away from the fast track channel, and not holding up other passengers for 10mins or more.",2
1193,"Not an airport you want to spend too much time in. Apparently it’s won awards, not sure how? It’s ok, better than Luton, Stanstead and Gatwick....just.",3
1194,"When using Terminal 1 with Jet 2 everything is so quick and easy.We use this terminal on most of our trips,have experienced long queues at other terminals and passport control",4
1195,"Manchester airport is a nightmare, getting there, checking in, security and at terminal 2 with all the building work it is horrendous!Coming back passport control is terrible, queues, lack of staff, electronic passport readers that don't work.Baggage claim is not much better.Can't say a good word about it just now and I have to use it regularly.",2
1196,"Having booked to park in Jet Parks 2 I thought it would have been simple to find but it wasn't, there were lots of roadworks happening and even though i had to be at the airport for 4am (so traffic was very light) there wasnt adequate signage to direct me to the entrance to the car park. After 2 attempts I finally found the entrance. If I had done this at a different time.of day I daresay that my stress levels would have been a lot higher than they were. Overall a satisfactory experience.",4
1197,"Ideal location and keep your own keys , works perfect for us",5
1198,"Would look to use Jetparks 1, 2 or 3 next time and not the ringway.  Too fr away and had to wait longer for the bus on both departure and arrivals.",4
1199,My first time at Manchester. I would use it again,4
1200,SOMEONE DAMAGED MY CAR IN THE CAR PARKIT IS DIFFICULT TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE PARKING EXPERIENCEEVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT THE AIRPORTS FAULTEVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT THE AIRPORT WAS FANTASTIC.,3
1201,Very good on the whole but gets busier all the time and queues are getting longer.,4
1202,Great service no problems at all always the same when flying from Manchester,5
1203,"Security is a nightmare. Even with fast track. We paid extra and queued 25 mins. The “free” queue moved faster, and we had plenty of time to observe this.",3
1204,"There is a lot of building work at the airport, which is coming to an end, but the roads into the airport can be a congested at times.  Overall Manchester Airport is a fair airport, having traveled a lot, there is some work to do to bring it up to the likes of Singapore's Changi Airport or Dubia International, but otherwise it is OK.",3
1205,"Difficult to find Jet 3 car park if you don't know the area - inadequate road signs. Car park surface is stone chipped, makes it really difficult to wheel cases to bus stop - needs tarmac. Bus stop was not easy to see in pouring rain. There are major 4 way roadworks around there, allow more time to travel if you don't want to be late.",3
1206,"Excellent car parks easy to find, park up buses every few minutes  And the same comeing home . Go to bus stop . A bus every few minutes back to your car and way home . Great service .just can't fault these car parks . And dead easy to book on line if you make a mistake when booking and don't notice till you print it off don't . No problem just give them a ring and they will sort it for you .",5
1207,Buisy airport. Had a crushed suitcase on my return journey. Meet and greet car parking was very good.,3
1208,"Just like that!We used for the first time meet n greet service, excellent, friendly staff, right on the departure n arrival areas. No waiting for the minibus and miserable drivers, straight in and out, 5 minutes.Used the all inclusive fast track service too for security, in n out of the airport, bish bosh straight through. From Bradford into the departure lounge only 1.5 hours all done.Thanks for making it a little less stressful and only gripe is the fact we have to wait until July for the next holiday..",4
1209,"multi storey car park is only a couple of minutes walk into terminal so no waiting for courtesy buses.     could be a little cheaper than the £90 we paid for 8 days parking !!     and, disabled car spaces could be better advertised.   we ended up having to go to 4th floor, so would be helpful if you could reserve a disabled parking spot on booking.",5
1210,Its an airport the busiest part of the holiday,4
1211,Out of all the airports we have travelled from and to ( bearing in mind some delays are inevitable due amount of people on bigger planes and security) we like Manchester Airport the best and always try to travel from there. The staff are very helpful. Cleanliness is very good.,5
1212,This last trip was a better airport experience for us. staff a lot better in security not so rude and abrupt as they have been. I know it’s a difficult job but a little thought that we are human and not cattle goes a long way.,4
1213,"Its OK, it works. Doesn't surprise or delight and is a downgrade on the appearance compared to many other European airports. Just needs sorting out!",4
1214,Roadworks causing delays to departures even arriving at 4am. Give extra time to avoid disappointment as no prior warning given.,4
1215,Use a different airport if you can,1
1216,jet parks poor,2
1217,Jetparks 2 carpark. Waited from 6am - 7.15am for a bus. Checked in with literally 1 minute to spare. Staff via intercom and bus driver were very rude and unhelpful. Will never use this car park again.  Howver staff at checkin and security were fabulous! They ensured we caught the flight when we arrived with a minute to spare.,1
1218,"I have used this service many times, it works well at less busy times, early in a morning or late in the evening, At busy times the transport busses are very full, and have twice just sailed past us without stopping. Empty busses have also passed us by at shift change times. If you intend to use this service plan in plenty of time for delays especially at busy times. If you need to extend your stay GOOD LUCK using the Customer sevice phone number, which appears to be automated messages on a repeat, pressing option 2 to amend a booking brings up the initial message and you go round the merry go round. The web site is a similar experienceIN SUMMARY - if you don't need to change anything and are travelling at a quiet time, Its a cost effective and relatively stress free experience.If you are travelling at a busy time or may need to amend a booking then prepare to be frustrated.",3
1219,Terminal carparking easy to use if the price is right!,4
1220,"Considering the cost of getting to the airport against the cost of meet & greet parking. Not much difference, but once you arrive, you leave your car more or less at the departure entrance & the same when you return. No need to drag luggage up & down the levels. Just take out the car & go & enjoy your holiday.",5
1221,Very clean and easy access. Online check in wouldn’t let us drop bags 💼 ff early and proceed to escape lounge for 3 hours paid allocation time as wasn’t allowed to check baggage in until normal check in time therefore missed 1.5hrs escape lounge.,4
1222,The improvements that have been made to this car park are excellent. On arrival our number plate was recognised immediately and we were welcomed with a personalised greeting on screen. The staff were very friendly and helpful even at 4am ! On our return we were dealt with quickly and on our way home in a few minutes. I will always use the meet and greet car park at Manchester airport,5

1228,"The use of Jet Parks 3 off site allows you to miss the traffic in and around the airport and continue your journey without any hassle, even with the road works at present.",5
1229,Car parking at most airports is never easy!! Manchester will improve once all works are completed.,3
1230,Appalling customer service at departures. Poorly signed route to security. Security overwhelmed by people. Fast track worked well but my jacket was routed into further investigation because of a fountain pen!!!It took 20 minutes to recover - even though fast track. Service lackadaisical and rude ; no one worried about the delay. I wiill avoid using Manchester whenever I can,1
1231,my reservation was not known at the barrier.,3
1232,Very easy to find helpful staff eas3 to park your car and collect you car,5
1233,The usual excellent service is terrible owing to the road works.,4
1234,"Having used Heathrow and Gatwick for many years whilst living in the South, it has been a great relief to use Manchester in the last 12 years.  We have had few irritations or delays and will continue to use Manchester airport in the future.",4
1235,Flying from T3 before 0900 is not a good experience for business travellers or families with children due to the high volume of stag/hen groups on boozy weekends away.Too much alcohol being consumed at 0500 and the scene reminiscent of bars on a bank holiday weekend!,4
1236,"Terminal One is very old and tired and access to our gate was reached by going up some stairs and then back down another flight of stairs. Not really quite what you would expect at an international airport.However the main terminal waiting area had plenty of seating, shops and cafes and was quite pleasant.",4
1237,"Security experience, arrivals efficiency of ground staff including baggage collection and immigration leaves a lot to be desired. Has to be the worst in Europe...",2

1239,Very easy holiday experience!,5
1240,Excellent  experience in car park and air port facility,5

1242,Current roadworks make arrival and departure a hassle.  Once inside the terminal everything was fine.,3
1243,It's a busy airport but copes well with it.,4
1244,My partially-disabled wife needs wheelchair assistance for access to the aircraft from check-in and from the aircraft to immigration on return. This is easy when the aircraft is docked but a nightmare when buses are required. All aircraft should be docked. Apart from that criticism the airport is first class. I recommend it to all travellers.,5
1245,"Any slowness and tediousness pales into insignificance compared to Munich, Frankfurt and Naples. The German airports may be a little cleaner, but are so difficult to find your way around and are so expensive. Naples is a small airport with a crowded, frantic atmosphere. Manchester IA is just easier to cope with.",5
1246,Good value but needs a little work on tarmac to get rid of hard core surface to aid baggage transfers,4
1247,Excellent.. right next to the terminal. Good price with worry free parking.,5
1248,Superb service - by far the best parking option at Manchester Airport.,5

1252,easy smooth service and we like the discount offers we try to use before hand,5
1253,Great airport a little dated in places. Prices in departure lounge are high as with all airports. Also can be very busy in the bars and restaurants. Eat before you go!,4
1254,"Used the Meet & Greet service for parking our car.  Easy to find.  Efficient drop off - you can even have the car valeted (for a price).  Very easy pick up - no hanging around for transfer buses, etc.",4
1255,"Shuttle driver was very informative but we should have taken more time to take a photo of where we'd left the car as when we got back we knew it was in 819 but not even close to where I thought it was, completely my fault but they sent a pair of Marshalls out and found the car much to my relief and considerable embarrassment!  Great customer service.",5

1258,"Overall experience quite good, but leave yourself time to find parking space",4
1259,"Despite clearly stating the date/time of when I needed to pick-up my car again, MAG got this wrong. Was told that they were expecting me 24hrs later(!) and were going to fish my car out of remote car park where it was still parked. Not good when you land at midnight, have a long drive ahead of you and then have to wait a further 30-40 mins for your car to turn up. The car was also covered in dust / dirt(!) - no idea where MAG had kept it, but clearly not a clean location. Had to pay to get it cleaned the next day. No apology for delay or condition of car from MAG car park staff. Cost of using M&G1 for 2.5 days was almost £50, which isn't cheap. Apparently, that's not enough money if you want a smooth, trouble-free, parking experience - that'll cost extra.",2

1265,Efficient easy parking experience.,5
1266,Easy to find  excellent facilities defiantly use again,5
1267,Was hard to find the multi storey car park! Inside the car park was hard to find the entrance door of the airportReally disappointed,3
1268,Meet & greet is fantastic. Park your car hand in your keys in the office and just a two minute walk to the terminal. We always park here and will never use any other car parks. And after coming through arrivals you pick up your keys and you’re driving off in less than 5 minutes.Very friendly staff directing you in the car park and in the office,5
1269,"No fuss or hassle, just a simple and efficient way to park your car, with no delays at either end, which you experience with 3rd party companies",5
1270,Meet and greet is a great service. When you land you just want to get home so being able to be on the road in just a few minutes is fantastic. Use it every time I travel now.,5
1271,Meet & greet service was easy to use at a reasonable price. Staff very friendly and informative.,5
1272,Very easy to use and saves the hassle of waiting for the park and ride bus!!,5
1273,"Overall, in my experience, the airport operates well and gives good customer satisfaction. Airport staff generally very friendly. Some areas of terminal 1 in my opinion could be improved  particularly for elderly folk. Depending on Gate Number, there are lots of steps to navigate as you go to the aircraft.",4

1275,Very easy to Book. Very easy to find. Overall an excellent experience,5
1276,"New approach to terminal 3 can cause some confusion, particularly if you are trying to find the pre booked short term parking which is opposite the multi story short term parking. Lack of signage when approaching from this direction can cause very expensive confusion. The terminal seems too small for the capacity of passengers. It’s packed, noisy and rowdy seemingly populated entirely by stag and hen parties if you travel at the weekend. Otherwise there’s enough to keep you occupied for a couple of hours although bagging a good seat is a scrum.Staff in security are efficient and friendly.",4

1279,"Good except for the gravel surface of Ringway, which makes transporting luggage to the bus stop a drag.....",4
1280,Hi It’s a pleasure to have Used Manchester airport Thank you P walker,5
1281,Quick check in and the fast track security was well worth paying for,5
1282,Do not eat in the overpriced poor quality restaurants - better to buy a meal deal sandwich from boots!! £35 for a lukewarm to cold burger and pulled pork wrap with 15 chips a piece is a joke!!,3
1283,"Not to clean, badly sign posted, not enough OCS personnel and not all trained well enough.  Immigration was far to slow, it took 45 minutes from the plane landing, for my disabled wife to join me by immigration control.  She and another wheelchair user were being pushed by one OCS person.  When we got through immigration to the baggage area, ours or what I thought was our bag was the only one on the carosel.  Well it was not our case, ours had was missing.  It was found a few hours later on the Friday, but it took untill the Tuesday next week to get to us.  Very little information was given of were it was, ie very little tracking.  I am glad the experience is over, if the holiday companies used another airport I would gladly use them.",3
1284,"Going through any airport  these days is not easy, but Manchester Airport run a smooth operation which makes the whole experience most acceptable even at really busy times.",5
1285,Yeah was very good just was a lot of walking to get through passport control on return and no escalators on .my wife as copd so cant walk to far .didnt realise how far it was as first time going from manchester in about 15 year .,4
1286,as Liverpool is closer future air travel will be via that.,2
1287,Had pleasant experience with Manchester airport.,5
1288,car park not big enough. cannot cope with new dreamliner planes for luggage,4
1289,"Great service from arriving to departing, would use again",5
1290,"Never been to Manchester Airport before.  It was clean, tidy, everything ran smoothly.  Used Meet & Greet parking service - which was excellent.",5
1291,Easy to follow instructions on how to get to the car park and the number plate recognition worked perfectly both in and out,4
1292,"Great airport most of the time, but don't travel on a Saturday as the security checking area is always overstretched with long, long queues.",3
1293,"Quick fast service on line, car park was OK needs resurfacing in some areas but mainly very good, value for money.",4
1294,First time I've used park and ride at Manchester airport but I found the whole experience excellent staff helpful and friendly and the close proximity to airport excellent ease off both dropping off my car and returning at 2 am was excellent will definitely be using this service again,5
1295,Excellent service.  Very easy and stress-free.,5
1296,"Having a disability makes the sometimes exceptional distance from gate to passport control onerous. Being ambulant, I choose not to use assistance as this is needed for passengers in wheelchairs. Unfortunately there is no provision for people in my position",4
1297,Try and make going through security easier and less stressful. Too tiring and feel like cattle.,4
1298,"I travel frequently through Manchester Airport and it's hit and miss as to how quickly you can get through security.  They seem to have started a new system of ""streaming"" where effectively there are 2 separate queues in the line before you get security checked.  SO I join queue 1 and at some point they stop people joining queue 1 and put them into queue 2.  Further down - the 2 queues join up again and cause a bottleneck.  What I noticed as we moved along at a snails pace is that people in queue 2 ended up 20 people ahead of me!  Really ridiculous and frustrating when you are about to miss your flight. I arrived 2 hours before my flight and only JUST made it - and only because eventually they started allowing people with imminent flight times to jump the queue.  By far Manchester Airport is the worst I have experienced at any airport around Europe for how well the logistics seems to operate.",2
1299,Overall a satisfactory experience only hampered on this occasion by all the roadworks taking place outside the terminal and car park.,4
1300,"Easy access, affordable and piece of mind whilst the car is securely parked. I have used the service on my last 3 holidays and would highly recommend.",5
1301,Found security very stressful - staff have little patience and treat most people like suspected criminals.  Some of the staff aren't even polite.  Liverpool is much better for courtesy and so was Dublin from where we returned.,3
1302,"experience in the terminal going out good, not so good on return, not enough people manning passport control when several planes arrive together. other thing was when i went to get my car i could,nt find my way through the parked taxis and vans picking up passengers when i did get to my car i found that it had been damaged at the rear.reported the damage on the airport website and got the impression that they did not want to know i was told to report it to the police. needless to say i will find alternative parking when i use the airport.",1
1303,Generally good but T1 is likely to discourage flying with Thomas Cook,4
1304,No problems at all,4
1305,Ok apart from unacceptable long delays in T1 security checks.,3
1306,great going really easy...coming back there were that many people waiting to go to jet park 3 it took us an hour and 45 minutes until we managed to get to the car,4
1307,Airport is good considering the amount of work in progress. Flight information could be improved by providing more departure screens. Nevertheless customer needs are well catered for.,4
1308,Meet and greet takes stress out of traveling,4
1309,Over all a easy quick experience.  The only problem  was road works at jet 3 car park. This made the transfer bus late.  Having said that the bus driver was very helpful and pleasant. He let his control centre know where he was and if another bus was needed.,5
1310,SMOKING AREAS NEED TO BE BETTER MANAGED AS SMOKERS AT TIMES SMOKE ANYWHERE AND THERE APPEARS TO BE LITTLE OR NO REGARD TO HSE ISSUES RELATED TO THE MANAGEMENT OF SMOKERS,3
1311,Left my window open and they had covered it for me to avoid rain,4
1312,Overall good experience,5
1313,ANPR did not work for us on entry and exit from car park,3
1314,"Long security queues - annoying and dangerous to have such a crowd of people prior to security. People would spend more at the shops and restaurants if they had time!Long passport control queues on arrival - a constant annoyance for regular travellers and an embarrassing welcome to Manchester for any visting tourists. Need to cough up and open more manned desks!The buildings in general are pretty diabolical too, again not the best advert for Manchester on arrival!Your saving grace is your customer-facing employees who are all fantastic, helpful and positive people despite management's inability to implement efficient processes.",1
1315,Excellent service from start to finish.,5
1316,Shocked Have used multiple times in last few years but on return this time shocked how dirty vehicle was. looked like parked in a building site for a week and door dent damage that they are looking into.,1
1317,"Car park may win awards but its not easy or comfortable.  Check in area has no facilities after a long journey, have to wait to pass security.  Arrivals was brilliant, only 20 minutes for cases to arrive.  If I have to go again I would, but only as last option...",3
1318,"Being a disabled passenger and the being our first trip abroad for over 45 years, I was somewhat apprehensive, but the assistance provided was first class.",5
1319,Good experience 1st time. Would recommend and will use again in the future,5
1320,"Efficient, but low value's of communication.",4
1321,excellent service from arrival to departure,5
1322,"Car park is too expensive and even though I park there every time I fly I never use the bus as it is too in-frequent, in fact I walk to terminal 1 and 3 before the bus even arrives at the car park. Never got on it once in twenty years! If Meet & Greet becomes the only parking option then I will get a Taxi instead, that is even more expensive than the long stay car parks! Charges for dropping off is quite frankly ridiculous and the management should be brought to rights over this, this is an Airport partly owned by the Council we already pay towards, daylight robbery!",3
1323,security check needs to be updated queues to long. toilets need to be cleaned more.,2
1324,We have used the meet & great many times & it has always been reliable and reasonably priced.,5
1325,Only thing that I can really moan about is the lack of a dedicated blue badge area for drop off at the meet and greet apart from that whole experience is very good indeed easy to book online and the booking in at reception is easy and straight forward as is collection Would I use it again-yes no worries,5
1326,"Excellent, easy process and staff all very helpful",5
1327,"Things are very good but slight changes could be made,  like getting communication sorted.",4
1328,Used Jet Ringway Carpark at Manchester and it was a great service from the ANPR operated barriers to the bus links to and from the terminal.  Great service.,5
1329,"For an  enormous airport Manchester Terminal 1 is very good.  However, returning from Split which is obviously much smaller was so much easier and less stressful.",4
1330,Excellent premium multi story car parking facilities.,5
1331,"The car park attendants were very helpful. We were flying out from T2, but flying in to T3. When arriving at T3 the kind man told us to go to T2 so we didn’t have to walk with all our luggage and they would take our vehicle to T3 ready for our return which was very kind.",5
1332,"Easy to find,regular bus service to and from,definitely use again,hassle free!",4
1333,"Fast efficient service, easy to find a space and transfer buses quick would highly recommend.Stress free service",5
1334,"T3 is the worst terminal I have every travelled to and from.  Security is slow (Fast Track is 30 minutes plus) ,  Baggage delivery on return is slow, as is customs.Too many flights and not enough capacity or staff to handle the passengers throughput.  Passengers being ""blamed"" for delays due to not removing liquids - rather that accepting that the airport doesn't have enough staff or capabilities",1
1335,Car parking in multi storey excellent but even though we had already checked in on-line we had to queue for ages at the Tui bag drop,4
1336,Passport control/customs could certainly be alot more pleasant.  They have an extremely important job but it costs nothing to smile or say Please and Thank you,4
1337,Efficient and effective  - all aspects,4
1338,Some aspects good but some areas need serious improvement . Some staff need retraining particularly in the security section and assistance support . Car parking generally ok . Better signposting needed particularly on entrance to the airport while improvement are being made . Would avoid this airport like the plague if it could .,3
1339,Always a good experience. Never any problems with the parking. Staff always friendly too.,5
1340,Needs bettter information on emailsParked in the wrong short stay car park due to poor signage and information on email.,3
1341,"The contrast between staff and facilities at Manchester Airport with those offered at other global airports is stark. I would certainly consider using a different airport in future where possible, if anything to avoid the extremely poor security staff and waiting areas.",1
1342,"The service that the airport staff provide is excellent given the volume of traffic, people and flights and problems they have to deal with. I went into the multi storey the wrong side and was panicking re getting parked and to my flight on time, I pressed the help button and spoke to a really helpful man who redirected me exactly in an instant which was such a relief! Very impressed.",5
1343,"Comes across as a holidaymaker's airport and not one for a regular business traveler. Security was worst experience of all UK airports I have used, staff had no sense of urgency or interest; Heathrow might be a nightmare to access but it leaves Manchester a million miles behind with regard to passenger experience.",3
1344,Always had a smooth and seamless experience when travelling through this Airport,5
1345,Generally positive experience using T1 meet and greet at Manchester Airport.,4
1346,"Staff at Manchester Airport were aggressive in guiding passengers through the airport - shouting at you.  Yes it was the Thursday before Good Friday, and a lot of travellers, but it is your job to assist travellers - not treat them like animals.SHAME ON YOU!Also on return to car park after holiday saw youths breaking into a car near to mine in the Jet Parks Ringway.  Supposedly patrolled, didn't see anyone.  Called police as a matter of courtesy.",1
1347,overall really good experience. very pleased.unfortunately there was no cheaper alternative: e.g. parking further away but paying less for my flight.so price aside/ the rest was very satisfactory,4
1348,Manchester Airport is same as all airports. The food and drink price is inflated as they have you cornered. I dont like to think i am being ripped off. The Duty Free is no longer a bargain. You can get things cheeper online or at your local department stores.,4
1349,"very easy no problems at all  drop car off , then car waiting  for you when you return",5
1350,A great service. I would highly recommend anyone to use.,5
1351,"Use meet and great all the time, however this time for reasons unknown to me the drivers have taken it upon themselves to alter every option on both seat including headrest, I get they have to move back and forth but to move lumbar and headrests, and same on passenger seats leaves me little confused, unless of course its been used as a ferry car on one journey which I'm not happy about if it has. Also both sides were covered in road tar again not happy.",3
1352,The whole process of parking is flawless and always works very smoothly,5
1353,Not enough security personnel to deal with an averagely busy airport at the time of departure,3
1354,Love Manchester airport especially terminal 2. Loads of shops albeit overpriced beer and food in the terminal bars.... customs clearance can be slow and painful but overall good experiance,4
1355,Perfect service at the meet and greet car park. No problems in the airport and an easy journey all round helped along by efficient staff,5
1356,Fantstic service with defo use all the time now,5
1357,"The car park cost is absolutely criminal, I paid £39.99 for a 12 hour stay and the system did not even work as it should.  Im unsure of who decided that £39.99 was an acceptable price for a carpark but they need a wage cut!",3
1358,"Very happy with our experience. The airport parking was very busy and difficult to find a space and the airport smoking area is small and stuffy. Other than that transfers, staff and overall experience were very good and efficient",4
1359,Great service few minor adjustments will make it even better,1
1360,"The T3 M&G is a great way of starting your trip in a relaxed way. Efficient and straightforward, in stark contrast to the rest of the airport experience!",5
1361,Sign posting not very good for route from motorway to jet parks 3 and temp. traffic light delays just before entrance.  But service in car park good.,4
1362,Manchester airport security is one of the most understaffed and slowest,2
1363,So simple dropping off and picking up my vehicle with very little walking to and from the airport buildings,5
1364,so much easier with meet and greet especially when returning early hours in the morning defo recommend to anyone leaving car at the airport,5
1365,"Had to wait ages for our cases as usual at Manchester, and need more staff on at arrivals passport control as usual.",4
1366,Long queues at arrival Passport Control......again.,3
1367,"I would like to recommend this company to anyone.The service was really efficient, no stress in looking for a place to park.Just drop and go.Well done.",5
1368,"The best I can say is ‚it’s a means to an end’ Poor service, uninviting, incredibly badly organised security checks (frontline staff begging passengers to complain), poor passport control again not enough staff, sports rarely function properly, and heairport is constantly a building site and looks untidy.The slogan ‘we are changing‘ should read ‚weare changing for the worse.... if that is actually possible‘",2
1369,Excellent service,5
1370,Very easy and you are straight into the departure lounge. Great coming back just take the lift and your straight into the car park. I would recommend this to anyone.,5
1371,"Car park, Terminal 3 Short Stay,  was not difficult to find following instructions provided on the website. However, signposts could be confusing because at the final stage you are direct to T1 and T2. Terminal 3 Short Stay is shown only after taking the T1 and T2 exit, when suddenly T3 Short Stay sign is seen. Parking was easy. Parking surface was well maintained. Registration recognition was efficient both at Entrance and Exit. Problem arose in finding the departure terminals. There was no signpost. I followed a man who appeared to be an employee. Finding the car park on arrival was more difficult because it is not signposted from my Arrivals terminal, Terminal 1.",4
1372,When we picked up our car after a ten day vacation it was not just dirty it was filthy! Would not use this again,1
1373,Won’t be using again. Put me in wrong car park to start with then when got back cost £15 to get out.,1
1374,Can’t do any better than to fly from Manchester,5
1375,"Good, functional, efficient airport, passport control could be improved. Would use again.",4
1376,"Manchester airport is large rambling, noisy, and access to and from the aircraft is often too much of a trek. In recent times, the escalators have often been off.Far too much space is given over to the duty free hall, and far too little space for the security checks, so after waiting excessively in security, one then faces a long forced march through duty free, where prices are generally higher than on most European high streets.Waiting areas are crowded and noisy, but are clean and airy.My only reason to use Manchester Airport is that it is only a 25 minute drive from home. Liverpool and East Midlands provide a much calmer and restful experience.",3
1377,It would be nice to have moving carpets for some of the long walkways. And lifts or escalators where there are stairs.,4
1378,"Expensive, overcrowded,not enough seating. Liverpools bette and easier to transit through.",3
1379,"Although it was busy when we arrived at the airport, we were processed through with efficiency and friendliness.",5
1380,"Good price, near airport.",5
1381,Very easy to use.,5
1382,"Sign posting to the Crowne Plaza hotel was non-existent. Road works very confusing. I could see the hotel but not a way to get to it. However, moving my car from the hotel to the T1 multi-storey car park was easy (the hotel offers stay and park packages but I didn’t want my car parked off-site). Departure was trouble free. However my arrival experience left a lot to be desired due to a temporary disability which was not catered for.",4
1383,Very good apart from the non priority detour for departures,4
1384,"Poor passenger information at check-in, very long wait at security with only 2 of 5 security scanners in use.",2
1385,"Finding the car park was a hastle, getting through securing was a nightmare.",2
1386,Ridiculous abuse of marketting forcing a route March thru duty free maze. Pathetic baggage handling service upon return on just about each occasion I travel. Othr than that it's OK. Don't use meet and greet parking. If you reach to multi story it's ideal.,3
1387,Make sure you don't run over your parking time. I was less than 15 minutes late due to late arrival of plane (over 1 hour) and slow bus service. This cost me another £15.,3
1388,Dirty car on arrival home. Exterior and driver’s footwell very dirty. Overpriced considering I had to valet my car coming home.,2
1389,"The airport has great transport links and is easy to get around. The facilities are been massively upgraded over the next few years, and will further enhance the experience.",5
1390,Excellent service,5
1391,Drop off experience good; Fastpass through security good idea but at 8 a.m. on a Sunday morning doesn't really make much difference.  Finding the car on pick up was a little more challenging (Bay numbers would be a good idea?),4
1392,"The staff at check in (the information people) were very rude but, one we had gotten past them the rest of the airport 'to dos' we very good, we were travelling with small children and instead of having to wait in the big line to go through security they learn you go though a different section, this saved us a lot of time and, more than likely, strops. The lady on security was lovely and made sure that my children did not feel rush or panic when the were to take off their coats and part with their accessories. One in there are plenty of shops and food halls. It is easy to find all the relevant information about your flight, where you need to be and when.Overall it was a much nicer experience than I'd imagined and it was a nice start to our holiday. Upon returning to Manchester it couldn't have been simpler, very easy to find where you need to be and where to collect your luggage, we travelled out of season so it was really quiet, I would imagine it would be a lot busier during peak times.",4
1393,"I have used this M&G car park several times. The location can’t be better for T1,just cross the zebra crossing and you are there. The staff are very helpful and friendly. Just park up and hand your keys in at the kiosk.",5
1394,"Carpark is easy to find, bus service should be increased, carpark surface is rough on luggage.",4
1395,On arrival discovered my flight was delayed for at least 12hrs offered the option to cancel the flight with refund. 4 days booked in the multi storey car park used it for 90mins. No facility to complain or no process to attempt a refund in the circumstances very very poor,1
1396,Great easy process no messing around or waiting for anyone in and out very easy,4
1397,Great airport for many destinations and offers a wide range of facilities.Security Control does need to be faster - much quicker at LHR/LGW,4
1398,Its a car park convenient means you can set your own time rather than relying on others for travel,5
1399,"Seamless trip, very easy.",5
1400,Very easy and seamless experience would definitely recommend.,5
1401,Have always experienced a Very Good service from Manchester Airport including Car Parking,5
1402,Leave home allowing plenty of time for your flight.,3
1403,No problems at all - excellent.,5
1404,"Security baggage checks can take longer than other airports and not sure why. Having said that, never cease to be amazed at the idiots who seem oblivious to restrictions on liquids etc., and as a consequence, delay everyone.",4
1405,"Airport too big even for reasonably fit pensioners.  Outward journey okay but, on return, seems a very long walk to passport control and luggage collection areas. Prefer smaller airports but sadly not much available at times you want so stuck with the major termini.",3
1406,Watch out for dents in passenger and driver doors (bad parking from others)Need more cameras to identify culprits,4
1407,"Excellent apart from the people who park the cars, altered everything on my car and damaged a tyre not happy at all having a £180 bill for a new tyre, x4 as it’s a Quattro.",3
1408,"Car park is convenient. The only downside is the nuisance of taxis using the car park to pick up people and tout for fares, they block the exits and make it dangerous getting to your car with children. A car park is not for pick ups, it is for parking.",4
1409,"Easy to use and friendly. Very convenient too with everything being on-site at airport and not miles away. Bad experience of other services. Yes, this is more expensive, but you get what you pay for. Recommended.",5
1410,Smooth journey through Airport,4
1411,Check-in process is chaotic and slow (EasyJet). Oversize baggage drop off in Terminal 1 is a complete shambles (it took 40 minutes).,3
1412,Terminal 1 Manchester. We used meet and greet parking which is excellent and fast track security which again is a smooth process. Used to fly from Liverpool but the customer service was not as good as Manchester which is why we tend to fly from there as much as possible now.,5
1413,Good. Will use again.,4
1414,"Very easy to use service, staff are very nice and friendly",4
1415,Got through quick enough bad crash on m62 but got there in time only thing boarding card wouldn’t work and had to go back and get another then my bag was checked and me frisked not happened before like this won’t put us off will fly from Manchester again,4
1416,"Excellent service at M&G. Great value, easy to book and so close to the terminal.  Makes traveling very easy!",5
1417,Airport fine but car park needs attention to the surface,4
1418,Always get what I need/expect when travelling to and from here.,4
1419,Excellent stress free service. Staff polite and car was in safe hands so no need to worry on arrival back to England.,5
1420,05.00hrs thru security horrendousBeing forced to walk thru duty free horrendous,4
1421,"Easy to find, no fuss dtopping key off and simple automated pick up system. Always use meet & greet!",5
1422,"The staff were very helpful and the system of leaving the car was streamlined and easy - even though there were so many cars all arriving at the same time.Arriving and departing at early hours - we needed stress free and that is the exact service we received.  ""Hassle Free""  Thank you to the team that made this possible.  And having to walk just a short distance to the entrance of the terminal 1 maked the service perfect.",5
1423,"old airport that is dirty and unfit for purpose as in international airport.Passport and baggage areas a joke. last time i arrived, no automated passport machines work and only one person on the desk with three flight arriving.Only airport i have been to in the world, where you have to wait around 30 minutes for you luggage to arrive.",1
1424,"Fast, efficient, friendly.",5
1425,Everything perfect and stress free.,5
1426,The Long Stay carp park was on the middle of improvement works going on at the airport. This led to some confusion on entry but overall it is easy to use,4
1427,"Very disappointed about the damage/scrapes to our carWhen i called nobody seemed interested to help, a week back now and nobody has contacted us",3
1428,"good airport, but don't use long stay t2 until the construction works are complete.",4
1429,Easy parking experience at T3 with one minute walk to departures. Always free spaces on the top floor.,5
1430,With a couple of tweaks the M & G service could be excellent.,4
1431,"T3 Security is utter chaos. If you do your best to separate your liquids, electrical kit etc. etc. and split your luggage across say 3 trays - then if one tray gets pulled for further searches you are still delayed by approx. 30mins to 1 hour, regardless of the other 2 trays going through.From experience, chance of one tray getting pulled out of the 3 is 75%So, don't bother trying to separate your luggage, sling it all in together - afterall, you'll probably get pulled anyway. Just make sure you've a book to read while you're waiting the 60 mins or so for all the trays to come through.",1
1432,Good airport experience. Excellent affordable parking and terminals easy to navigate. Catering not so good especially by European standards.,4
1433,No real problems apart from passport control and security checks were slow due to the number of people.,4
1434,Brilliant.  Always use them when flying from Manchester.Never had a bad experience.,5
1435,Probably the most convenient way to start a journey and not so p-rohitively expensive as one might assume,4
1436,really good car park. we have used it a few times and we walk to the terminal. no problems at all,5
1437,There is a new system in place that requires tweaking.Our car was not parked in the area specified on the ticket.  We had to return to the office to find out where the car was.  We were informed that the tickets are never correct.We had just washed our car prior to parking but returned to find it filthy so this was also a disappointment.,2
1438,"Pleasant airport, though they do need more security through baggage area as was a substantial wait even though didn't seem to be a busy period.",4
1439,Due to building work at the airport I found it very difficult to find and use the car park.,3
1440,"Pleasant experience at Manchester Airport, from parking the car with Meet & Greet to the BA Lounge, however the same cannot be said for the Security staff, too  much talking amongst themselves and not concentrating on the job in hand or the passengers, more supervision is needed",4
1441,Easy to use and at a good price .. secure and safe .. does exactly what you need it to do .. I have used this service many times and never look elsewhere for airport parking,5
1442,Parked at Meet and Greet Terminal 2. Car had been left in a taxi rank. Disgraceful.,1
1443,I do not recommend anyone using the Meet and Greet service as they do not look after your carI usually use the multi storey car park and never had any problems I have just had a new car so I thought I would use the Meet and Greet service thinking my car would be looked afterThey need to replace their drivers as my front off side wheel was Kerbed very badly i contacted them and sent photo of the damage it has been nearly a week and I am still waiting for them to call be back if you value your car DO Not USE THIS Service,1
1444,Friendly staff. Efficient and professional,5
1445,It's getting better with all the work that's being carried out. Parking is too expensive but very convenient.,4
1446,Good parking avaliable with short and easy access to terminals,4
1447,"Manchester airport is OK.There is nothing wrong with this airport, it is clean and not too big - although I imagine if you have a transfer you could be doing a lot of walking.",4
1448,Very easy - just what you need after a long flight - a quick and easy transition to your car and home!,5
1449,Easy . No problems.  Will use again.,4
1450,"Excellent - good value for money, very handy",5
1451,Do not use jetparks awful from start to finish,1
1452,First time flying from Manchester and can’t wait for the next time.,5
1453,Well above my expections everything went like clockwork,5
1454,Nice and easy just what you want after a long journey,5
1455,Car parking at the Meet and Greet car parking reduces the hassle of getting into Departures and collecting your car on return is very straightforward. Wish the time it takes to get through security could be reduced.,4
1456,Friendly staff and all went to plan. Dropped car off easily and found it in same condition on return.,4
1457,Easy to book easy to find much improved since the renovations last year. Very quick and helpful would always recommend.,5
1458,"Great experience. Straight in and out. Car had been well looked after (as you would expect!) Very short cross over the road to check in, even better quick cross back over at 2am to go home. The service was top notch and I shall definitely use them again.",5
1459,Excellent service from online booking to transfers. Won’t use anyone else,5
1460,"Manchester airport is a cash cow for the owners, drop off charges, pick up charges, appalling food concessions which are very very expensive. I would use another airport if I had a choice of one close enough, but I have not.",2

1469,Can't wait until the improvements are complete. Hectic check in and car parking suffering from temporary lay out.,3
1470,"Reorganisation of roads outside the terminas confusing. Check in desks fine when working, but NOT good waiting for them to open as they give limited indication of which queue to wait in. Going through security ALWAYS has a long queue, necessary but SO LONG standing and shuffling forwards and the heat from so many bodies swelter.",4
1471,"Road works make approach to airport difficult, security checks have inadequate space to handle volumes of customers, the seating at the gates is poor and makes the departure experience uncomfortable. Passport control is slow and the staff are hostile. Other European airports offer a much better experience",2
1472,"Manchester Airport Meet & Greet are great, service is always efficient and timely, however, they seem to becoming greedy. The pricing is astronomical for one night/2 days in comparison to a week away!",4
1473,"Airport ok, but T2 long stay park park was disappointing, partly due to construction work, but better signs required as the work will take some time.",3
1474,One of my preferred airports when travelling although security can be a little chaotic at busy times.,4
1475,brilliant experience. Highly recommend,5
1476,"Shame about all the potholes where you have to drag your cases through, if it's raining then good luck.If you are parked in Ringway then only catch the Ringway bus or you will get a trip around the other car parks and end up back at the start.",3
1477,"Great From start to finish, not one problem",5
1478,"Check in and security needs improving massively! Takes too long! Should be as fast as other airports such as Spanish ones and all others abroad! They don’t mess about, que’s go down quickly unlike our English airports, other than that everything else is good and great car parking!",4
1479,Convenient and good value if you book in advance,4
1480,"Official Meet and Greet (make sure airport website) is a great service, very simple and car is safe throughout your stay, only ever 1-2 miles on the car where they transfer to a holding car park. Will use every time i travel, the only reason i would ever look elsewhere is when the cost gets too much as price increasing in my opinion alot.",5
1481,to much uncontrolled road works prior to journey this is another stress not needed early in the morning before a flight,3
1482,"Easy to book and use, nice hassle free trip",5
1483,A generally good airport badly let down by systems and people running the car park facility,2
1484,"Great Idea, I just didn't like how dirty / dusty my car was when I arrived back. would use again though",4
1485,"Manchester airport is like every other UK airport, it has it's pro's and con's.",4

1492,"Never found airport parking so easy, will reccomend",5
1493,"We usually prepay to use Manchester Airport short stay carparks when we fly from Manchester Airport but on this occasion we were only offered the choice of Meet and Greet for Terminal 1. Our past experience has shown that the Meet and Greet location is inside the short stay carpark which, although not our first choice, meant that we would deposit and retrieve our car under cover which is preferable given that it MIGHT be raining in the North of England. However, as we followed the obtuse signage through the airport to get to Meet and Greet for Terminal 1, past construction areas and weaving around in what looked like no-man's land, we discovered we were in an open air area being directed by an carpark attendant to put our car in a long queue of cars. The carpark attendant was nice enough but he was most concerned about the position of our vehicle in the queue, getting our car as far up along side and behind the cars already parked, notwithstanding the fact that my slim husband had to exit the passenger side of the car and that we had to be able to open the boot hatch to get 4 big bags out. And, then there was the fact that my husband had to go collect a trolley before we could depart the staging area which added another level of stupidity to this whole experience as the luggage trolleys were all located about 100 meters away from where our car was located.Lucky for us it wasn't raining when we arrived at 4:30 in the morning because this whole procedure, with us exposed to the elements, getting the bags out, getting them in the trolley and jigging the car to the carpark attendant's satisfaction took about 10 minutes during which we and our bags could have been wet through. And here's a tip: Take a pound coin with you because there's a charge for the trolley and you could be even wetter if you had to go BACK to your car for the coinage, like my husband had to do since he presumed that for the cost of the parking (expensive) that they'd throw in a trolley. In the end, bags collected, and inside the terminal we came away wondering how could they think that it was an idea to have the entire ""luxury"" experience of meet and greet be open air? It's just plain dumb and the logistics not well thought through. Upon our return, the experience was none better. The obtuse signage from inside terminal 1 arrivals is hard to find but becomes non-existent when you depart the actual airport terminal and start wandering around outside. There is signage on the lifts located on the left but the arrivals level is the correct level for Meet and Greet so if you get in, you are going up to departures and away from Meet and Greet.  It is only when you are 25 meters outside the terminal and up a set of stairs that you see a sign to Meet and Greet. My husband and I both have advanced degrees but it was only through a bit of guess work that we found our way to the pick-up point to collect our keys and find our car in a secondary car park adjacent to the airport. Again, weather was on our side and it wasn't raining. If it had been, we would have had a second opportunity to be wet through before getting our luggage and ourselves into the car and on our way home. I have filled out an official survey with the Manchester Airport authority articulating our experience but I would suggest that you're no better off with the Meet and Greet than you would be in the long stay carpark and catching the bus. At least there no one drives your car and you know that there's a chance that you might get wet and make provision for that in advance. In future, we will either pre-pay for short stay OR if that is not an option we will stay at the Hilton across the road and pay to keep our car there because this experience was unacceptable.",1
1494,"First time ever used park and fly at any airport, this site has open pedestrian access with no physical deterrent for entering the car park. I noted that the exit barrier was permanently raised and the cctv camera out of use/ broken. The arriving bus and departing vehicles did not have to stop to entre/exit. Located adjacent to the terminal construction site, our vehicle was covered in construction dust on return.  The signage and road layouts were confusing and dead ends and out of use bus stops were not clearly marked. If this was known prior to purchase I would not have parked our new vehicle here. I was under the impression that the site was fenced off with security control for entry and exit.",1
1495,"Better signage required, especially whilst the road works are ongoing",2
1496,"Too may queues in an otherwise well run airport. Then they want to sell Fast Track past the queues for more money. This suggests they are not interested in reducing the queues but generating income. If all the people in the queues were in departures spending money, how much more income to the shops?",3
1497,Very convenient. Bit expensive though!,5
1498,"Meet and Greet service is an excellent service, excellent customer experience, convenient and value for money.",5
1499,"Manchester airport is the best we've flown from. It's easy, efficient, great facilities and well kept",5
1500,Parking and check in all great. Airport departure terminal after security looking a bit tired and dated now. That includes the couple of restaurants. Really needs a make over.,5
1501,"Travelled with two children with severe life threatening Allergic reaction, I had travel authorisation marked '' This Child is at Risk of Life-Threatening Allergic Reaction''ANAPHYLAXIS and should be allowed to carry medication on hand bag not on luggage hold, I presented every medical papers but officer did not look and took everything and binned,after a long argument he called other 2 officers who read the papers and ordered all prescribed medication to be tested and allowed but not water and fortified  juice,although the juice is on prescription and consultant letters .The trouble officer took the items and told us we will get them after testing ,but none returned to us apart from Jext,I complained and below is just the lines of what the customer service manager replied ''Thank you for your recent feedback regarding your experience at Manchester Airport. Having now heard back from my security colleagues, I am informed that. generally speaking, no medication should be taken off any customers whilst processing through security. Any liquids that exceed 100ml are not permitted through to the critical part (airside) of the airport unless the contained has a clear prescription. This includes any water that exceeds 100ml will not be allowed through. Water and fruit juice would not be classed as prescribed medication but recommended to be mixed with the prescribed powder. Therefore, I take the view that the security officer acted correctly by disclaiming these items.I am taking legal advice as they have destroyed the antihistamine which we had to buy another one in Italy for 10 euros and very small tube .Before I was promised they would look CCTV after they have watched they knew it was shambolic act so I received no reply for few weeks until I sent them another email to ask what is going on with the cctv? so that was the reply I got.I am taking legal advice",1
1502,"Security in T1 was a joke! No organisation, staff didn’t know what was going on",3
1503,Manchester Airport parking is very good and I would recommend it to my friends and family to use.,5
1504,"I decided to leave my car in terminal 2 meet and greet for three weeks whilst I was away. I was anxious about leaving my car and my keys, when I arrived at the airport my car was scanned to show the condition, of my car when I arrived. When I returned my car was in the same condition as when I left it. Picking up my keys couldn't have been easier. I will definately be using this service again and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for parking.",5
1505,Bus service exceptional and we'll worth the money,5
1506,We always try to arrive early from Sheffield to Manchester airport in case of heavy congestion. Parking in the multi carpark was fine. Arriving back to our car took a little longer than expected but all went well.,4
1507,Easy to book find and use. Good value,5
1508,As far as airports go. Safe and easy and pleasurable,4
1509,"Always use greet and meet, to start our trip off well.",5
1510,Simple and easy process. Need to use your brain a bit when leaving the car park but just easy enough to make traveling simple,4
1511,"I collected the car after a 4 day trip and it was covered in dust, almost as though somebody had been joyriding down a dry dirt track! My seat was adjusted (which I can understand) but nearly everything inside the car had been adjusted, my steering wheel had been moved, my mirrors were facing the floor, aircon and blower settings were all over the place, my dashboard computer was left deep in the menus (someone had been goin through all the menus). My radio had been pretuned, and the volume was left really high! I don’t know where they leave the cars whilst you are away, or who drives them, but I can bet if I saw them I would not be happy with that person driving my car.",1
1512,"Re modelling car park so lots of cones, direction signs which were confusing. Overall efficient service, once in car park.",4
1513,"Excellent, would recommendp",5
1514,"great service, just wish they had washed my car as per my booking, and it would have been 5 stars",4
1515,Would not call Manchester a nice experience,1
1516,Ideal car park for location...prefer to meet and greet as it is only a very short distance away...why pay the extra?!?,4
1517,Very good. No problems.,5
1518,Excellent airport which is getting bigger and better,5
1519,"Very convenient, just across from the terminal.  Staff were very helpful when it appeared that we might need to remove our car due to our flight being cancelled.  When informed of our situation, the staff left our car outside their office until we could inform them of our plans.  They did this with no fuss whatsoever, showing complete understanding of our predicament - very reassuring! Thank you!",5
1520,Best airport in the country! I love Manchester!,5
1521,Meet and great is so simple and easy to use takes the stress out of start of the holiday.,5
1522,excellent car parking in terminal two will use again fast and convenient,5
1523,Great service and a lot more cost effective. Will use again.,5
1524,"A very useful and convenient facility, a bit pricey but actually reasonable value.",5
1525,"Sadly, Terminal 1 is a mess.  Entrance area is cluttered and crowded, confusing and poorly signed.  Security (Fast Track) machine was broken, so had to endure disorganised and over-zealous manual checks - certainly not fast.  Zig-zag through merchandising area takes up far too much of the terminal space.  Eating areas noisy, crowded and not very clean - seemed to be inadequately staffed.  At gate, had to go down stairs and back up stairs on the other side of the pier to get to the aircraft.  All very makeshift and over-stretched.",3
1526,some where to  safely park your car,4
1527,"Your car parks are easy and great to use we've never had a problem we've used them a few times, we will be using meet and greet later on this year for a different experience",5
1528,"Overpriced poor value , feels like you are been Mugged",3
1529,Excellent Service at Manchester Parking - totally destroyed by the experience of Security and Immigration,5
1530,the parking area is very run down compare to the price they charge .  i am sure that can be spent towards improving and decorating the parking bays etc. it is a convenient way of parking only 2 mins walk . meet and greet service is worth considering .,4
1531,Best thing I ever found so much easier than waiting around for taxis,5
1532,"Unfortunately Manchester Airport is continuing to decline and is frankly an embarrassment when it should be the jewel in the North West welcoming visitors to our region.Accessing the departure's area is simply too difficult now, especially at T3 with a new traffic route in place - maybe the plan is to add additional charges to have an easier access route which seems to be the airport's plan in other areas with multiple attempts to prise more cash from passengers?Arrivals passengers at T3 face an ever increasing queue at immigration and the airport's only response seems to be additional Tensabarriers, how about some additional passport scanners / access points - or just stop bringing so many flights into T3 at the same time?Baggage arrival is a lottery and the carousel areas are a mess (in all terminals) - welcome to Manchester? I don't think so.All in all, as a frequent flyer the worst part of my journey is in Manchester and that is not how it should be.",3
1533,"The bag checking system unbelievably bad.They have seperated the staff who scan bags and look at the scans from the staff next to th3 conveyor belts the bags move through, there is no communication between both sets of staff so huge huge queues of rejected bags are accumulating. The staff actually checking the bags therefore take a very long time to check the bag. We nearly missed our flight due to this insane new system (huge queue of v confused travellers-we waited about half hour and had to pull a staff member aside as our bag was put on the reject queue a SECOND time after the first reject check...) of bag checks in T3. Go back to bag checking scanner staff sat next to the conveyors !!!",1
1534,Excellent company. Quick and effickent service every time,5
1535,"Very poorBus flew past our stop and did not bother to stop to pick us up, even tho bus was almost empty.When the same driver did return back after 20 minutes, he dropped us all off at the far end of the car park and made us walk the ito the other end saying he did not drop off at the waiting station we were originally picked up from. I felt sorry for the OAPs who were struggling with their luggage as the roads were uneven and helped them as best as they could, whilst the bus drover sat and watched.Won’t use this service again",1
1536,Excellent service from start to finish - will be using again shortly and have no hesitation in recommending them,5

1538,"Overall brilliant service unless the driver is finishing his shift, not nice being on a racing bus i think he was late for his lift home.",5
1539,Very efficient service - always feel as if I have booked the car in for a holiday of its own!!,4
1540,I got a bit confused driving into airport but meet and greet were lovely and the process was easy. Staff were very helpful and friendly.,4
1541,No need to struggle through congested London when I can choose to travel via my home city and contribute to my home economy. Keep it in the Northern Power House - fly Manchester.,5
1542,Have used meet and greet many times and have never had any cause for complaint alway very efficient.,5
1543,"racist/sexist/aggressive security staff.""that's a pretty name"" to my wife whilst slavering uuuugh",2

1551,"Worst car park ever! Impossible to find, poor signage!Surface poor, ended up with a flat tyreScratched upon my returnCouldnt get out and had to contact help desk",1
1552,Fair price for long stay and felt secure being an airport owned car park. Bus service was ok and overall worth using,4
1553,Convenient and prefer to use own car instead of taxis/public transport.  Reasonable value as I had a 20% off voucher emailed,4
1554,The meet and greet experience was great no problem at all I had been recommended by a friend and she said that the cars were kept in the car park I wasn’t too sure my car had mud on the tyres and the doors Not sure wether they are parked off site,5
1555,Makes flying a little less painful when the airport is easy to use,5
1556,Stress free parking. Relax on holiday.,5
1557,very happy with the overall service provided,4
1558,Car park states 10 min not 35 to 40 min got fed up of waiting so rang and asked is there a bus strike bus arrived 5 min later with a bus driver not very happy,2
1559,"Everything went well,especially I have to appreciate the bus driver on our arrival time who helped us to put luggage in the bus. I was struggling with two kids but the driver helped us and he was so friendly. Very good experience.",5
1560,good car parking with easy access to terminal one,5
1561,Our latest holiday we travelled from Manchester airport. Our experience was amazing. From the minute we entered the airport we went straight through with cases no queues  straight through customs then into the v room till our flight.👍,5
1562,Feel that I'm in good hands!! Thanks,5
1563,Just about as good as an airport gets with lots of attentive and caring staff.,5
1564,MAG seem to prioritize profit over customer satisfaction. Everywhere is crowded and getting to and from your aircraft is an unpleasant experience.,2
1565,Car parking is expensive and now pick up/drop off also costs a fortune!,3

1568,Meet and greet fantastic. Easy access to departure.Overall great service and clear directions given.,5
1569,"No hassle on pick-up or drop-off, very reasonably priced",5
1570,Parking & Fast Track do not offer any great value.,2
1571,Work ongoing to upgrade the airport infrastructure and facilities and it needs it.Manchester is one of my least favourite airports to fly from and that investment needs to be ongoing and quality.,3
1572,"be sure to amend car parking details prior to departure, as the website will not allow you to do so once ya car is parked. you will be subject to an overpriced surcharge if you don't. the potcode for the car park is incorrect and needs to be updated, unless you know exactly where the car park is. other than that, everything was fine",4
1573,Excellent service from Parking your car to boarding the plane.  5 stars for Manchester,5
1574,Hassle-free with number plate recognition entry & exit & good value,5
1575,From parking to flying out no problems. Always a pleasure to use Manchester Airport,5
1576,The car parking was fine and as usual an extremely perfect professional service.,5
1577,"Compared to other airports (especially against ones abroad)I find Manchester a great one to travel from, efficient and helpful always.",5
1578,"Dreadful. A building site. poor signs, disorganised.AVOID",2
1579,Dated facilities with a baggage handling service that remains the slowest of any airport I have visited in over 30 years of travel. Very disappointed to book the T2 car parking services- only to lose my money when trying to cancel on the day due to a change in circumstances.,2
1580,"The car park is secure, and the staff I met on return were good. However, my departure journey was horrific. Knowing that the car park was some distance from the terminals I left plenty of time, or so I thought. After arriving at the car park and struggling to find a space, it took almost an hour to get on a bus. Do not trust the advertised frequency of buses. The Friday two buses were full because of how infrequent they are. None of the drivers which were full have us info of how long we might have to wait. Other passengers waiting missed their flight because of this. Shocking experience.",1
1581,Jet park Ringway experience very goodAirport experience as good as they get too.,4
1582,Overall I was impressed with the way the airport was still run efficiency with all of the building work taking place. Still my preferred long haul airport over Birmingham and Luton.,4
1583,Not bad as they go. Departure seating (T3) not very comfortable,4
1584,"The airport as improved greatly over the last year, Jet Park open car park still need to improve",4
1585,"Bad planning, horrendous roadworks, poor signposting, and ghastly conditions during the never-ending terminal 2 rebuild coupled with a shortage of carpark capacity and exorbitant parking charges. And the  experience is of rough wasteground for parking with little evidence of cameras or proper security controls. Potholes everywhere.The airport itself boasts an awful huge maze-like duty free, ghastly long walks (up to half a mile) to/from departure gates with broken down or non-existent travelators and limited bar/restaurant facilities which shutdown really early and charge silly prices.",2
1586,Easy to find and good bus service to and from terminal,5
1587,The airport is fine just don’t park at Jetpark,1
1588,Easy to book and use but allocated space would be better.,5
1589,"Great one Airport, managing and maintaining well, proud to use it again and again.",5
1590,"An extremely busy airport, often overcrowded at peak times. Security worse than most with officious staff who seem to delight in making things as difficult as possible. Much prefer Leeds or Liverpool.",2
1591,Very well ran airport with great transport links and onsite hotels.,5
1592,Car parking is convenient. Choice of shops could be better but in general is well managed.,4
1593,It is makes the things easier. Descent treatment at all.,4
1594,As good as you can get for an airport home or abroad,5
1595,Good parking but some drivers attitudes could be improved,4
1596,"Great parking facility, easy to find, get to get the shuttle bus to and from. Great service",5
1597,Vrey good to use and i got a good price. I would use all the time now,5

1599,"Super system, easy to use, friendly staff, makes the journey just that bit better!",5
1600,Paid for valet it wasn’t done and they charged me for it,1
1601,"Excellent service, clean, efficient and friendly",5
1602,"I use M&G every time I fly. Great service, so handy to have your car there and ready at the airport terminal.",5
1603,Poor facilities and parking and now a drop off charge. This has turned into a slightly unpleasant airport to fly from. Will use alternatives in future,2
1604,Overall good experience,4
1605,Easiest secure parking at Manchester Airport,5
1606,Excellent M&G experience. I will be using the service all the time from now on. Well worth the money.,5
1607,"Great location, but facilities are in need of modernisation",3
1608,Getting to jet parks 2 was a night mare. We could not find it signposted anywhere and all the enterances were blocked with zero diversion signs. Get there is plenty of time in preparation of a wild goose chase,5
1609,"Used Meet & Greet T1, excellent service and friendly staff, a credit to Manchester Airport, will definitely be using them again",5
1610,better then average experience departing manchester as I usually find the security checking process very slow.  on this ocassion though it was very efficient.  Car park process easy and convenient.  Will use manchester again in the future.,4
1611,"Apart from constantly having to negotiate different roadwork, nice experience.",4
1612,Friendly staff journey with confidence and no problems finding meet and greet would use again thank you,5
1613,Overall very convenient and reasonably priced,4
1614,"I have only ever had reason to use terminal 3. Meet n Greet is great, especially for a woman travelling on her own. The proximity of drop off to departures is excellent. Have tried lounges, 1903 and escape, only allowed 2 hours in former and from a personal point of view didn't think it was worth the extra money. The offering in duty free is limited, but it is a smaller terminal. However, it is a busy terminal and sometimes it means lack of seating in the dining areas. The large refreshment area in the middle can become a little like a cattle market. Definitely room for improvement.",4
1615,Wonderful experience. Absolutely loved the ease and comfort.,5
1616,Always comfortable to leave my car knowing it will be safe,5
1617,Always use Meet & Greet and have never been disappointed!  Great service,5

1620,"Old fashioned, rather cramped.",3
1621,Very happy with my experience would recomend it easy ans quick to use.,5
1622,Easy good and convenient service. Worth the money,5
1623,I have always been happy with my airport experience.,5
1624,Nice and Easy,5
1625,Requires clear direction to meet and greet,4
1626,Despite the building work meet & greet still quality parking experience,4
1627,Very efficient and hassel free. Even moved our car to the Terminal we were landing at. Very impressed!,5
1628,Makes the holiday easier with the travelling and parking much improved and standards high - thank you,5
1629,GOOD BUT EXPENSIVE,3
1630,Very busy airport. Found our car parking (Meet & Greet) quickly but no staff available to tell me where to park. Leaving the airport (after midnight) quite confusing because of temporary road layout. (Also M60 and M62 badly affected by overnight road works.) Far too much perfume on sale.,3
1631,Ease of use and value for the money is great. Double check your journey before leaving home,5
1632,"Great all round experience, have used before and will be using again shortly, it just all works well",5
1633,Good. Easy to park and get to.,4
1634,"The only problem I have with the airport is the unhappiness the the security have on there face, get another job if you come to work every day like that, it’s bad for your health",4
1635,easy parking and quick access to terminal 2 and good quick pick up of car from parking area,5
1636,"The first experience was the Multi story which was difficult to navigate with inaccurate signs which were supposed to direct you to spaces not working apparently.  The system for navigating the car park was alos difficult with different levels having different access and entry points on a one way system.  Check in was fine and the staff were helpful.security was slow.Jet2 changed the gate three times which meant crossing the whole terminal each time.  some of the gates require you to go under the main floor via two sets of steps which again seems unnecessary and poorly designed.   There were two very drunk and rowdy stag do's on our flight which didn't help the overall experience.Passport control was fine on the return tripfinding and then exiting the car park was again annoying and not really intuitive or well though out.exiting the airport itself was good, well signposted and straight onto the motorway.",3
1637,Meet and greet at T2 was incredible for  level of service and friendliness of the staff. As you would expect the location is a couple of minutes walk from the terminal. Overall great value for money.,5
1638,Manchester Airport 'meet & greet' experience was excellent. Fast and efficient. No waiting or long walk both on arrival and departure.,5
1639,"Easy, quick and stress free!",5
1640,"Good airport, exspensive at times , I wish the planes would take off on time, but they never do.",5
1641,"5 stars: Excellent – no reservations, I would recommend this company to anyone.",5
1642,"It's a car park, you arrive, park your car, get bus to terminal then do reverse on way back. Easy enough and decent price.",3
1643,More work needed to find car park spaces!!! still very hard work...,2
1644,Reliable service. Does what it says on the tin,5
1645,Would recommend to anyone looking for simple and convenient car parking experience with no hassle.,5
1646,Parking was easy. 1st time I have been told to book for use of the airport lounge which was full on my arrival.,3
1647,Expensive but close to facilities,4
1648,Thank you very much,5
1649,Easy to use. No hassle,5
1650,"I have always found the park and ride very easy to use.Just remember which bus stop you got on for your return journey. The first time we used this service a few years ago we didn't, but the bus driver was very helpful and we did find where we parked.",5
1651,"We seemed to have picked a quieter time for our flight so the airport wasn't that busy. It made our visit quite pleasant. Only down side was the gate waiting area, cramped and poor seating.",4
1652,This is only for the meet and greet at terminal 1,1
1653,Lots of shops/ things to do before you fly- need better signage of motorways/roads ie which exit to use for Liverpool,4
1654,"First class airport, great parking if a little pricey!",5
1655,"My Husband and I found using the car park an easy experience, On our part next time we park we need to remember what floor we are on. The whole Airport experience went smoothly with friendly helpful  staff.",5
1656,"I would prefer to use the parking as it is more convenient for me, but it is getting too expensive now, they keep putting prices up especially in summer and it is now cheaper for me to get a taxi. I have a trip booked for June for 10 days and it is far cheaper in a taxi than to use the car park then the airport winge that there are too many cars so they are going to start charging to pick up and drop off. Come on Manchester,it is not brain surgery how to ease the congestion",3
1657,"Our flight was scheduled to leave Manchester Airport at 7.20am and we arrived at 5.15am- a good two hours before our fflight. That should have been enough to ensure a stress free experience but it wasn’t. The problem was SECURITY- because there were too many flights and not enough personnel to cope with the number of passengers. The queues snaked around the security area and it took an hour to reach the point where the checks / scans were done. Several staff were dilatory and seemed in a daze- they didn’t seem to care that people had flights to catch. We finally arrived at the departure gate with two minutes to spare before it opened at 6.50am.Manchester Airport itself would have lost out by their poor organisation since there was no time for anyone to do any shopping in the numerous shops in the departure zone or even buy a cup of coffee. My advice to travellers is to avoid Manchester Airport if there is any alternative since to go there is to invite stress. I personally intend to boycott it in any future travel plans. Robin Hood Airport at Doncaster, Humberside Airport and East Midlands Airport are much better choices. By comparison Munich Airport was much better organised- especially Security. Perhaps Manchester Airport should organise a training day for its staff at Munich Airport so that they can see how it should be done.",1
1658,I accidentally booked two weeks instead of one. Picked the car up after one week but have been refused a refund for the week we didn’t use even though the lady at the front desk told us we would be refunded. Fly nearly every month from Manchester and use the parking Facility.... will not be again in the future due to this experience.,1
1659,"Airport seems to be continually upgrading, so some changes can come as a bit of a shock. The changes are obviously for the better.",4
1660,"Had a great experience with the Meet & Greet car parking.  So easy to book online then we just turned up at the airport, left our car in the parking area, handed over our keys and walked into the airport. Took 5 minutes in total. On the way back, we just scanned our parking ticket and a little locker popped open with our car keys and location of car. Took all of 2 minutes to walk to the car.  Why can't everything in life be so easy. Thank you M&G.",5
1661,I would use a different service. I am a wheelchair user and there was no bus from Short Stay 3 to the terminal,3
1662,Not the best meet and great to find but still a good service,4
1663,"Meet and greet parking at Manchester Airport is one of the best parking arrangements at any UK airport, accurate and hassle free.",5
1664,When I returned to my car I couldn't get in through the drivers side front door. The car parked next to me was literally only inches from my car. I had to enter through the passenger side door and then climb over the seats to get to the drivers seat.,3
1665,Manchester is our preferred airport for our travels. Once roadworks and redevelopment is completed then no quibbles from us,4
1666,its ok new roads lay out is confusing to get to T3,3
1667,Dirty when it's raining and not enough parking spaces until you find a little corner to leave your car in. Not  a stress free start to a holiday,3
1668,Not a bad experience,3
1669,No hold ups even with major works to site . overall good experience.,5
1670,I have been to Manchester airport many times and have used the parking facilities as well and find the whole experience just great no problems from me,5
1671,"We travelled in April flying to Malta to join our cruise ship.We had an extremely early flight so used ""meet & greet"" parking, which was excellent.then the time spent in the airport until our flight at 6.am was all very positive.There were restaurants open from four a.m & plenty of shops open too.Manchester is a very good Airport, clean and efficient, with great parking and friendly helpful staff on hand if needed.",5
1672,Good airport and parking.Temporary signage from access roads could be better.Good experience as long as the M56 is flowing.,4
1673,Airport undergoing major work led to reduced qualiry of service,3
1674,"First time using the multi-story in T3, the roadworks were a little awkward as it quite easy to go wrong. Parking was easy, there were plenty of spaces available, easy access to the terminal. Early morning flight so it was not to busy through the security area. Plenty of staff on to cope with the volumes, the staff were very pleasant.",4
1675,"Easy to use, good discounts if booked ahead of time.",4
1676,"Meet and greet and outbound experience great, baggage took forever to come through on return, given it was 05:00 suspect they didn't have enough staff on.",4
1677,"I came, I parked, I flew, I returned, I uplifted my car, I leftno probs/issues or excitements",3
1678,"A pleasant ,efficient and well organised Airport!",5
1679,"Easy to find and park, all under one roof and within walking distance. Why go anywhere else?",4
1680,"Excellent car park immediately adjacent to Terminal One.  You can park your car and then walk straight through to departures. Easy to book online and works on ANPR so no ticket. Mark B.  , Derby",5
1681,Excellent staff very friendly and helpful everywhere clean and tidy,5
1682,"Easy to find, plenty of spaces and excellent bus service",5
1683,Conveniently located airport with good public transport links.,4
1684,"The new ""non FASTTRAK"" security arrangements in T1 are a disgrace! We were herded into a shabby disgusting basement like cattle. An obvious ploy to make customers pay the additional amount for fast track. Along with the new no drop off arrangements the experience of Manchester Airport is no longer a good one! You have turned into a money generating machine and your poor customers into ""cash cows""! Usual signs of rip-off Britain!",4
1685,"perfect for what we need, good service, good price",5
1686,"Excellent service, we chose M&G it was so easy,a short walk to the terminal and no waiting around for buses. I would definitely recommend when flying from Manchester. Will be using again in December",5
1687,"good airport, easy to get to good parking.",5
1688,"For a large airport, beats London airports hands down for the friendliness of the staff.",5
1689,"Manchester airport parking is perfect (I parked in T3 short stay and walked to T1 departures)  , easy to get to easy to park your car and a perfect short walk to the terminal that’s signposted ! Will be using it every time !",5
1690,"We arrived when it was very busy. Finding the terminal 1 meet and greet Parking was complicated by road works and poor signage, but the service was excellent.Check-in was well run and not too trying.Security was a shambles. They clearly have trouble dealing with large numbers of people and were constantly being accosted by customers who couldn't understand the complicated screening process. Our hand baggage, Coats, and electronics ended up in three different places.Departure area was extremely crowded, but we eventually found somewhere to sit, and have breakfast.Arrival process was seamless, and we only had to wait 15 minutes for our luggage (including Golf Bags) to arrive.",4
1691,"No problem parking, number plate recognition worked fine, bus came within minutes. Bus stops clearly marked, make sure you write the number of your car park area before you leave on your holiday. Can get quite full at peak times.",5
1692,Everything about the airport was good. We flew Jet2 and arranged assistance at the airport through them and we were looked after both ways. Very good airport and service.,5
1693,"So handy for the terminal and very friendly staff at the cabin, so convenient and very reasonable",5
1694,Apart from works going on and signs not clear once inside it's good,4
1695,everything was great except passport control when returning massive queue,5
1696,Don’t bother booking pre-parking for short stay car park! You will never find it as there are NO signs for it ANYWHERE!,1
1697,Excellent service and easy to get from A to B.,5
1698,Easy and friendly and would deffo recommend,5
1699,We missed the flight Because of poor bus connection(40min waiting time) from jet3 car park. We arrive on the AirPort 38min to the flight departure and no one help us. Girls behind the Ryanair customer desk said We can leave our baggage somewhere on the AirPort as They dont have any baggage storage and We might find our baggage after holiday. In them terms and condtions saying They should offer the nearest flight for £100 But she was looking a flights on Skyscanner app on her own phone and Than she recommend as flight for £400 in next two days. Btw We bought one for next day Just for £80. Really unproffesional.,1
1700,Waiting time at passport control is way too longBaggage is very slow to arrive compared to other airports,3
1701,"Easy M&G parking experience, no problems",5
1702,Meet and Greet is greatAirport experience is very good,5
1703,"All round very good, parking, check in, departure and return.",5
1704,"Perfect.  No glitches, meet and great service was so easy , airport experience was great, no complaints with any aspects of our recent travels.",5
1705,Easy to use; excellent valet-clean service. Good value for money.,5
1706,A little overpriced considering how far away the car park is from the airport. Well lit and bus service fairly regular.,3
1707,"No problems at Manchester Airport, arrivals passport control could be quicker.",4
1708,"This is our prefered airport, being close to where we live and always a good experience from start to finish wherever we have travelled.",4
1709,Easy to find on internetEasy to bookRegular update information prior to flightWould definitely recommendWould use again without hesitation,5
1710,"Need more staff on immigration, a quicker route through from security to gates without having to twist and turn through shopping areas would be beneficial to those of us who have no desire to purchase anything.",3
1711,"I hate that we have to pay for a trolley - that’s just money grabbing with no desire to help customers - appalling. Compared to other airports around the world, Manchester looks tired and dirty with too much focus on making money (huge duty free for example) and never enough seats, or staff. Inadequate space for the number of people using the terminal (3 especially). The Meet and Greet car park has very friendly friendly and helpful staff, but there are often delays on entering and leaving.",2
1712,Very easy to find once at the airport and straight forward parking procedure right in front of departures. Returning was a slight problem but only because there was temporary offices in place to pick up car keys which meant any one with walking disabilities like myself had to drag their suitcase to the office and then back to their car. Once this is sorted it will be much easier.,4
1713,"First time that I have flown from this airport and it was a fairly painless experience. No delay time, speed through security, etc. All went well both on arrival and departure.",4
1714,T3 Multi-storey is really convenient ... great if you wish to get home quickly after a late evening flight,5
1715,"Manchester AirportTerminal 3 Meet and Greet , very efficient and easy to use .",4
1716,"Good airport we use it frequently, bar and food areas are usually very busy, so worth considering booking a lounge. Downside on your return the passport control machines are normally out of order and the queues quickly build up and waiting time for baggage can be a while.",5
1717,"Overcrowded, poor customer service. Ripoff car park prices.",1
1718,"Its ok to find and park and staff were freindly enough but when I picked my car up the seat and mirrors had been altered in such a way that it makes me wonder if the car had been used for more than just parking, in future I will check my mileage when leaving the car.",2
1719,"Always fly from here where possible. Great parking, spacious airport, good facilities.",5
1720,"Looking a little bit tired, but a lot of building work going on. Still a good functioning airport.",4
1721,"It looks like someone is really starting to think about us as clients.We definitely are your treasured clients and Manchester Airport has to remain the best it can be or we look for airports with less hassle. eg, Leeds, Robin Hood  Well done.  See you again soon. The sooner the better.",4
1722,Always difficult to find a space. Good location otherwise.,3
1723,"I am disabled and needed to sit down after the long walk though the shopping area but was told (very rudely) by one of staff from Uppercrust that I could only sit down if bought something, despite pointing out I was disabled. Very unfriendly",3
1724,"Upon collecting my car from Meet and Greet at Terminal 2 I noticed some minor marks/dents along the nearside of my vehicle which I immediately reported. A member of staff inspected my car, agreed they were present, took photo's, filled out a report and assured me I would receive an email claims proceedure form the following day. That was 5 days ago and despite my subsequent call to the car park booking centre 2 days ago and being assured once again I would get an immediate call back I have heard nothing. I have used Meet and Greet on previous occassions and it is easy and convienient to use but fingers crossed you have no issues as customer service is frustrating and poor.",2
1725,Great experience from car park to take off,5
1726,Fabulous easy way to park your car will definitely be using the service again and very soon,5
1727,"Parking at Manchester is so convenient we parked very close to the terminal. We have travelled from T1 T2 and T3, all easy access to the departure lounge from the  car park. For us the cost is similar to the cost if a taxii, but the experience and speed is so much better",5
1728,"T1, T2 or T3 car parks are always top class and my car has always been perfect upon return",5
1729,"One trip, Charged me twice to park my car",1
1730,"Easy parking and with great service at check in, best airport I've used in years.",5
1731,There is no help for disabled persons on the buses,4
1732,"Excellent Service, car was secure and right next T3 entrance.",5
1733,"Great car parking, very close and accessible to departures, 3 minutes walk to the door!Departures (once we got to the right floor) was fab, hardly any queues, the friendliest staff I’ve ever experienced at an airport, even the security were friendly as we went through the check point!Great job!",4
1734,Love using the car parking at the airport and the airport it self is very clean and most of the time hassle free,5
1735,Very helpful staff and good customer service,5
1736,"I have knee replacements and the staff at security check are always officious, uncaring and totally lacking in pleasantries or smiles. I have never experienced such an unpleasant experience at any other airports.",3
1737,Reasonable price and no problems with entry and exit. We booked the executive bit and there were spaces so no problems. You walk straight into departures (terminal three),5
1738,"Easy parking , great bus to airport terminal, return journey, fantastic, just write down your car park name, and bus number , and bus stop number . So easy.",5
1739,"Going through security is a very unpleasant, undignified and worrying experience. ""Will my wallet which I have had to put in the tray to be X -rayed still be there by the time I have been patted down?""",3
1740,"First time used the car parks at MA, would definitely do it again.",5
1741,small and friendly airport with a good meet and greet car parking service,5
1742,The car park was easy to find and access. No issues parking and the shuttle service was timely. No issues on return. Good value for money,5
1743,"Always easy to depart and arrive, clean. No problems with passport control, my only issues   are car was filthy on return due to work going on and the food and drinks are so overpriced, just makes it a bit naff when your just starting your holiday",5
1744,"Meet and Greet at Terminal 2 was quick, efficient, and offered good value for money. I would use this service again and recommend others do same.Our only issue was that a screw ended up in our tyre, which now has to be replaced.",4
1745,"Great if you don't use T1 Meet and Get stuffed, looking for your car in the pitch black crawling on your knees, good luck!",3
1746,"Very smooth efficient service, will be a more pleasant experience when work has been completed between carparks , terminal and surrounding area.",5
1747,Meet and Greet when it is priced sensibly is the only way to do it.Friendly and helpful staff which makes going to the airport a part of the holiday.,5
1748,A very easy way to park!No searching for parking spots- just drop your keys and go,5
1749,Fantastic experience everything was as hassle free as it could be. From booking car parking right though to security shopping lounges and then boarding. Coming back was a pleasure no lengthy hold ups everything flowed as it should do.,5
1750,Great all round service but bus stops need to be improved because if it's raining while your waiting for the bus to the terminal your going to get wet !,4
1751,Parked car in T1 meet and greet. Was a little unsure where entrance was but if you read the directions and follow them using Google earth's Street view it really helps.Staff were friendly and helpful. Exiting the airport was easy.,5
1752,"Fast, friendly and efficient service, would highly  recommend.",5
1753,"All I have to say is from when we got of the plane at 8pm from Lanzarote to finally get our bags of the conveyor belt at 9.30pm has got to be the longest time I've ever had to wait for our luggage, we are regular flyers out of different airports and Manchester is the worst out of all of them. We are now going to make a point by flying out of other airports even If it costs fractionally more, plus what a right mess they have made of terminal 2 where you get the buses for the Jet Parks",2
1754,Easy access to the terminal.didnt have to wait long for the bus to transfer us.,5
1755,"Departure is usually okay. Security can be over-busy, and needs more space and staffing. Arrival can be very unpleasant: poor scheduling of arrivals can create long queues for passport control, which would not occur if arrivals were arranged better. Manchester needs better management and investment. It looks and feels increasingly out of touch with developments in other countries. And it charges for baggage trolleys. Is the UK the only country which does this?",2
1756,"1st time we used the meet and greet service, i would highly recommend it. It was so easy and hassle free. with friendly staff to help",5
1757,Everything was as expected and easy to use.an excellent service.,4
1758,The arrivals passport control needs overhauling and get rid of the        automated system that clearly doesn't work..40 minutes wait in queues is not acceptable.,3
1759,Meet and greet good.  Passport control improving.  Security slow and some staff  polite but one rude.,3
1760,Great airport plenty to pass the time away staff knowledgable and efficient,5
1761,"Plenty of spaces, very friendly staff. Number plate recognition works really well.",4
1762,"First time i used this service but cannot fault it , reasonable price , parking right next to the terminal , easy to book online and full arrival instructions provided, would recommend to anybody .",5
1763,Everything was great with the exception of bus from jetpark1 to terminal 2 was running late. Upon arrival the passport queue was long but this was only a minor inconvenience.,4
1764,"OUR CAR WAS BROKEN INTO IN THE MANCHESTER AIRPORT OFFICIAL CAR PARK - JETPARKS RINGWAY.  ACCORDING TO THE POLICE AND THE STAFF THIS IS A REGULAR OCCURRENCE, WITH KIDS CLIMBING THE PERIMETER FENCE NIGHTLY. DEFINITLY DO NOT RECOMMEND PARKING THERE",1
1765,car park being updated so a labyrinth to enter but overall ok,3
1766,"Manchester is a very busy airport, security and passport control can be problems but apart from that it's a good place to fly from and to.",4
1767,"The airport is amazing and on the face of it runs like clockwork. The only let down is going through security. I fully understand and appreciate that it must be very frustrating having to constantly repeat yourself and still people leave items in their cases. However, the staff were short, curt and at times verged on being rude. Such a shame when everything else is excellent.",5
1768,"Excellent – no reservations, I would recommend this company to anyone.",5
1769,A little bit of the the 3rd world treatment that last for as long as the plane is delayed.,2
1770,"Really poor.Over £60 for a day in the multi-storey. No signage.Aggressive and abrupt in security Need to crash course on customer service, if you are travelling on business its horrible.",1
1771,"Good airport, just a lot of disruption on going as they are currently rebuilding the terminal.",4
1772,"Other than getting to the car park which was confusing, travelling from Manchester Airport is overall a very stress free experience in comparison to Heathrow.   Definitely fly from Manchester Airport again.",4
1773,"First time used meet and greet parking, would highly recommend",5
1774,"A perfectly normal airport, neither outstandingly good nor bad. There is hassle when you arrive if you spend too long over that farewell kiss and the cost for picking someone up is punitive. Building works on the roads make the approach confusing. Allow plenty of time to get there and find where you want to go and should be!",4
1775,"Meet and greet parking excellent. The baggage hall was a stressful, chaotic experience!",4
1776,Easy to find and entry and exit work fine but need to sort out the bus timings and the hard standing.,4
1777,Meet and Greet Terminal 1 very good no problems spot on,5
1778,"Great experience. Always easy, Airport parking is brilliant.",5
1779,"T3 short stay car park is not close to the terminal.  Car park pricing is extremely high.  I only use Manchester because of the flight connections, otherwise I would prefer to use Sheffield/Doncaster or East Midlands",1
1780,Jetparcs experience poorno clear signage from airport and roadworks caused extensive traffic delays as carpark is a good distance from airport. Buses to airport from carpark were erratic and mostly full both to and from airport.,1
1781,Overall a decent experience but expect some disruption whilst they exrend the airport,4
1782,no fuss just secure parking had no problems at all will always use jet parks.,5
1783,"On returning to the meet and greet (Terminal 1), I returned to find my car had been damaged. Scratched all along the left hand side and on the boot. My car is less than 4 months old. It was covered and sprayed in mud all along the let side looked like it had been raced through a puddle of mud. The dirt was so high it coved the left side windows and windscreen.  The alloys were non visable due to being covered in thick mud, the steering wheel had been adjusted and moved the radio stayand controls of my car had been changed and tampered with. It was clear that somebody had been driving my car probably for personal use and it has been damaged it!!!!!",1
1784,"Vehicle was damaged during stay and damage not visible due to a dark car park.  No interest in the issue as I had left the car park before spotting the damage.  Fair enough, but their staff should have reported the damage in the first place.  The car was in their care.",2
1785,Parked in the T2 MSP for 5 weeks but came back to a car covered in dust and plaster splashes! Otherwise the bays are small and large cars overhang. Otherwise the MSP can be very congested at peak times.Past experience of the long term is again small bays and a very poor ground surface with gravel and dust rather than smooth tarmac and they overfill the carparks so you can drive for ages looking for a space and when there is one its too small for your car!,2
1786,"spot on, Manchesters been my best experience of air travel by far. Never had any hassles with parking or the airport. the odd delay but always kept up to date with whats happening.",5
1787,Using the car park was pretty easy and made a day trip quicker without waiting for a taxi!,5
1788,Great overall experience had by all at Manchester airport would most definitely fly from here again,5
1789,"Safe and secure for my car with little hassle, getting to the airport and returning to collect my car was easy and fast.",5
1790,"Meet and greet car park is not worth the extra money, you basically park your car in the car park give your keys to an attendant and go in the airport. On return the temporary office isn't easy to find, then when you do find it another attendant hands you your keys and tells you where your car is in the car park! Isn't the whole point of meet and greet for them to bring your car to you??",2
1791,"Manchester Airport has excellent access by road, a good range of parking options , and excellent check in,departure and arrivals facilities.",5
1792,"Terminal 1 short term parking facilities very poor - need a complete refurb - grubby, tired and dirty. Parking spaces narrow and insufficient (20 minutes to find a space despite indicating that spaces available).",2
1793,Overall quite satisfied with car parks and bus transfer waiting times but under foot conditions in certain areas could be improved with better drainage. Footpaths between bus stops and terminal buildings needs improving also.,3
1794,Bus transfer from car parks not frequent or timely. Terminal itself is pleasant enough.,3
1795,Staff with a smile and ready to help and put you at ease.,5
1796,Meet and Greet at Terminal 3 is excellent.  I've used it many times now and wouldn't consider any other parking solution,5
1797,"i could not find entry straight away. Token given requested further payment, even though i had paid on line. Was sorted easily after 10 minute delay.May be it was me or i was unluckyWould give it another go.",4
1798,Generally good - some delays at security.,4
1799,"If you can fly from elsewhere do so as Manchester is overcrowded, understaffed and about as stressful as it gets when flying.",3
1800,Would have been an overall 5 stars but for the misleading signage to get access to Premier Blue Spaces.,4
1801,very good will be using again,5
1802,"Unsafe official car parking and long queues, LPL has become the much better option.",1
1803,Smooth departure but arrivals could be quicker,4
1804,Relatively easy to use. And really close to the terminals.,4
1805,"The whole experience was ok and we have no problems with the service, We will use the service again no doubt as it is much easier than parking outside the airport and being transferred by bus to the terminal.",5
1806,Great service and extremely convenient.  Will be using them again.,5
1807,Easy to bookEasy to access Easy to exit.  Simples,5
1808,"Meet & Greet Car Park is great but try contacting them by phone and I got voicemail after waiting ages. Several times. Getting into and out of the airport by road is, well, difficult, to say the least.",4
1809,"Manchester Airport is in desperate need of maintenance.  The car parks, waiting areas and facilities across the airport fall below standards at most other airports across Europe.",2
1810,"More signs require for direction to the car park, check-in desks and lifts in the car park. T3 Car park signs are non existant",4
1811,"Suberb apart from the bus driving past us in the pouring rain and when I stopped the driver he told us to get to the bus stop he waited about 30 seconds then drove off, the bus stop was about 200m away, so we had to wait 15 mins at 3am in the cold / rain waiting for the bus to call round again.",4
1812,Be careful do not parl your gar with meet and greet they will damage your car and not fully own up to it,1
1813,Fine. No major problems.,4
1814,Manchester airport is excellent jet parks 3 not so good,5
1815,An absolute great experience in parking at jet parks manchester and will be using the jet parks again,5
1816,Great airport good motorway access efficient and friendly,5
1817,"Terrible check-in process and security control, creating unnecessary delays.",2
1818,Too expensive and public transport links are needed from west of the airport,2
1819,bus service to and from jet park ringway extremely poor. waited 25 mins to airport and 60 mins on the way back. they should advertise it as 30-60 mins.. at least you know what you're paying for then,1
1820,Ended up on outdoor section quite a walk awayNo disability signs or assistance Won’t be using again,2
1821,"Drop off and collection was fine just what i would expect after paying for a service,however on collection of my car it was obvious my car was left in 3-4"" of muddy water for the whole time for that reason alone i will not use meet and greet again.",1
1822,Easy to find and park. Good bus transport into terminals.,5
1823,Obviously redevelopment is affecting services.  Long time waiting for bus transfer's and car park  very mudry which is then taken into the car.,2
1824,We use this airport mainly for longer haul flights and find it most unwelcoming and unsympathetic to travel weary travellers upon Return to the UK.,2
1825,Awful place with loud and aggressive security staff. Queues everywhere and so expensive!,1
1826,Really easy and convenient- will defo use again,4
1827,Not much can be done to improve things as far as I can see,3
1828,"Although the car park was a little tricky to find at night due to airport improvements, the car park itself was excellent. The transfer bus was regular and not overcrowded and only took a few minutes to get to and from the terminal.",5
1829,Easy to park in short stay and reasonably priced for 4 days,4
1830,Long stay car park is excellent.  Very easy to find and bus service to terminal runs very frequ entry .  Highly recommended,5
1831,Everything was great other than getting a wheelchair from T3 Meet and Greet. The temporary ramps are a disgrace and dangerous .,2
1832,Great car park services and good airport to travel from.,5
1833,A very efficient airport to use - the meet and greet parking facilities are particularly slick and easy to use.,5
1834,Great airport to travel from. Meet and greet car parking in excellent location,5
1835,"Brilliant easy to use service, all booked on line. Have used several times. Would highly recommend.",5
1836,As said in the survey...you fail in the following categories1) poor signage - see the notes as to why2) poor travel routes - see the notes for why3) cleadliness,3
1837,Good airport however T3 lounge is too small for the volume of travellers.,4
1838,Always clean and tidy and very efficient getting you to where you need to be,5
1839,Number plate recognition system Great. Easy access and quick.,5
1840,airport is fine but didn't rate the meet and greet car park experience where all loose change was taken from closed compartment in car.   may only have been about £5 but not good to find that your car has been searched for valuables while it was being parked.   still waiting for an apology from the car park.,1
1841,Easy to find and park. Friendly staff. Car was in good condition and right outside the terminal when returning.,5
1842,"An extremely large car park but very difficult to find an available space. However, once you found a  space everything else was spot on.",5
1843,"This was the first time I had used the Meet and Greet parking service. It is so easy and takes such a lot of stress out of travel. The price was no more than the offsite/bus ride option. The staff were lovely and very friendly. Simply pull up in your car,  hand over the keys and walk a few yards to departures. Excellent. I will definitely be using this service again. Top notch.",5
1844,Terminal 3 very busy not enough seats and places to relax. Security staff need some training on customer service,3
1845,"Excellent meet and greet service, no complaints. Security bit of a long wait but not too bad in April, maybe worse in July!!! Staff at security could have been a tad more friendly, otherwise all other staff helpful, friendly no problems, thank you",5
1846,"Dreadful recent experience of this airport, which I used to use often but haven't used in a while.Firstly, if you've booked parking in Jetparks 1, be prepared to spend 30 mins driving around aimlessly trying to find it. There is no clear signage, and the postcode they provide on the website doesn't work in a SatNav. Such a perfect start to our holiday.Follow that up with a departures security team that could be charitably described as 'possibly on a power trip' and you have the makings of a truly memorable experience. Contrasting this with other airports I have used recently, e.g. Heathrow, Newcastle, Edinburgh and Copenhagen, has laid bare how dreadful an airport Manchester Airport has become. Avoid if you can.",1
1847,Usual good Meet and Greet car parking experience tainted by dirty footprints and muddy stains in foot well caused by the muddy/wet gravel field the cars are parked in. Second time this has happened. Reported it in survey but no one from M&G responded.,3
1848,A very good service which was smoothly and efficiently run and was close to the terminal.  Roadworks made it a little difficult to spot the entrance to the car park on arrival so I hope they aren't there too long.  Collecting the car on our return with the automated key 'locker' system was easy and the car was parked nearby.  Would definitely use again.,4
1849,"There's not enough space to describe all that is wrong with the airport. Dirty, decript, expensive and apparently institutionally offensive security staff.Needs new management from the top down",1
1850,"Easy booking system, and helpful staff.",5
1851,"Convenient, excellent value. Could just fo to make the signs to T3, a bit clearer.",5
1852,I find the on site long stay car parks the best possible option. You never wait long for buses and the bays are clearly marked out for cars. The only downside at the moment is all the building work that is taking place but I realise in the long run this will improve.,4
1853,"Overall, Manchester Airport is very efficient and easy to use. However, they do need to improve directions around the airport particularly to the various car parks during the reconstruction as sat nav does not recognise the temporary roads.  Security and passport control neeeds to be faster.",4
1854,Great. 15 minute wait for shuttle bus on return but overall good experience. Maybe introduce Bus gps app for phone so bus proximity can be tracked.,5
1855,"Used the MEET & Greet service. Car was available and in car park just outside terminal door, good service",5
1856,"When returning from my honeymoon I went to pick up my keys from the ‘Meet and Greet’ and office. I was given my keys and returned to my car to find that the car had a rear flat tyre. From examining the tyre I could see that it had been driven on flat as the side wall of the tyre was marked and damaged. (I have pictures to support this) When returning to the office they looked at the key tag which had been removed and said they had knew that the tyre was flat and that they had put some air in it for me. My question is why did they not inform me at the time of picking up the car keys there was an issue. Your employees have a duty of care to have informed me of the issue. If I had not noticed and driven the car I could have done damage to the alloy wheel or worse on the motorway on my way back to Bradford I could have had an accident. Your colleagues called the onsite “AA” employee and checked the tyre – he also verified that the car had been driven while the tyre was flat and it was damaged. In the mean time someone else was called to put more air in the tyre. They did this and then over a period of time the tyre went down again. After I examined the tyre it was found that there was a large nail in the tyre. (Probably due to all the building work going on at the airport) When trying to get hold of a manager I was told that there was no one available as they were all in meetings. When returning to the Meet and Greet office they came back to the car to take my tyre sizes and offered to replace the tyre. I was told then that it would be 2 hours before they would be on site. You can imagine after coming back from the US on a 10 hour flight, that all these additional delays were not ideal. I would like you to examine your internal procedures and how this has been handled. If I had not noticed the flat tyre there could have been more serious consequences. I was in the airport an additional 4 hours and do not expect this level of service from a Meet and Greet service.",1
1857,Meet and Greet hassle free once through the roadworks.,5
1858,"Over zealous security checks are causing havoc so beware. Hundreds of people being pulled for things like ""chapsticks in coat pockets"". I had 2 charging leads in my rucksack and got extra searches. The problem is they do extra security on so many people the conveyor belts get backed up so no-one else can get through. On top of queuing for 30 minutes to get through a relatively short security line due to the conveyor belt back ups, I was then delayed a further 40 minutes to have my bag ""searched"". The guy didn't even search it. He just looked at the image on the screen and said ""you've got cables in your bag"" and sent me on my way. Sort it out Manchester Airport. I travel regularly from Liverpool and Leeds Bradford and have never ever had these problems before.",1
1859,Meet and greet staff excellent and didn’t charge for extra day taken due to my mistake,5
1860,"we had a pleasant experience using the meet and greet at Terminal 3 Manchester airport, a little pricier than others but right near the arrival/departure door, friendly staff easy to get to,",4
1861,Car returned with a large scratch down the side and caked in mud. Service to sort a disgrace - no offer of compensation for time wasted or state car returned in. Disgusted.,1
1862,Terminal 2 Long stay car parkJokeNo signage due to construction work,2
1863,the cost and timescale of transfer is excellent - signage for car parks could do with improvement!,5
1864,Jet Park 3 is a shambles. No where to park and the buses are very infrequent.,1
1865,"Couldn't be simpler, and pretty decent value when booked well in advance.",5
1866,"A great alternative to London - easy to get to via public transit or Meet 'n' Greet, very friendly airport staff. If you're in Terminal 1 departures the food at ""Giraffe"" restaurant upstairs is amazing.",5
1867,"Got worse since changes inside terminal 1, especially if you have kids, confusing.",1
1868,"missed my flight due to road works just outside jet parks 3 !!! very disappointed as it took over 30 minutes stuck there then once parked waiting for shuttle bus forever, only then realised the bus would be stuck in the same traffic , very disappointed as Manchester airport should find alternate routes without customers who use parking to be sat in traffic just to get into the car parks .",2
1869,first time using meet and greet parking so easy it took the stress out fo some of the holiday experience,5
1870,Always fly from Manchester because of locality to us. Meet and greet is great and overall is a good experience.,4
1871,"Flooded car park. Rude and unhelpful bus driver. Lots of queuing, security and passport control took way too long.",1
1872,"Always use jet parks (1 the most if available) easy and affordable, never a long wait for the buses longest I've waited is 10 minutes",5
1873,"Arrival queue was a bit off putting for a family with small children - the waiting time was too long especially when there were empty auto passport checkers. Children have to be 12 to use it - not sure why.Departures. Laptop bag: remove EVERYTHING including chargers, cables, headphones...isn't that what the scanner does? Basically I put an empty bag and loads of electronics in the trays...I get the removing the laptop bit but not sure about the cables...You do however get the feeling of safety since they literally check EVERYTHING.Overall very good airport, the short stay parking is the best, clean, plenty of seating after you have checked in.",4
1874,"The elevators & areas around in terminal 1 were disgusting , dirty , full of litter I would expect these to be kept clean given the cost of using car park facilities",3
1875,When the car park for m &g is completed it should be great.,5
1876,Poor Meet and greet service.Security service not great.,3
1877,"Great way to start the flight, fast and efficient check in for the car, same on return.",5
1878,"Number plate recognition, very good both inward and outward. Very easy to book and quick. But like everything else, wish it is was less expensive!",4
1879,"This is the Northern Hub  and my home airport, but is let down by long immigration queues on arrival, long baggage recovery waits and insufficient seating in the Terminals",3
1880,Very good and easy booking and easy to follow instructions. Parked in T2 multi storey right next to the terminal with only a short walk.Well worth the money.,5
1881,All went smoothly but refreshment areas a little cramped,4
1882,"great service , good staff , and no waiting for transfer bus",5
1883,T3 Departure Lounge is overcrowded with hardly anywhere to sit,4
1884,Easy access before and after flight home. Very efficiant so thank you. We will definately be using the meet and greet again Staff really co operative  and helpful both before amd returning from holiday Thanks we will definately be using this service again,5
1885,LOVE IDEA OF MEET AND GREET BUT A FEW HICCIUPS MARCH/APRIL 2018 BECAUSE OF ROAD ALTERATIONS,4
1886,At 5am until 9am on Monday 9th April 2018 lots of flights were cancelled due to fog. Airport staff worked hard and we were glad although we took off 1 hour late that we did a,4
1887,"Arrived 3 hours before a long haul flight, check-in arrived an hour after that....Queues were ridiculous.",3
1888,Needs better signs and boarding announcements in the premier lounge are a must.,4
1889,Increasingly busy even outside of the school holidays. Redevelopment of T1 eagerly awaited.,3
1890,Nice Airport despite the amount of works going on.But very grumpy security area staff. i know they do a serious job and must get frustrated with passengers who cant seem to follow notices and signs re liquids/laptops/belts etc but as a frequent traveller every time i get to security i find the staff in there to be mostly borderline rude.,4
1891,don't bother with the long term car park.,3
1892,"Good price, easy booking online, not much of a wait for buses both ways.",4
1893,very poor organisation on arrival - over-booked ?,2
1894,Took a long while to drive to airport but once their got through quite quicky.,4
1895,First class service in the multi-story car park on arrival and return.Not impressed with check-in and security on departure which has brought us to the decision never to fly again!!!,1
1896,Car park long stay terminal 2.good facility with frequent bus service.Needs resurfacing by exit barriers though.,4
1897,"Never use Jet Park Ringway...it was the pits.Three busses went without us..I had to stand in front of the next bus as it approached to make the driver stop..he nearly ran me over...we waited at the bus stop 45 minutes from 4am in the freezing cold when it was supposed to be every 15 minutes.In Terminal Three security my iPad and handbag were kept back..I had nothing to hide,The security man was very rude to me..I wanted to complain at the office but my husband wouldn’t let me...I was extremely upset...A terrible experience.",1
1898,Unaware that vehicles are moved off site over 2 miles away in Alitrincham which isn't a real issue but it would be nice to know.,4
1899,"I always use the official car parks, there are too many cow boys.  Have used the meet and greet many times and it never disappoints",5
1900,Paid for premium parking. Terrible to find.No one about to help. Not worth it,3
1901,Book the lounge and makes good start to holiday.,4
1902,Great location for accessing the terminal. Entry procedure could be better and signage system displaying empty spaces needs improving.,4
1903,"Easy entry, didn’t wait long for a bus plenty of room to park.  Transfers were quick and easy.",4
1904,Excellent service in the meet and greet.  Made travelling easy and stress free.,5
1905,It's a good airport .. and then we got to see Oman airport.. wow,3
1906,"Easy booking, ANPR at car park means not waiting on entry or exit.",5
1907,"Signage leading to the car park needs improvementNeeds electric car chargersNeeds a clean and refurbWe paid £10 extra for premium ""covered"" parking - however premium spaces dont exist in the car park - everyone just parks wherever - there is no allocated parking - so we got ripped off basically.",2
1908,Great carpark and quick shuttle to the airport.,5
1909,"Great service Meet & Greet with no hassle and idiot proof directions, parking drop off, key drop off and return which is in same order reversed.For the extra £10/£15 its helps should you get stuck in traffic and avoids waiting for a bus normally in the rain!",5
1910,"Overall, very smooth drop off and collection of my car, took a large chunk of stress from my journey.",5
1911,"Meet and greet service was great but I didn’t get the valet I paid for and nearly a week after I’m still waiting despite registering the issue when I landed and giving them all the information required.Had no contact since, will be issuing a chargeback with my card provider.Extremely poor",3
1912,Do Not use MAG parking / meet and greet if you have a car you value !,2
1913,"I purchased the fast track service as part of my meet and greet parking but when entering the security i was told that this service was no longer available, i have requested a refund but the request has been ignored to date.The meet and greet once found is pretty good",3
1914,"Meet & Greet, & Multi story car parks are great, however Jet Parks 3 is a grind. Not enough buses and existing roadworks makes the journey to long",4
1915,"The parking was difficult to find and poorly served by the bus service. Passing through security felt intimidating, as if all passengers should be regarded as a potential threat, rather than real people who need reassuring that their safety is the most important concern.",2
1916,"Over Easter, queues were big, even queuing for toilets. Food was expensive. Had to climb a number of stairs at the gate to get to and from the plane with hand luggage. Felt like a rush from start to finish. I understand it was probably busier than usual, but only travel once a year.Place was clean and staff were friendly.",3
1917,"Used many times, will use again",5
1918,Crazy mess at Manchester Airport at the moment. From Jetparks2 its easier to walk to T2,3
1919,Very easy process using the long stay car park at Manchester airport T1/3,5
1920,Excellent and convenient service,5
1921,About time terminal 1 particularly was knocked down and rebuilt!,2
1922,staff are professional.terminal buildings are looking dated,4
1923,A long journey to get there and very busy,2
1924,We really like to park our car here. The staff are always friendly and extremely helpful and look after our cars well. Thanks to you all.,5
1925,Easy acess and good service parking makes this a convenient airport with long haul.,5
1926,Almost missed our holiday due to the poor bus service. Would not recommend. Pay extra and use the airport onsite carpark,1
1927,Long stay terminal 2 car park worked quite well. They are doing construction work so follow signs and not sat nav. Bus transfer excellent.,4
1928,"Manchester T3. Queues, crowded and generally unpleasant.",3
1929,Everything you need to start your trip. Easy to book.  Easy to find following sat nav post code or directions given.  Simple entry and exit.  Close to terminal so no bus required.,5
1930,"Wouldn't use any other car parking service, we now have a toddler in tow and the ease of meet and greet means less stress on all parts, just walk to the terminal from meet and greet which is about a minute away after dropping the keys off. Great service both on departure and arrival, we were on our way in no time!",5
1931,Excellent and would defo recommend,5
1932,big airport with small airport infrastructure.slow security and passport control put me off using this airport.over 1 hour to get through security isn't good enough and must be costing airport £££££ by being so slow as no time to buy a coffee of look in the shopsfind airport staff to be moody and slow also much prefer Liverpool,3
1933,Excellent service makes our holiday easier,5
1934,The road works around Manchester airport are horrendous and the signposting for some of the car parks is completely inadequate.,3
1935,The Meet and Greet car park is excellent and good value for money. Staff are very helpful and it is so easy to find and park.,5
1936,Pleade be carefull when using long stay car park eecurity not good,1
1937,Only one problem with airport restaurants is that they have no or very little gluten free options,4
1938,very efficient entry and exit from the car park,5
1939,"Very good service, would recommend to everyone.  So easy to use, pleasant staff and just across the road from airport.",5
1940,"Excellent hassle free way to park your car safely and secure,also you keep your car keys with you",5
1941,Book direct with the airport meet and greet and multi storey car park as they are great to deal with.,5
1942,"As a disabled customer I rang to check that the transfer buses were disabled friendly and was assured they were. I wanted to park on site for ease but it was £100 as opposed to £39.99 at Jet Park 3 so we booked Jet Park 3. What a nightmare! My husband dropped us off for ease before the holiday and went to park on his own but on arrival home we were advised to all go together as the traffic was bad and was told we could be waiting hours. We got to the queue and fortunately for us the lovely special assistance man took us to the front of the queue. I felt terrible because the people had been waiting for an hour and a quarter already for a bus so there was sooo many people waiting. He said I needed to get on first with my scooter otherwise I would never fit in with all the people and cases! But I didnt fit anyway. It was the tiniest wheelchair space ever and I didnt fit so I was totally blocking the aisle. Everyone was staring and I felt like a second class citizen. The driver didnt seem to have a clue and when we wanted to get off I was completely stuck behind people, cases. My poor hubby had to manoeuvre 5 cases, 2 kids and then me and my scooter past hoards of people. It was a complete  nightmare and when we reached the car I just burst into tears! Being disabled is hard enough without being made to feel a real nuisance, completely in the way and a total burden! Never again!!",1
1943,Really pleased. Very close to terminal and very easy to use,5
1944,only problem was the signage from arrivals to the levels on the multi-storey car park.,4
1945,"Would not use the meet and greet again, was terrible. Easier to park yourself...if you still can? it wouldn’t give me the option for that when I booked.",3
1946,"Easy, friendly and no hassle even when travelling with a toddler.",5
1947,"I paid for a valet whilst away, it was not done, you cannot gey an instant refund even though they have had your money well in advance, they then do not respond when you complain through their recommend channels,  TWICE.  I am disgusted.",1
1948,"Great service, just shame keys weren’t available in automated system as stated on departure meaning we had to queue up to retrieve keys. Minor delay but nothing major. Would recommend for a stress free start to your hols!",4
1949,Good experience flying and parking from Manchester.,4
1950,The meet and greet service is very easy to use.  I had no concerns at all about my car being there when I returned. The  drop-off and collection zone is so close that I had no concerns at all about my personal safety. There was never any waiting about .,5
1951,No issue with the airport service and the car park. Everything went smooth. I would highly recommend it.,5
1952,Manchester airport a total mess as roadworks are being done leave yourself plenty of time,3
1953,Could be better on arrival as took longer to get through than flight,3
1954,Easy to use at a reasonable price if only park8ng for a week.,5
1955,"Excellent price, easy to find and only a couple of minutes from departures.",5
1956,"Only bad thing was the road works and large boarding around airport and car park, not able to see signage on nearby roads,somewhat confusing. Meant we were delayed in getting to car park but rest of booking in at the airport check in desk was quick and efficient.The overall experience of entry and exit to car park was very good once we had found it.",4
1957,The security was a nightmare to get through. They know how many people are coming for flights and yet they stilll did not have all the scanning areas open and they appeared understaffed or not enough staff getting on with it. We were sent to an area where a bag had blocked the scanner and it took ages before anyone noticed it by which time more and more people had been sent to the same area. This is the only aspect that I believe efficiency could be improved to cope with large numbers of passengers.,4
1958,Great parking Saved myself nearly £50 for parking a few minutes walk away in terminal 3 instead of terminal 1 multi storey. Would book again.,4
1959,"Excellent range of parking facilities, welcoming and attentive staff, and comfortable lounge areas.",5
1960,"Easy access into the multi story car park, we would not park our van anywhere else, we travel many times in a year, and there’s never been any problems, Would definitely recommend Manchester Multi Story car park",5
1961,"Really easy, even with 4 children. Didn't have to wait long for bus to collect us. Definately using next time.",5
1962,"Used Jet Parks Ringway for a weeks parking at the beginning of April. Looked online a few weeks before and saw the good price, but didn't book at that time. Left it until the week before flying, so the price had increased, but was still good value for money, will just make sure I book early next time for the best price! Straightforward service, clear markers to show where car is, and numbers on bus stops in car parks (as anywhere though, be sure to make a note / take a picture of car location or bus stop number!). Really helpful drivers, very friendly and patient. Was really impressed on our return home as we were significantly delayed and arrived at the car over 6 hours after the time that I had specified. We had anticipated that there would be an additional charge to pay, but at the barrier, although we had to press the intercom as the barrier did not automatically lift, we were told we must be just within the limit and had the barrier lifted for us. Just what we needed at 7am after spending most of the night on an airport floor - put the first smile on our faces that day! Will definitely use Jet Parks again when flying from Manchester.",5
1963,Arrival was slightly chaotic but a decent experience overall.,4
1964,"Meet and great used to be great but it is struggling with increased demand. The lanes are too narrow, risking car damage. And you are hemmed in by other cars while you try and unload. Quite dangerous with young children. They also need to make sure that trolleys are easily available. They will say they are there, but you simply can't get through six lanes of cars parked bumper to bumper to get to them.",3
1965,Security check up waste too much time. Security staff behave very bad.,2
1966,Terminal 2 is looking a bit tired and there are not enough chairs in the check-in hall. You are told to check-in early but if the desk is not open you have nowhere to sit.,3
1967,pretty good all round service,4
1968,Straight forward and no hassle.,5
1969,Excellent keep up the good work thank you 👍,5
1970,"Even after pre-booking we were charged £164, thankfully we had the voucher confirming we had already paid so they let us out without paying the fee",3
1971,By accident booked T3 (rather than T1) turned up to the barrier and been told the reason I couldn’t book T1 online as it was full hence not showing. The security was so pleasent and changed my booking as it was my first time genuine mistake! He said next time it won’t happen which is fair enough! Good customer service,5
1972,"So easy to use, quick, and friendly service. will be using every time.",5
1973,I love Manchester airport - no complaints.  March/April 2018,5
1974,"Shabby terminal, long time to get out arrivals, muddy car park, good transport links",3
1975,"Excellent, convenient, efficient car parking facility, if a bit pricy",5
1976,Many potholes in the car park and the long wait for the bus transfer was 30 minutes. The drivers are always rude and clearly don’t like their jobs.,3
1977,"The car park jet park ringway was a little hard to find but good, we have no problem getting in or leaving having pre paid months before. We had a very good experience having gone through Manchester airport for the first time.",4
1978,once building work completed should improve .,4
1979,Excellent service start to finish at the airport!,5
1980,T1 is an old tired terminal with lots of stairs up and down to get to the gates or on arrival,4
1981,"Would not recommend Jetparks3. Hard to find, not particularly close to airport, potholes and steps difficult to nvigate with heavy luggage, wait for shuttle bus took 50 minutes",1
1982,"Great service, staff were very helpful!",4
1983,Use the meet and greet at all times its great just to drop your car and go and its so quick and easy on coming back your car is just there waiting for you and after a long flight its just what you need .Had a bit of trouble because could not find are ticket on return so keep your ticket safe Just makes it harder  totally our fault not the car park overall would not use any other why of parking,5
1984,Meet and greet such a quick and easy was to park the car. No hunting through a multi-storey or waiting for a shuttle bus. Car is dropped off and picked up from right outside the terminal,5
1985,A shameful customer experience at Manchester every time we travel,1
1986,"Excellent meet and greet drop off service, works on site by others makesinitial navigation in a bit difficult but the process was quick, efficient and very firendly.  Would definately use again.",4
1987,"Used the Meet and Greet parking at Manchester Airport for the first time in April 2018. At first, the cost seemed a bit steep but, the ease of parking and collecting my car right outside the terminal building made up for it. Friendly and helpful staff coupled with an easy dropoff and collection service = stress-free parking",5
1988,Easy enough to use. Pre-information was good and access was easy. Slightly chaotic waiting for the car park bus on our return and we had a slightly long wait.,4
1989,Easy process. No waiting around. Car was waiting on return. Simple,5
1990,Meet and greet easy fast no problems every time quickest way to start your holiday,5
1991,Great service and good value for money. I use this meet & greet service whenever I travel abroad and have always been happy with the service.,5
1992,I hate having to meander through shops to get wherever I'm going. I know it is marketing and every petrol station etc does it but it is annoying. Otherwise good experience.,4
1993,Not happy with the extra small print telling us that we needed to park in a different car park to what we'd ALWAYS used over the years!,1
1994,No problems with the actual airport but not happy with jet park 3 parking ..it's the second time we've arrived back to a car puncture and this last time some idiot had also reversed into us..with all the money the parking must make they should be proper marked out parking bays that are tarmaced.,3
1995,Great service every time. Always now use Meet & Greet for ease on convienience espcially when travelling with children and luggage!,5
1996,Poor signage but once in the car parking was fine and very close to the terminal,4
1997,Long wait at security but makes you feel safe,5
1998,"Very good, easy to use, an overall good service.",5
1999,it was ok but signposting was not as clear as it could be,4
2000,Check in procedure is generally excellent but on return our car wasn’t ready for collection. Staff were overworked and miserable. Need some customer service training !!,3
2001,"Customer care is the last thing considered. Pensioner with poor mobility, told I can not use terminal parking and will have to pay to be dropped off. Extensively travelled and can not think of an airport on the world that treats its customers so poorly.",1
2002,The service is A1 but the altering of my Stop and Start settings is just not acceptable.To that end you would be better to park your car in the High rise very very disappointed.Especially as it has left me with finding time to take my car to VW dealer and especailly run the car without its Stop/Start engaged for a week which has cost me extra fuel usage.,1
2003,"It is what it is a basic car park, the only downside being lack of signage indicating free spaces.",4
2004,Great friendly staff. Easy no fuss service,5
2005,"Airport is clean and tidy, the only issues we encounted was the car parking, no signs for where to wait for the bus and no markings on the floor for parking spaces plus if you have a large suitcase you have to carry it over the broken stones, also the ryan air self check in was awful with only 2 people to help with no customer care shown.",3
2006,Meet and greet excellent service. Airport spaces and relaxing before departure. Easy to get around and clear directions.,5
2007,"OK, but not ideal car park surface.",3
2008,An excellent service provided by Manchester Airport. Safe and secure.,5
2009,"Most staff friendly, good amount of signs to help, good selection of places to eat and drink before boarding plane.",4
2010,"So easy and near to terminal that it was no bother at all and the staff were good enough to move my car to another terminal I was arriving back at, Excellent service and would recommend as it's worth the money. Thanks.",5
2011,Convenient if expensive,4
2012,So simple. Takes all the hassle out of what is usually a pressurised time.,5
2013,Very good clean & professional through out,4
2014,.Cleanliness an issue. Lounge areas too small/ uncomfortable,2
2015,very good. no problems at all.,4
2016,Short stay car park hasn't enough spaces and spaces are tight. Didn't feel like the premium car park it should have.,3
2017,Excellent Experience,5
2018,Super easy to use. Saves so much hassle and stress with taxis or lifts. I can not recommend more highly.,5
2019,I would recommend this to any of my family and friends,5
2020,"Great service, but you do pay a premium for it!  £10 cheaper and it would be 5 stars!",4
2021,Easy to find and park :) easy for my first time!,4
2022,"Easy, plenty of facilities, close to home",4
2023,My 1st time using meet and greet parking - Will only ever use meet and greet in the future.,5
2024,Multi-storey T£ car park and escape lounge are a perfect stress free way to start any holiday!,5
2025,Excellent service albeit expensive. Parked in T1 Manchester Meet and Greet. Easy to find following the online directions provided when the booking was made. Car left on arrival without any fuss and was ready when returned on time based on the flight arrival. Everything was well explained online and by the staff who took the car keys on departure. Very convenient and would definitely use again despite the price.,5
2026,"Generally a great experience, but passport control queues are slow at times.",4
2027,"T2 M&G was dirty/muddy in the indoor collection area, which shoes and cases transferred to the car!Hope to fly from T1 next time!",2
2028,Excellent access to airport terminals and reasonable value for money.,4
2029,"The jet parks are just a space of flat gravel no body actually working on site, the jetpack site have the wrong postcode too, which was a costly mistake for us, adding to the stress of the arrival to the terminal on time.",4
2030,Airport good meet & greet service a complete joke no meeting or greeting! Just an overpriced car park! Also staff in restaurants the least helpful and baby friendly ever.,3
2031,highly recommended service easy to use and good value for money,4
2032,"BOOKING EASY. CAR PARK SIGNPOSTING COULD BE BETTER. BARRIER RAISED WITHIN 10 SECONDS, SPACES EASY TO FIND, BUS CAME QUICKLY, ALL STOPS NUMBERED IN LARGE WRITING. TRANSFER TO TERMINAL QUICK. ON RETURN, BUS WAS AT TERMINAL WITHIN 2 MINUTES, TRANSFER QUICK, DRIVER VERY HELPFUL, WE HAD WRITTEN DOWN OUR NEAREST BUS STOP NUMBER - VERY IMPORTANT! CAR FOUND IMMEDIATELY, BARRIER RAISED WITHIN 10 SECONDS, JOB DONE. THIS IS HOW IT SHOULD BE.",5
2033,There is so much building work going on around terminal 2.  With very little signage it was difficult to find the Meet and Greet car park.  There is quite a walk from the temporary reception to departures and this wouldn't be acceptable if one had walking difficulties.  I am hoping this will improve when the car park is moved completely.,4
2034,Great experience and very easy to get around.,5
2035,"Easy to get to get in and right next to airport! Really good sequrity bus drivers are really nice, car parks have loads of space I’d defiantly use next time.",5
2036,"Airport is fine, long stay car park is a total mess.",4
2037,I compIetely messed up my car parking arrangements at MIA the other week and was saved by a very polite and pragmatic approach by a member of staff who really did help me sort things out.  She could not have been more helpful.   I would like to say a big thank you to the woman who helped me sort out my car parking in SSP3 and transferred me without any fuss to T1 and T3 which made life much easier for me on 28th March 2018.,5
2038,The staff where friendly and were great with us as I had a hidden disability.,5
2039,Super facility with high security & excellent location outside T1. Will always use in preference to others who take car off site.,5
2040,"The assistant on the information desk in Terminal 3 was more interested in sorting out his lieu time on the phone than talking to us.  We arrived at the desk, he looked at us and then made his lieu time phone call.  He didn't even acknowledge we were there or even allow us to say anything.  He was on the phone arguing for over 5 minutes.  He was unfriendly and unhelpful.",3
2041,meet and greet works but Manchester airport baggage colleciton needs a review,4
2042,"Car park is the best part - Airport is dated and security checks are similar to that of a third world, very backwards. Needs updating and perhaps they could do with friendlier boarder control and security check personnel too.",3
2043,Signage and directions to and from T3 long stay multi storey are very poor.,3
2044,"Best way to park your car for a business trip, and hardly any more expensive than the long stay car park. Arriving back late at night, cuts half an hour off waiting for the shuttle bus and finding your car",4
2045,Meet and greet is just not worth the hassle.  It's inconvenient.  On arrival you have to lug your suitcases pretty far to get your keys back to then have to (depending on where you're parked) lug your suitcases back the way you came to get your car which defeats the purpose of what you're supposedly paying for.  Do yourself a massive favour and don't bother with the Manchester Airport meet & greet con.,2
2046,Bus signs wrong.  Hardly any buses.  Muddy. Unfriendly staff.,1
2047,Never bring a golf umbrella or security  will steal it without  any justification.,2
2048,"Very good airport, could be a little bit cleaner, though.",4
2049,Would recommend meet & greet service at Manchester airport,5
2050,"Excellent service, peace of mind",5
2051,Very good once you have dropped your luggage off. It could do with better seating if you are early.,4
2052,"I booked premium parking at Terminal 2. Arriving at 3am to find no signage.Fortunately I had used Google street view before I left home and then realised where I needed to be. The barrier recognised my car but again poor or non existent signage to tell you to go to the roof. Car park was as near as you can get to the terminal and a good place to leave your car, but signage needs to be improved. General Airport signage could be improved internally also. We were asked to empty out electrical items from cabin bag for scanner but other European airports don't do this ?",4
2053,"Nice airport, ridiculously expensive to park though.",2
2054,This airport need to sort out it security check area it is a mess disorgsnised and you need a separate disabled persons area stop lumping disabled peopke with familied and push chairs it does not work,4
2055,"Excellent facilities at Manchester Terminal 3 for car parking. Good value for money, easy to locate, close to terminal.  Also used the 1903 lounge before departing, fantastic staff and an excellent facility. Would definitely use both next time I am travelling.  Well done Terminal 3.",5
2056,"Car park post code wrong, nearly missed our flight.",1
2057,"Well organised and good value, would recommend.",5
2058,Trouble free parking 5 min walk from the terminal entrance!,5
2059,Straightforward and easy to find car park. Was disappointed to have paid for Premium Parking but no spaces available. Had to park an another level.,4
2060,"Manchester was our airport of choice with car parking at Long Stay 1 & 3 so convenient and easy with plenty of bus stops and very frequent bus shuttles to the terminals even though we are older citizens it wasn't a problem but now it is a nightmare - poor lighting most bus stops defunct and the bus drivers clearly fed up with their limited services being verbally berated by passengers. Do not use this car park if you have any mobility difficulties or small children it will be a nightmare. especially at night. The airport staff are generally very polite and helpful, its just the infrastructure which is lacking.",3
2061,"I regularly use terminal 3 multi storey and I have been able to take advantage of offers this winter 2017/8. Entry and exit are a breeze and I am soon onto the motorway and on my way home. Finding a parking space can be a lottery but i have always found a space and the carpark layout makes the spaces easy to park into.  One caution is that following the diversion signs for terminal 3 is not the easiest way to get to the car park entrance, follow terminal 1 until the rounderbout and then take the first exit to terminal 3 and the car park is just on the right.",4
2062,"Perfect easy system , always works well",4
2063,"Used the Meet and Greet service and it all happened just as it should do.  On the return we were away in our car 15 minutes after leaving the plane and that included going through passport control, collecting hold baggage and getting our car back.  Difficult to see how this could be improved really.",5
2064,Termnal 2 car park easy to access and makes the trip less stressful,5
2065,Expensive as far as car parking goes there are cheaper alternatives Not very well sign posted Clean and tidy and great access to airport,3
2066,Excellent service. Definitely recommend,5
2067,This is the first time i used the ringway. Waiting time was about 5 mins and it took less than 10 min to get us to the terminal the shuttle took us outside arrivals and thats where we caught the shuttle back from our journey. I would recommend to anyone satisfied with the service and experience would use this service again..,5
2068,"Good access and efficient passenger processing. Road works make things difficult, but should result in a large improvement. Great access to M-Ways.",4
2069,Excellent service. Thanks Subhrasish.,5
2070,"One of the worst airports I know. Traffic can be a mess, car parks are not in good condition, security check patronising and badly organised.",1
2071,"Travelled alone with two children, parked with jetpark was cheap and well organised with frequent busses. Staff were helpful and friendly. A pleasant experience overall",5
2072,Meet and greet sent me to wrong terminal said in black and white terminal 2 got there unloaded park car then was told you need terminal 1 even though it said terminal 2 on paper work,1
2073,Very easy to use. I was on meet and greet and had very friendly staff. Would definatly recomend,5
2074,Easy to find close and speedy,4
2075,Easy online booking,5
2076,"Pretty efficient good value for money , could have more sign posts in place and possibly tarmaced",3
2077,Baggage took ages to come out even though the screen said all baggage was in belt still took a further 30 mins to arrive,4
2078,Easy start to the holiday,5
2079,Nice and easy to use. Saves a lot of hassle with arranging lifts or taxis and wondering if they will be there when you arrive back. Will use again for sure.,5
2080,"Airport Great, complete nightmare trying to find ringway car park due to lack of signage. Took us 35 minutes to find",3
2081,"As expected, security is an endurance, very poor customer experience. Good selection of shops and food outlets. Great choice of destinations.",3
2082,"Closed Bus stops due to building work, meant we had to walk half the length of the car park, which wasn't ideal due to my wife suffering with a bad back and walking difficulties.",3
2083,Damaged suit cases on arrival and Jet2 park bus driver driving carelessly nearly knocking us with our own damaged suit cases!,2
2084,"Not any where near the standard of foriegn airports , go look at Faro !!!!! is Manchester not bigger than Faro ?????? Arrivals passport check area needs a big look at unorganised not big enough like a cattle market embarassing and impersonal",3
2085,"Don't consider T2 Long Stay Car Park as an option - overpriced, undergoing construction and far far away if you'd like to save some money and you are not flying from the same terminal.",2
2086,"Parking is a smooth process, security could be improved by the staff being more polite , some are very rude",4
2087,"On booking the parking, I did not receive any direction to the car park, I phoned for the post code, which one was given to me, on arriving I received a token whit I thought was odd, on the way out I tried to exit, I was told I had to pay £68 to exit, chard £68.00 minus £29. 00 that I already paid, would have been cheaper if I had used taxi.",1
2088,Airport experience was up to good standard but let down tremendously by Jet Parking with unacceptable wait times and ill-mannered drivers which will mean a change of arrangements for parking on next trip.,2
2089,"Very good, efficient, no problems at all.",5
2090,Very competitive price plenty of room and very good bus service no complaints at all with the car park we used jet parks 3,4
2091,"Over priced money-stealing trolleys, poorly laid out and generally quite hard work getting through this airport. Machines to check in bags and drop them off. Big queues at nearly every point. Meet and greet parking very expensive. We will probably stick with Liverpool where possible in the future.",2
2092,its as good an airport as any and better than some,5
2093,Great parking facilities easy to book friendly staff,5
2094,One of the easiest airport journeys I have done in a long time. Staff were friendly and helpful throughout,4
2095,Excellent and very convenient to use.,5
2096,"A total shambles of a check-in procedure, East Midlands for us next time!Treated like cattle throughout the process, only met a pleasant member of staff when they were trying to extract more money from me.",1
2097,"Manchester Airport runs a great system well organised but can get very busy with some queuing at busy times. The immigration queuing is also annoying because being forced to use an unfamiliar system causes delays. I would always use a desk against a machine and it should be my own choice. Lastly the delays in collecting luggage why does one case come quickly and then a 30 mins wait for the second, I know thats life of a traveller live with it.",5
2098,Meet and greet is good the rest are mediocre,3
2099,Hassle free parking wouldn’t use anywhere else.,5
2100,"I have been using this airport for 15 years now and I have definitely noticed a dip in standards over the past few years. I have grown to dread using the packed out Terminal 3 with it's long queues but today's experience was absolutely terrible. There was a huge queue at border control upon our arrival at Terminal 3 and we were stuck in it for at least 40 minutes. This led to us missing our train and having to buy a new one. The only reason given by an employee was that there was a staff 'changeover'.Very disappointed and will be trying to avoid this airport, particularly Terminal 3 at all costs.",2
2101,Poor signage made it difficult to find and I expected an indoor car park however good to know my car was safely parked until my return to the uk,3
2102,Great service,5
2103,"Convenient parking with plenty of bus stops, it would be helpful if these were illuminated after dark.",4
2104,The current road works makes accessing the correct terminal a bit of a nightmare.  Otherwise ok.Object somewhat to the lengthy walk through Terminal 2 Duty Free.,4
2105,Great service and value for money.  Vehicle is safe while your on holiday and there waiting just outside arrivals on your return.,5
2106,Overall a good experience. T2 Long Stay car park the spaces need to be slightly wider to accomodate the larger vehicles that seem to use this car park.,4
2107,"Possibly the worst airport I have used. Frequent flyer from Manchester and it gets worse every time I use it. Poor customer service, appauling facilities and just too many passengers for the size of the airport. Car parks although reasonably priced are dirty and the booking process online doesn't always work properly. Security screening although completely necessary is a very stressful experience with rude staff, poorly maintained equipment and just generally not a smooth process. Restaurants in every terminal are poor and quite dirty and poorly maintained. Shops, as we come to accept, are very expensive for general goods. Passport control when returning is awful. UK citizens have to queue for longer then international citizens! Every other airport I've been to I have seen Citizens of that country breeze through passport control. Baggage reclaim is another matter entirely. An A380 flight has 600 passengers with probably 2000 bags onboard. The reclaim area is so cramped and the carousel so small that there isn't room to even get your bag when you see it! Unfortunately Manchester is my closest Long haul international airport otherwise I would certainly use a different airport. I dread booking a holiday and having to fly from Manchester. Even contemplated flying Liverpool to London and then onwards just to avoid this airport!",2
2108,Not the most good looking airport. It seems to be constantly too busy for its capacity,3
2109,Passport control is slow and security is often a burden compared to EU airports.,4
2110,Jet 2 self check in Watched us struggle shouted over instructions.Staff on plane rolled eyes at passengers Miserable faces,3
2111,"Friendly staff, clean well served with facilities. Needs better signposting to assistance areas",4
2112,Disappointed with Terminal 1 long stay car park bus transfer too and from Terminal. I had not been made aware of the disruption to the facility due to building works. Plus on our return had to wait 25 minutes in the pouring rain with a baby and young child for a bus.,2
2113,Easy to book and car park easy to find once you work out that the signage is different to the booking name!,4
2114,Excellent meet and greet service very professional have used on many occasions without any problems 10/10,5
2115,"Meet and greet car parking is excellent, absolutely no complaints. Terminal 3 departure lounge needs more seating, it’s like a cattle market.Terminal 3 arrivals is horrendous! Queues, machines and impatient staff- totally inefficient and embarrassing to watch foreigners being treated this way after we’ve been treated much better in their country.",3
2116,"VIP Lounge was good, comfortable seating but the choice of food wasn't as good as expected from when I booked it.Getting through security is still a slow and painful experience due to many people not correctly planning what they can bring on board. A separate aisle for those with no hand luggage would be a great addition.",4
2117,Car parking at Manchester airport easy and convenient. From booking on line to leaving after the trip all good,5
2118,"Efficient and friendly staff even though major renovations taking place. Will travel from Manchester again, it’s so easy",5
2119,I don't really like airports but Manchester has improved.,4
2120,"Clean airport, helpful staff... Could do with more staff or better directions.",5
2121,Great choice of flights but the security experience and queues at passport control are ridiculous,3
2122,"Car park lifts to get into terminal 1 from the multistory was a horrible, stressful experience, especially on our return.  People were pushing in and were aggressive, not nice when you have little children with you.  There needs to be a better queuing system and perhaps monitored by staff.  The signposting wasn’t good and we got lost trying to get in and out of the terminal.  Security was ridiculous and queued for an hour and a half.  The airport once through security was fine and the experience improved.",3
2123,"Apart from the car collection on return when the road was up and the signage to the car park was insufficient, this was a good efficient service at a reasonable cost.",4
2124,every thing is so easy straight through barrier in line out of the car drop keys at office and your away its a must if you just want to get home after a long flight,5
2125,"Terminal 1 is good both for access and egress.Terminal 2 is not good, and terminal 3 is nice and quiet.",4
2126,Great airport - always a pleasant experience.,5
2127,"Difficult place to fly from at moment. Traffic lights ,road alterations and mass building project is a nightmare.",4
2128,"In general good experience at airport with friendly staff and minimal queues on day i travelled. But note if you prebook short stay parking at Terminal 3, you need to look out for a sign that says SSP - and SSP only!  i drove round 3 ring road 3 times before realising that i needed to decipher the short hand version of the car park name, in order to access the parking i had booked ...",4
2129,Time taken to move through security could be better managed.Staff in departures need to be more polite and not look at everyone as if they are a suspect.,3
2130,although it does need a make-over Manchester airport is an ok place to start your journey. I fly almost every week and know quite a few of the staff by sight now. They are always helpful as I am sure they have to deal with some less savoury characters in their jobs - poor them. I absolutely do not agree with the proposed charge to drivers for merely dropping off passengers. If you get caught in heavy traffic by the terminals - really who cares. If you drive to the terminal you have to expect it to be busy but the airport authorities extracting yet more money for nothing from motorists is highway robbery - literally..!!,4
2131,"Good facilities except for the security process. Not enough staff and X-ray machines, so always very slow. They have full time staff whose job is to help travellers who wouldn’t otherwise make it through in time, and boy do they need them !",3
2132,Found airport easy to navigate and got through customs quickly.,5
2133,great and relaxing way to depart and arrive .,5
2134,"Car parking at Manchester airport is appalling for disabled passengers. Firstly, the website isn’t clear about the best car park to use for being close to the terminal. There isn’t a designated disabled car park, only disabled spaces in all car parks with the use of a transfer bus which is difficult and impractical when travelling with luggage. We are a family of 3, 2 of which are in manual wheelchairs when travelling. As it was unclear on the website where would be the best place to park so we didn’t pre-book and waited to see where would be best when we got there (we had not parked at this airport before). Due to the 2 hours it took us to find car parking, park, transfer and get from bus stop into terminal we missed our flight. Obviously if we had pre-booked parking this may have been avoided, but the website does not provide the information you need to choose the correct car park for your needs. Airport assistance isn’t available until you actually reach the terminal so you are on your own from the bus stop to the terminal,, T1 has a steep decent to the terminal which is difficult  and unsafe to self propel down. Ideally there should be a designated disabled car park next to the terminal with assistance call phones from car park to departure. The current system could be improved by making the website clearer for disabled passengers, showing transfer times from car park to airport and putting assistance call phones at the terminal bus stops for assistance to the departure terminal.",1
2135,"Used Jetparks3, bus dirty, driver doesn't give you enough time to load all your skibags before setting off, unacceptable delay at T junction before car park",2
2136,Clearly a great deal of work going on so currently like a building site but I'm sure it will improve the experience next time!,3
2137,Excellent service from start of my journey to coming home. They went above and beyond. Apart from the 3 hour Jet2 delay Manchester was amazing.,5
2138,"Terrible. Due entirely to the alteration to the approach to the airport - the roadworks are terrible, very poorly signposted and very confusing, trying to navigate this at night is almost impossible. Once you have entered the airport and departure terminal it was the usual experience - some frustrations but generally ok.",3
2139,"Although building work is taking place outside of terminal 1, signage is clear.  Airport clean with plenty of facilities.",4
2140,whilst I like Manchester airport and the ease of getting to it finding the security staff seem to be getting less customer focused - verging on being rude.,3
2141,"Getting through security checks is a nightmare, it took us almost 2 hours to get through what can only be described as a chaotic experience.",2
2142,Infrequent bus arrival times they do arrive but when stated slow timeVery slow baggage reclaim slow time,3
2143,"Great, until I returned to a flat battery due to staff leaving my headlights on",3
2144,"Accessing terminal building from meet and greet, and the first obstacle you face is steps! Most heavy cases these days run on casters, so a ramp would seem more appropriate.",3
2145,Asks relevant questions and is easy to use.,5
2146,Very efficient service at a reasonable price,5
2147,"Parking was awful despite paying the top price for so-called ""Meet and Greet"" (more like throw your car into a lane and jump out before the next one runs you over)! Airport woefully unable to deal with passenger footfall. Check-in too ages, security was chaos.",2
2148,"Security and immigration staff are still among the rudest in Europe - security and immigration feel like a cross between a borstal and a cattle market.Place feels crowded, not enough areas to sit, dreadful food options for those with allergies - I still have to bring my own food and milk.Car parking with Meet and Greet excellent otherwise this would be one star.",2
2149,"needs an update, facilities decor, restaurants and shops are poor for an international airport",2
2150,Long wait at check in and security - one hour - told by official that fast track was slow track today,3
2151,"I have used jeparks 3 on a number of occasions and have always been picked up by a bus within 10 min, however on 17th of March we were left standing in the snow for over an hour, and only just made the checkin for our flight. Buses did not stop for us because they were full.",2
2152,"Car park meet and greet hard to follow signs through roadworks, very long security queue of 90 mins unacceptable",2
2153,Used both T2 & T3 Meet & Greet in the last month. Both were so easy to use. Would not use independant M&G companies again if Manchester Airport maintain cost at present levels.,5
2154,"I had my car valeted prior to my trip only to get back into my car to find dust and debris in both front and rear of the car, I understand that it is parked off site so expect maybe some in the drivers seat but again this could be resolved with a paper inlay that most garages use. Other than that an excellent service, staff are pleasant and helpful carpark is easy to find and transition through the process was easy, as was picking up the car",5
2155,"Couldn't be easier,",5
2156,"Terminal 2 is under development. Internally not much disruption, but the car parks (Jet) are poorly maintained,lack signage and the BUS SERVICE AN ABSOLUTE JOKE!",3
2157,Very good service overall and quality for money.,5
2158,I use this service every time I travel and I wouldn’t use any other method The staff are excellent and the convenience cannot be beaten takes some of the stress out of flying,5
2159,Convenient and friendly service,4
2160,Return journey to jet parks ringway was appalling had to wait 35mins in the freezing cold for the bus to arrive when it is supposed to be every 10-15mins. When raised with the driver he just shrugged his shoulders and laughed clearly on a very long cig break!,3
2161,"Departure security was a very intimidating, chaotic experience!",2
2162,"Transfer bus drivers rude and unhelpful, manic at security and long walks often stairs from plane to passport control",3
2163,"Terminal 2 Departures a bit small and boring, but got a very decent rate on the multi storey car park in the sale, security was quick, gate was close by, we departed pretty much on time and there were no issues. Arrival had one of those annoying buses, but passport control was speedy and bag arrived after a shortish wait. Getting a coffee for drive home took ages at Caffe Nero so was glad multi storey is so close to the terminal building. No issues with the licence plate recognition leaving car park so I was on my way in no time after throwing bags in the boot. Will definitely use again - and I live in Birmingham!",4
2164,Brilliant parking system. ANPR was excellent and so easy to get to departures and car park on arrival.,5
2165,Good value. Excellent for getting to terminal quickly.,5
2166,Really slow fast track T3! I needn’t have bothered. Over an hour to get through security with fast track is just not providing a good enough service for me. I’ll be using Leeds and Bradford from now on wherever possible.,2
2167,Great parking in the multi-storey across from terminal. Good check-in and customer service within airport including vouchers when delayed.Only downside was extremely long wait for baggage (over an hour) on our return which seemed excessive as we were only plane to land at that terminal at that time and there was only 150 passengers plus crew as plane was empty. Not what was needed after a 3hr delay on a transatlantic flight,4
2168,Dated airport but functional. Staff not too friendly.,4
2169,Serious problems accessing terminal 3 due to badly set lights.  Transport Police at the airport rude and clearly disinterested.  Customer service a priority to no-one it would seem.,2
2170,got help when checking in and I was confused made it really easy for me and assisted fullylost my bar code receipt on return 100% help and assistance yet again fantastic staff and experience,4
2171,"Terminals 1 and 3 are really in need of a serious makeover. I used to feel like MIA provided an a fairly enviable airport experience, whereas now it feels overcrowded and increasingly down at heel. The shopping areas are of course spick and span, but the rest feels like some serious money needs spending. C'mob MIA, you used to be so good ...what happened?",3
2172,Manchester Terminal One is tired and need a make over.  Get rid of all those shops before you enter the departure lounge.,3
2173,"I have always found the multi-storey car park to be very convenient and good value for money, particularly when using the discount promotions.",4
2174,"Easy booking, in and out, but very pricey for a single day.",4
2175,"I use Manchester airport because it goes where I want and it is one of the closer airports to where I live. It is not the nicest of experiences though. Sometimes overcrowded in the departure area, and poor signage to car parks on arrival.",3
2176,"AVOID THE PARK AND RIDE AT ALL COSTS! STAFF ARE RUDE AND IT’S LIKE A MAZE TRYING TO FIND THE BUS STOPS. THERE ARE NO SIGNS OR STAFF TO GUIDE YOU (ONLY THE VOICE OF THE INTERCOM, WHO CLEARLY LIVES HIS JOB - NOT!!)",1
2177,"Check in is a joke, especially when they make you carry your bags to an other area and then this causes them to be lost, or actually not make the flight. Security is a mess as they just can’t cope. I suggest if travelling via Manchester you get there a long time before your flight. Also, they don’t care and won’t help even when you ask them too.",1
2178,Very poor wrong post code for jetpark 1 then was told to follow the signs! What signs? Once in what can only be discribed as a flooded field we then couldn’t find a space because loads of people had parked over 2 spaces. No one on hand to help out a fellow Customer had to help find us a space. Then on return low and behold the barrier wouldn’t let us out to go home and again no one on site to help! Never Again!!,1
2179,"Excellent facility, easy to access with great bus service.",5
2180,Couldn’t book meet and greet.Roadworks are a major problem.Jet Parks Ringway is too far away with infrequent bus service.Security control is a pain.Forced route through shopping is an imposition.Baggage reclaim is inefficient.,2
2181,First time using the park and ride. Would recommend if anyone wanted to try it out .,5
2182,I found the meet and greet to be an easy experience with very helpful staff both when checking in my car and upon collection when returning to Manchester.  I would certainly use this again.,4
2183,Great Service...would highly recommend!!!,5
2184,"A lot of construction work on going, but seemed well laid out and controlled.",4
2185,"Helpful and welcoming staff at the Meet and Greet. The rest of the customer experience at Manchester is dreadful. Congestion caused by poor signs resulting in ""lost"" customers blocking routes through the airport. Poor layout at security check where queries about luggage content hold up every one in that aisle. Having to walk through the sales floor of the shops to get to the departure areas. The airport appears more concerned about retailing than supporting people to get onto their flight. Poorly designed and poorly operated systems.",1
2186,Found the location very poor. Directions provided to locate car park were not correct.  Help provided by staff at airport who said people regularly have problems finding the car park of Jet Parks1. Found it very stressful.,1
2187,Drivers need there understand service with a smile,3
2188,Everything went smoothly on departure and arrival back at Manchester.  I would recommend the Meet and Greet Service at Terminal 1 definitely.,5
2189,From arrival to departure with car park long stay 1/3 Very satisfied though the Facilities inside Terminal 1 post security especially Food/Drink was poor and very congested and needs to be well spaced.Security was very efficient both before and after.,5
2190,Ideal car parking for quick entry and getaway would reccomend.,5
2191,Good entry and exit procedure - could do with clearer signing from the terminal for those who walk,4
2192,Jet 2 Departures b is far to slow when clearing security. After queuing for ages then reaching the point of being scanned we were diverted to another queue further along and had to queue again. We cleared security just as the gate opened to board. Very stressful!!,3
2193,Security was a joke at car park. Car broken into and was laughed at by security upon reporting it. Very dismissive and fast track didn’t work In Lisbon.,3
2194,Good facility only let down by offering fast track and taking payment for it and then don't give you tickets Going through security is very important but could do with massive improvements,4
2195,Everything well planned. Friendly staff guided us to our parking bay on arrival. Helpful staff pointed out where our car was when we returned. A lot cheaper than getting a taxi.,5
2196,Construction work at airport means 1000’s of traffic comes and varying access routes and lanes,3
2197,Manchester is undergoing a lot of changes at the moment and the staff are doing their best - it’s still a great place to travel from - much less hassle than London.,4
2198,You get shouted at going through security,4
2199,We always use meet & greet for ease as it is so close to the terminal. The service has been great every time.,4
2200,very easy to park and get to terminal,5
2201,Sadly now one of the worst airports in the world....,1
2202,"manchester airport, convenient to get to, good duty free service and meet and greet excellent",5
2203,"My Car has been damaged, feel like some one has hit the car.Never recommend this car park to anyone,",1
2204,"Easy to find your way around, however, long waiting hours on arrival !",4
2205,Good experience. Friendly staff and good amenities,5
2206,the only problem was getting through security as I was travelling with an assisted passenger. it was very slow and somewhat chaotic. the staff were excellent however and dealt with use with great humour and did their very best.,4
2207,Bus service to and from the Long Stay carparks is absolutely dire!!!!!,1
2208,Easy to find and use. Friendly staff very close to terminal,4
2209,They've got my money by prepayment. Do they care that the bad facilities enfuriate me? I suspect not,1
2210,Gone downhill in recent years. Chaotic meet and greet on our return. Would fly from another airport if feasible.,3
2211,"Generally good, however the food service did not open early enough for us to havee breakfast without the strong possibility of missing our 5.30am flight.",4
2212,Easily accessed Airport with convenient car parking adjacent check-in.Recommended.,5
2213,"Check in at 04.00 hrs was very slow, the oversized baggage area was shocking and very slow, Arrivals was very poor , customs was as always slow, but the return transfer to JetParks was the worst.",2
2214,Due to construction the car parking is a bit confusing but not an issue,3
2215,Car parking very easy.  Gate 30 was unheated though Which was a real problem as we had to wait there for over two hours.,3
2216,"went with jet2.com this time and found the check in a big improvement, would use again",4
2217,"Despite major renovations the overall departure experience was great. Car parking collection also excellent and straightforward. Arrivals experience at Manchester terminal is whole other matter - worn, dirty, no information, baggage delays and don’t ask about the ladies toilets cleanliness. I was embarrassed that this is the first view for people visiting the UK",5
2218,Car parking was simple and the easiest part.. Once we left there everything else was a nightmare.By the time we cleared security they were calling our names over the tannoy for boarding.No time for a sandwich or coffee.Really made me wish we had gone to Liverpool,2
2219,NOTHING BETTER THAN RETURNING HOME FROM A HOLIDAY KNOWING YOUR CAR IS JUST OUTSIDE AT MEET n GREET AND YOUR'E ON YOUR WAY BACK HOME!!,5
2220,Great airport with friendly staff and THE most efficient security process I have experienced. Official car parking in Jet Parks is awful. You pay good money to park in a flooded wasteland and then stand in said wasteland for 40mins.,4
2221,"Ease of access, helpful staff, even a 17 hour delay home was t an issue for them and no cost, made sure I was ok getting to my car.",5
2222,Make sure you get the times sport on or they charge you addition £15 to get ur own car back. Like we don’t pay enough to park in first place and you don’t even guarantee a parking spot in some of the car parks,2
2223,"Car parking experience excellent, T1 security checks a total shambles, 25 mins waiting after passing thro the body scanner,  for tray, with a belt, phone, kindle, shoes, to be told nothing wrong with it!!!",5
2224,"Easy to find, busy in food areas, easyJet plus booking was brilliant, no waiting at check in, fast track security, priority seating excellent.",5
2225,"the toilets in t3 were extremely dirty, with no one at hand to clean them.one of the security operatives at terminal 3 was extremely rude to travellers, who obviously struggled with rules and searches. the rest of the security staff were fine, doing a difficult job, well..",3
2226,"I recently flew from Manchester Airport with my mother who requires assistance. We used the Meet & Greet car parking, which was excellent, dropping & picking your car off just across from the departures/arrivals - I would recommend this to anyone. The staff were really friendly, we were given priority through security & when boarding the plane.All in all flying from Manchester was an excellent experience.",5
2227,"Best airport in the North of England. Easy motorway access, great choice of destinations and airlines.",5
2228,"I paid for RESERVED parking, but did NOT get what I paid for. NExt time, I will just pay for general parking instead of being defrauded",1
2229,Massive queues and rude staff at passport control on arrival. Staff seemed under a lot of pressure. Not enough of them. The automatic passport scan machines just slow everything down as lots of people seem to be 'rejected' by them and have to go through a manual process anyway!,3
2230,JP1 like a ploughed field and too expensive for the quality. Bus service on return very poor quality. Overall needs investment to upgrade.,1
2231,"THE WEBSITE IS AND ABSOLUTE CON AND WE BOOKED WITH THE PROPER MANCHESTER AIRPORT PARKING SITE. IT DOSE NOT TELL YOU TO BOOK IN THE 24 HR CLOCK. SO HAVING ARRIVED BACK FROM HOLIDAY AT 10 PM WE WERE CHARGED AN EXTRA £20 AS WE HAD ONLY BOOKED TILL 10AM.  ALSO WE PAID £89.99 FOR 7 DAYS ANOTHER COUPLE ON THE SAME TRIP PAID £40.  THE ""HELP"" STAFF AT THE BARRIER WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE AND JUST SAID TOUGH PUT YOUR CARD IN THE MACHINE THEN CUT US OFF.""NEVER EVER AGAIN""",1
2232,Nearly spent the night at Terminal 2 multi-storey car park last night! It would not have been a GOOD night! Our plane landed @ Manchester from Salzburg at 19.15. We went to collect baggage but suddenly - half way through delivery - the belt stopped. The reason soon became apparent. At 19.35 FOUR flights had landed from Doha and their luggage had been given priority unloading. We hung around with about half our flight's holidaymakers... until our other luggage was finally delivered. On exiting the airport we found the whole of the T2 Multi-storey car park had been turned into a pick-up point for the Doha flights. There were taxis and cars blocking the exit lanes on several floors and we were effectively 'trapped' in the car park! What a shambles...no airport staff on hand to help and when we eventually got to the exit our pre-booked payment failed to allow us to exit. Apparently Manchester Airport have designated the car park as a drop off/collection zone and are aware of the problems for long stay customers - but aren't prepared to warn them when they pre-book the Multi-Storey!   SHAMBLES it was! We paid for the multi-storey in order to save time using the buses for the Long Stay T2. I believe we were 'trapped' in the multi storey car park for about an hour! Very poor service - no traffic management...best use Long Stay 2 and bus to save time and money!!,1
2233,Car parking good airport experience lagging behind most large overseas terminals,3
2234,"ANPR cameras for car park entry & exit don't always work.Passengers boarded onto plane and then kept waiting - on the plane - for three hours for de-icing. Why not keep passengers in the lounge until the plane is ready to go?Passport control on return - those machines cause endless confusion and are slooooooow. More staff manning more desks please.Baggage reclaim - just in case you forgot you were on a budget airline, we're going to make you wait 45 minutes for your baggage.",2
2235,"Its an airport. Not much more can be said. Departures area not so comfy, insufficient seating. Have to walk through shops after security. Immigration queues can be large and half the automated terminals were out of action. Could be a lot more pleasant than it actually was.",3
2236,"Fairly reasonable for the price. Little bit difficult finding a space, especially in the dark. Be VERY sure to remember bus pick-up shelter number for your return,and where you parked Tip,take a photo on your phone.",4
2237,I would not expect to pay for fast track through security only to have to wait two hours in line.Other than that I was really happy.,4
2238,Excellent service from arrival to departure.,5
2239,Meet & Greet parking good. Departing and arriving frustrating due to slow security and passport control inflicting long waits.,3
2240,"Not brilliantly signposted, and the entrance procedure was a little confusing. However, staff were extremely helpful and the transfer service was very good. Price was very decent as well.Would recommend.",4
2241,Not the cheapest but as close as you can get to terminal and no hassle.,4
2242,Overall good experience. Thanks.,5
2243,We usually use jet parks and this time used meet and greet. Made the experience of arriving and coming back so much easier knowing exactly where you parked your car and walking straight into departures and straight out arrivals. Definitely using this service every time now,5
2244,"Great experience except for going down to the lower terminal where cigarette smoke bellowed in from the smokers outside, that’s the only thing that lets it down",4
2245,"your service is excellent, the present state of terminal 2 i feel is making it difficult for you to offer the usual level of service",4
2246,An easy to use service that makes travelling a better experience,5
2247,I been for lots times in manchester airport car park but this last time no very good service from shuttle bus we arrive 7h30am can waiting i bus stop for half hour first bus come and not stop because is full take more 15 minutes next one arrive we have just in time do the check in. Not again in this carpark ringway carparpPaul,4
2248,"Good all round service, quick and efficient service.Would recommend to friends etc. I used Jet Parks 3 as per usual for parking.Found the whole area around the airport in turmoil and upheaval as development and alterations take place. A bit of a disappointment after having had a very good holiday to go here there and everywhere with hold ups!",4
2249,No problems.,4
2250,Current construction / engineering work is making access complicated but once inside the 'pound' it was easy to find a car park space and buses were reasonably timed.Recently publicised future 'drop off' charges are a sign that Manchester Airport has joined Rip Off Britain.,4
2251,Excellent service. Easy to use,5
2252,"Nearly there but still a few niggles, should improve when all the road works are completed. Service for late night / early morning arrivals needs to be improved to get 5 stars",4
2253,"This is an extremely busy airport.  On airport parking is very good if you pre-book.  There is registration recognition so the barriers go up as you arrive and leave, no need to take tickets.  The airport is clean.  It is a bit confusing if you come into the lower ground floor but there are escalators to get to upper ground where the majority of the check in desks are.  There are plenty of food outlets and shops to pick up last minute items.  Security is always busy, but the queue moves pretty quickly and the staff are very good at calling people through whose flight is imminent.  Once through security the duty free area is extensive and the staff are very helpful and friendly.  There are numerous shops and food outlets although the seating area can seem cramped when it is very full.",4
2254,"Excellent service at terminal one meet and greet, definitely the best way to go to and from Manchester airport, will certainly do it again",5
2255,"Price great experience,would use again",5
2256,Simple it works - Hassle free,5
2257,"Good offer price, right on the terminal which was ideal with young child.Easy to and from.Would recommend to anyone.",5
2258,"As always a good service, the only downside currently is the roadworks to T1 M&G which are a pain to navigate to and especially get back to the motorway from, hopefully they finish these soon",4
2259,"Great travel experience, security is good, duty free has a good choice. Overall experience was good.",5
2260,"Never in my life as frequent traveler through many British, European, American, Asian and African airports have I experienced such rude and incompetent security staff is in Manchester. What a poor PR for Manchester to treat visitors in such a manner.",1
2261,Really poor signage on leaving the airport.  Chaotic.,1
2262,"Under staffed border control, not enough seating in departures, poor standard of service throughout the airport. Rip off parking fees, and sky high food and drink prices. Avoid manchester airport if you can and don't want to waste half your time queuing. Liverpool John Lennon is a much better experience and value for money.",1
2263,"Terminal 1 multi-storey is odd due to the pedestrian access being different if you are on odd or even levels. You don't know this when parking, but makes a big difference on returning. Pick the Odd levels!",4
2264,"Easy to use, professional set up and right outside the airport doors.  Could use more consideration when parking cars ready for pick up, I'd about a foot between mine and the car next to us making it difficult to get in at the drivers side.",4
2265,"For cost, flexiblity, reliability and time-saving use Manchester Airport Parking.",4
2266,"Broken Dirty ToiletsQueues for EVERYTHING, even in the Priority QueCloth Shops in Airports WHAT IS THA ALL ABOUT!Unable to by certain duty free when travelling in EU, even when willing to pay the duty!Car Park just a muddy scrap of waste land!",1
2267,Access to T1 Short Stay car park is poor due to the 'drop-off' road using the same access,2
2268,Ended up walking to the car park as no bus. Meet and greet and multi storey not available.,2
2269,"The worst security process (for a big airport) in Europe, particularly when busy. Unused lanes with massive queues, makes no sense.Passport control is slower than any of the other airports I visit and there is always a massive queue. Two planes land at the same time and the airport can't cope.",3
2270,Terminal 1 is a bit dated and security can not handle volume of passengers,4
2271,Used long stay 1/3 and found it much better than my previous experience with Jetpark parking. At least this time my car number was recognised when entering and leaving. Plenty of spaces available although work on the car park meant the bus driver wouldn’t drop us near the car which was right next to a bus shelter.,4
2272,It is simply not worth using Manchester Airport car parks at this time. The bus services are appalling and run only when they feel like it and not to the stated timetable.,1
2273,"Great airport, what a relief for us in the north having so many long haul destinations available, all without having to go through the dreaded Heathrow.",5
2274,Always 1st class service received at T2 Meet & Greet - keep up the good work whilst in the thick of major works :-),5
2275,Overall good experience but the signage to find the car park (Jet Parks 1) in the first place was almost non-existent.  OK for subsequent visits but difficult for the first time use.,3
2276,BE WARY!! flight was cancelled on the day - they don't offer any form of refund.I pointed out that hotels charge for the 1st night/day if you cancel last minute. Little tight if this cancellation is out of your control.Had to pay for the whole parking dates - even though I'm not there - thats simply not a fair policy!,3
2277,Meet and Greet Parking is fast efficient and stress free.,5
2278,Road works causing chaos. No signage for the pre-booked car park resulted in parking elsewhere and paying again. Do not pre book.,1
2279,Car park automatic number plate recognition does not work and need to double the egates for return flights as que’s are too long,2
2280,"Multi storey so much easier, no need for a bus!",5
2281,"Excellent meet and greet set up . Check in experience hampered by large queue to check in skis ,",4
2282,Reduced rating due to impact of ongoing building alterations.,3
2283,"Easy to use (both on departures and arrivals), staff were friendly and when we came back to the UK and I had lost my ticket, they were still friendly and helped resolve matters quickly so that I could get my car and leave.",5
2284,Getting through security is still a slow process and staff can be a little bit short when replying to queries or directing you. Not everybody is  familiar with the process and can be nervous and unsure this can be reduced with a friendly response,4
2285,The construction works is making a visit to the airdrome very stressful  from what is normally an easy experience. Especially after a long flight and arriving in the dark.,5
2286,With number plate recognition and payment in advance it’s cheaper and really easy access in and out of the car park. Would recommend to anyone.,5
2287,"Manchester Airport is now too big, I prefer to use smaller Regional Airports.",3
2288,"Easy to park and find the car, friendly staff only be aware, check you car before and after you taking it back.  We found scratches on side of it ,when back to home ... make sure you check before you leave car park .",2
2289,good value efficient bus service BUT very limited collection and drop off points in t1/3 long stay car park due to building work (March 2018),4
2290,Customer service dives with plans to charge for dropping off passengers,3
2291,"Welcome to the Long wait  , this needs sorting out ASAP .It’s becoming a bit of a shambles , departing and arriving . Terminals are now too small and cannot cope with volume of people .",3
2292,Building work going on at the moment so expect disturbance. Car parks are over subscribed so get a taxi to save your stress.,2
2293,Worst Airport in Europe. A Disgrace to Great Britain.,1
2294,"Bit tricky to find if your not a regular user, it only means going round the block again if you miss it.ANPR lets you in & out easily, fills up very quickly you could go several floors before you find a space.Overall, right next door to the terminal, simples",4
2295,Jet 1 car park awful. Do not use.,3
2296,"The entrance to Manchester Airport is confusing chaotic and shambolic.The signage is inaccurate the roads are third rate ( reminding me of the roads in Africa)The Airport is cramped overcrowded and out of date. The security system needs to move into the 21st century, waiting over one hour to get through the security system !!!!",1
2297,A good experience. Would recommend to anyone,5
2298,Excellent service. Easy booking reasonable prices. Easy to find. Hassle free travel.to.the airport.,5
2299,"Apart from temporary building work causing us to walk further to available stop, excellent and efficient service received.",5
2300,"Excellent service, keep up the great work",5
2301,The airport is a disgrace .Road works security sighnage are well below the standards of many other airports I have visited.I have also learnt the Mancheste are going to demand more money from us the travelers by charging to drop people of.,1
2302,"Beware of overstay charges and to avoid, always book your parking in 24h blocks even if you don’t need it as they will charge you a significant overstay fee if your flight is delayed or cancelled due to their inability to handle snow.",1
2303,Return journey to Ringway park meant a 20 minute plus wait in the rain and cold. Bus missing? Otherwise everything worked smoothly.,3
2304,"Ok, but need to have better software to recognise reg no’s. And deal with congestion on exiting, too many people trying to pay at the exit barrier with cards leads to lengthy delays.",3
2305,"Airport off site car parking with bus transfer (Ringway car park).  The car park is fine but the busses just are not frequent enough and this compromises the overall service.  Also, I had pre-paid but when I put my token in to leave the car park the terminal demanded I pay £112 by credit card.  Fortunately, the person I spoke to the via the intercom was very helpful and opened the barrier.",2
2306,"Shambolic security, dirty lifts and other public areas.",1
2307,Multi story car park very close to terminal so very convenient.  Don;t have to walk outside so no worries about the weather.  Very reasonable charges especially if you can use a discount which arrives in your email frequently after you have used this facility once.,5
2308,Needs resurfacing and bus drivers that are not rude and arrive on time.,3
2309,"Manchester airport is too crowded. When I last travelled from terminal 1 there were large queues at all the food outlets and insufficient seating in the main part of the airport. The experience of security checks is poor compared to that of airports elsewhere. The area in which people wait for their luggage to come through security, especially after it has had to have extra checks is too small, crowded, confusing and stressful. It’s obvious that the airport runs at full capacity and is in need of a major upgrade. Perhaps it should look at Munich or Amsterdam as examples of airports which give a much more pleasant and stress free experience for travellers.",3
2310,Good airport to use particularly T2 and will be even better withe present update work,5
2311,Security checks a little slow....could be better.....arrive earlier than required,3
2312,"Slightly hard to find the parking due to road works - however arrival was smooth, just drove in no problems with number plate recognition or anything.  Got the bus fairly quickly. Return trip was awful. Bus driver was incredibly rude. We’d just come off a flight from Heathrow, after a flight from the states. We’d been travelling for 20 hours and awake for nearly 30 with no sleep. Very tired and a bit confused by the bus waiting area at terminal three (not very clearly marked) we saw a bus outside and went to ask the driver. I knew the number of our stop and which car park it was, I went to ask him if he was the right bus just to be sure - he started rolling his eyes and huffing at me - pointing up to the bus display name asking me if that was the same name as the car park I’d parked in and if it wasn’t to get off. He then said my stop number wasn’t on his route  and to wait for another bus - my partner was sure he was just being dismissive and not listening so we got on the bus anyway - lo and behold it was the correct one!  All the driver needed to do was be a bit kinder, I know he’s probably not enjoying Work and a bit bored but that’s no excuse to be so rude to customers.",3
2313,Good regional airport when compared across the world’s regional airports. Security checks slow and over thorough.,4
2314,"when we used the car park nearest the terminal , on our arrival to the car park when we had our holiday, we could not find our car, it was cold, wet and windy and took my husband 90mins to find our car and we only found it as we had to use the intercom ..we were then informed that it had been moved to a different zone !!!!! We should have been informed via email, thee really was no excuse.I emailed the airport with my complaint and as to date still waiting for a reply",3
2315,Let down this time by temporary nature of building works which caused a problem with parking. Also the new development where customers can not be picked up without an additional charge is most unwelcome regardless of whether other airports do this or not.,4
2316,"Airport experience good, but struggled with Ryanair baggage process",4
2317,Not exactly a benchmark airport in Europe,3
2318,"It should be a better experience, but it isn't.",2
2319,"Just niggly points let the experience down. Doesn't help that security staff are people other companies, and especially the police, would never ever consider employing.",4
2320,"Easy to use, not too time consuming",5
2321,"Just been to Cape Verde for a week and parked in T2 Multi storey, the cost was £64 which is fine because it would cost £50 return in a private hire taxi (plus the drop off charges ) so its comparable and I experienced no problems at all, but if I go for 10 days its in excess of £100 so it isn't cost effective because the taxi fare doesn't alter.",4
2322,"Travelled on Friday 16th March to Copenhagen, the experience reminded me why I normally travel from Birmingham. Even though I arrived over 2 hours before my flight, I reached the gate as the final call was being made as it had taken over 90 minutes to get through security and I was in the priority lane. No apparent reason for the wait, no organisation of the queue, only once have I experienced a longer wait.",1
2323,one hour wait for bags after the flight arrived at a gate around 100m away. no messages or esitmates,2
2324,Meet and greet provided an excellent service.,4
2325,Ok but even though pre-booked still had to fight for a space.,4
2326,Meet and greet service is fantastic with very friendly and helpful staff.,5
2327,dirtyexpensive parkingrip off taxis,1
2328,"The meet and greet experience of dropping the car off was excellent, however, picking it up was total rubbish. The car park was full of taxi's blocking the route out which meant it took us nearly 30 minutes to get out of the car park and when I complained about this they totally ignored my comments. Will never ever use a gain.",1
2329,"Easy, reliable and reasonable value.",5
2330,Hassle free very good facilities & service,5
2331,Excellent parking facilities.,4
2332,"My flight was cancelled due to bad weather, I had to return home. MAN airport would not consider a refund on my parking so 1 night parking cost me £119.99. The cruise company who's ship we were joining were fantastic in their customer relations and assisted me in a great way. MAN sent me a very curt note ""claim off your travel insurance"".",1
2333,"Shambles from start to finish nearly twenty minutes to get through security,automatic passport system wont always work, tired and dirty departure areas, this is terminal 1, have not flown from terminal 2 for a while but last time it was not much better, and now they want to charge three pounds for drop off from june 2018 come on Manchester Airport clean up your act.",2
2334,"Great place to fly from. Easy to get to, well signposted. Holiday starts here.",5
2335,Manchester Airport has got to find a quicker way to get through security waiting in line for on 1 1/2 hours is not good.,3
2336,Terminal 2 was very poorly  supported the facility was very limited at our time of travel (Friday afternoon) .The prices were very high when you know you have a captured public . TUI were not the best we were lied to and 19.5 hr delay was not a very good experience with limited facility open,3
2337,"No issues, everything worked out really well",5
2338,Smooth efficient service would use again,5
2339,Parking (JetParks 2) was appalling and departures (Terminal 1) was atrocious.  Arrivals (Terminal 1) was OK but by then I had decided that I would never use Manchester again if it can be avoided (and there are plenty of better alternatives).,1
2340,"The best way of parking at the airport. Safe and secure, love it.",5
2341,Simplest way to get in and out of airport,4
2342,Easy to negotiate your way through. Good range of shops and places to eat,5
2343,"Mainly trouble free experience , usual short delay at baggage collection point.",4
2344,Overall it was alright but small niggles occurred in the whole departure and arrival process.,3
2345,I found the meet and greet facilities at terminal 2 a pleasant experience and will use later this month (March) and July 2018,5
2346,Tired airport but lots quieter than Heathrow etc,4
2347,5 star to Manchester airport very good service,5
2348,"The security area staff in T2 are rude, aggressive and unhelpful. Management doesn't care and the travelling public suffer humiliation, aggression and contempt from these people.",1
2349,Whilst the roadworks are ongoing try and park elsewhere it is very frustrating,3
2350,"Great drive in / drive out number plate recognition with pre-booking but still make sure you allow plenty of time to find a space, it gets pretty full up!",4
2351,"Great, made it much easier to travel on my own",5
2352,Airport ok but huge car park overcharging when flight delayed,2
2353,"Easy to find, convenient",5
2354,"Great, easy to use right by the terminal. Always plenty of parking on the top deck",5
2355,"Not a great experience , hopefully it will be better after the building programme is completed but that's many years into the future",2
2356,"Not much to complain about, although when you visit other airports you can see how better things could be. Amsterdam Schiphol airport is s great example.",4
2357,"Paid for a platinum valet. The car as dirtier than when I left it, had damage to the body and had extra mileage on it. Complaints have been ignored!",1
2358,Booked myself into long stay car park as I don't trust meet and greet to look after the car properly. Upon my return (2 weeks later) at 6am in the morning I found my car was no longer where I had left it. After some considerable time I found a member of staff who explained it might have been moved due to building work (as in lifted onto a lorry and driven somewhere else) - it was about 500M away from where I left it. It would be a good idea if they need to do this then they need to let the customer know to avoid panic when they return to the car park !,3
2359,"Very functional and easy to get around. Nit the prettiest place, but service is good.",4
2360,"For such a large airport with thousands of travellers, experience fairly quick and hassle free.",4
2361,"Booked a gold valet from meet and greet carpark- extremely disappointed with the resultsHadnt vacuumed  the front foot wells, hadn't wiped the dashboard, left a can of spray in the baby seat, no air freshener left",3
2362,Security area very small and hot even in March!,3
2363,"Great airport, clean, tidy and easy to use especially with meet and greet parking.",4
2364,3 hours to get through security. Never again.,2
2365,Terminal 1 is better than 2 as its much closer. Good value if you get discounted down to £50 for a week but too expensive to use for two weeks,3
2366,"Manchester Airport is a very large, busy airport and well organised with excellent facilities, though it can be some distance to your flight departure or arrival area.",4
2367,"Good now, should be even better when improvements completed.",4
2368,Bit pricey but still cheaper than the to & fro taxi. Signs to the Terminal 2 car park were not clearly visible. Shuttle service was good and on time.,4
2369,"First class service from star to finish, the only slight problem was the roadworks around the Airport which of course you have no control over.",5
2370,Travelled for business to Stuttgart last week. Chose to park the car at the airport to avoid booking a taxi.  Parking price was the same for Meet and Greet at T3 as it was for the multi-storey.  This is the second time I have used Meet and Greet and have been extremely satisfied on both occasions.Staff very friendly and helpful and the whole experience is stress free.Got fast track through security as part of the booking.  Sat in the departure lounge having a coffee in no time.  The whole airport experience was a pleasant one.,5
2371,Great drop off and pick up location for easy access to terminal 1. New technology now seems to be working better and so no hold ups with auto number plate reader on entry on this occasion. Staff and process efficient and easy to find car on return. Definitely recommend this service.,4
2372,"Manchester airport is pokey and looks tired. I fly into most major EU international airports on a weekly basis. I am proud of my city but the airport as an entrance to it for many is poor, Copy Munich, bright, airy, clean. We can do the same for GB's second city.",2
2373,Car park experience not good with building works and no bus service round car park for term 1/3,3
2374,It’s reassuring to know that your car is in a safe place while you are away so you can relax and enjoy your holiday,5
2375,Good service and friendly staff however queues at security can occasionally be on the long side. Fast Pass recommended. Great range of destinations meaning as a regular traveller I don't have to drive down to London airports,5
2376,"Parking car in multi story is not easy, never any spaces availableSecurity check outbound is very slowimmigration control very slow on arrival, took over 1 hour to clear even as a UK citizen",3
2377,Make sure you know where you are going before you get there.,4
2378,"the airport itself is generally well-organised but the roadworks around it create some difficulties, particularly as far as signposting is concerned.",3
2379,"I parked at Manchester long term car park for a month, on my return was physically moved to another area. I was not informed as to where to find my car despite the car park having my contact details. I had to walk down the rows to find it. Also my car had scratches and digs to the paintwork on doors. Very poor.",2
2380,Meet and greet is smooth and easy. Multi check ins makes ease of checking luggage in much quicker. Shops & retail excellent in terminal 1,5
2381,A well run facility easy to use and I have never had a problem when I return to my car its always in great condition when I pack it up,5
2382,"Manchester Airport Rubbish Again. This time, immigration officers insult passengers who pay for the fast track service. Yes, we know it's a paid-for queue jump - but if the normal queues moved faster, we wouldn't need it. But there is no need for the border force officer last Wednesday to comment  that we shouldn't complain when there is nobody at Fast Track as ""it's only 3 quid"" so ""go and join the slow queue"". I kid you not!!Maybe some training in manners for the border force people....",1
2383,"A very poorly signposted car park, drivers who don’t know how to use the cars they move between where you leave the car and where you collect it from,    I will never use this service again,",1
2384,"Dated airport and not currently fit for purpose, terminal 3 is cramped, dark and the selection of food places and general shopping is awful. Please build a new terminal and quickly that is fit for purpose and takes into account the security measures we now have to go through. I used to quite enjoy flying, now it feels like an ordeal that you just want to get through.",2
2385,I think this is the easiest parking I have had no problem with the spaces and no issues with the bus,4
2386,"ease of parking car, friendliness and proffesionalism of staff",5
2387,"We travelled to the airport on 7 March in good time for our check in but were met with extensive road works at the airport which mean't that we spent over an hour trying to get to Jet Park 3 (including filtering back onto the M53).We did not see anything on the airport website regarding the road works and alternative route signage to the car park was non existent.When we eventually got to the car park, the number plate recognition cameras were not working and we spent around 15 minutes trying to get in before we could park the car.This left us late for check in and literally left us 10 minutes to get to our gate for boarding.However, there were another couple who had had the same experience as us but when they eventually got to the car park, they had 20 minutes to check in for their flight to Cuba - don't think somehow they will have made it.",1
2388,The car park is so easy to book online and incredibly easy to access. It is so close to the terminal that you can walk in if you want to but the bus service is free and frequent. We have used it many times as we often stay overnight before our flights at the Holiday Inn or the Clayton Hotel and these are both an easy walk from the car park which makes it absolutely ideal.,5
2389,"jetparks 3 great pricing off peak, tends to get expensive when the kids are off school.  Meet and greet T1 is fast and reasonable priced.",4
2390,"Not a Meet and Greet ServiceAt terminal 2 Manchester Airport you are far better parking in the high rise car park and not using meet and greet. The meet and greet service starts with leaving your car in a car park at the far end of the multi-storey car park, where you could have parked. You are not met, you are directed where to park. The location of this car park, and the office where you leave your keys, means a longer walk to departures than if you use the standard car park. On arrival back you have to walk from arrivals past the multi storey car park, where your car has been moved to, and collect your keys from the office. all this while pulling and carrying your luggage. Then walk back to the car park to your car. If you use the multi storey car park you walk straight out of arrivals to the car park, a much easier distance.In the literature you receive after parking they recommend on returning from your journey that one of your party stays with your car and luggage while another goes for the car keys. But until you get to the office you don't know where your car is parked. Meet and greet, in my opinion, should be a service where you are met by someone close to the departures entrance and they park your car. On arrival back you should be greeted with your car and your car keys in a position close to the arrivals exit. Neither of these happen. There is no reason to call this service meet and greet. It is car parking and offers less benefits than simply parking your car in the multi-storey car park. I will not be using this service again.",1
2391,Okay parking once you found carpark very poor signage and very dark at the entrance no digns gor bus so we walked whuch was quicker due to the traffuc,2
2392,Very good experience every time we fly from Manchester Airport,5
2393,Manchester is one of the best airports we've flown from anywhere in the world and would definitely recommend to anyone,5
2394,"A poor start and finish to a once in a lifetime holiday owing to the complete mismanagement and customer unfriendly approach of Terminal Two car park.   What an appalling mess of a car park with inadequate signage on approach through road works, no consideration for customer convenience whilst various disruptive dubious changes are in progress! Waited over twenty minuets for bus in freezing conditions after ten minuets walk with heavy cases from car.  On return a nightmare to get out!  Tried several barriers that would not open on the approach,  it took nearly half an hour to get out after in complete despair contacting the control center.",2
2395,"Very quick and easy, both arriving and departing.    I would use Meet & Greet every time.",5
2396,Really good parking. With small walk to terminal building.,5
2397,Always good and helpful staff If you need them.airport needs updatingplease complete the roadworks !,3
2398,"40 minutes in the car park of drive ng around looking fir a space. We had pre booked so presumed their would be a space, lots of people driving around for over 30 minutes looking for spaces but it was full. We al a,most missed our flight because of this!",1
2399,Good value for money but some areas need resurfacing,4
2400,"T3 customs staff very unfriendly, not many shops and lounge not as well equipped as the other terminals",4
2401,Good except security need more people checking scanned stuff,4
2402,"Reasonably well run airport. It is medium-sized, which makes it easier to use than Heathrow or Gatwick.",4
2403,Expensive...but very near to Terminal.3,4
2404,"A great airport with good food options, good car parking and fast access through security to departures.",5
2405,Have always used Meet & Greet at terminal 2 3-4 times a year. Am looking to book again for June but price has escalated so much it is now cheaper to take a  taxi.,4
2406,"Hope in time MIA gets the improvements it needs, lots of Dept need up dating.",3
2407,Very easy to book and easy to find over all would recommend to everyone who flying from Manchester Airport.,5
2408,Good clear questions no jargon quick ad easy to do,5
2409,Chaotic departure area with queues into the food and circulation area and not enough info boards.  Building works ever where (march 2018) don't help with finding some of the parking.  No warning of this when booking,3
2410,Excellent service excellent staff that are friendly and informative. So easy from arrival to picking up the car. I will always use this service now,5
2411,"Excellent service,efficient problem free  . Reasonably priced. Friendly staff. Quick getaway from airport after flight as service close by.",5
2412,I have used the Car Parks many times.  On this occasion your arrival instructions did not quite give the directions needed;  however owing to the sizeable road works on approach this was probably not your fault.  It might be worth your having a look at this - depending on how long the road works are going to be in place.,4
2413,"Good airport, ease of use.",4
2414,"Departures is fine, security can take a long time but arrivals is worse it takes ages to get through passport control.",3
2415,Only problem was road works approaching the car park otherwise no problem at the airport,5
2416,"Meet & greet car park, fast track passport all ok! Would recommend +A+",5
2417,Not the easiest airport to find your car parks and the security was just chaos with not enough staff to check you through.,3
2418,"The Car parking was great, departure areas OK but priority lounges were full - this was the 2nd time in 2 months. Security is terrible especially the ground floor of terminal one, long queues rude staff.",3
2419,"Airport is great, clean, and warm.  The staff are friendly and efficient",5
2420,I frequently (monthly) fly through Manchester and find the whole UK Border and eGate process to be appalling. The Border staff are sullen and rude. A polite and appropriate “Good Morning” is usually met with a grunt. They do not represent the professionalism I see at other European destinations. eGate staff routinely shout at and bully passengers about which way to place passports and them blame them when the eGate does not work. The technology is clearly not developed or mature enough so that everyone can use it simply and efficiently. The public should not need to have training to use an eGate - it should just work!,2
2421,Extremely poor customer service following an issue with parking. Almost impossible to talk to a representative on the phone,1
2422,apart from the 13th floor of the multi storey carpark and queueing in departure xray which i fully expect at certain times i was happy with all other aspects of the airport,4
2423,I have used these car parks many times and not a problem but at the moment with the major road works at the airport it’s not as easy when you’re the only one in the car trying to read the signs and navigate through road works.,4
2424,Manchester Airport is a pleasure to fly from . Facilities are excellent .,5
2425,"Very helpful and friendly staff, an efficient service which I would definitely use it again when flying from Manchester airport.  Booking online was easy,, and I would recommend this service.",5
2426,"Good experience with car parking from the on line booking , the communications and the experience.",4
2427,Car parking experience is always good with jet parking bus service fast and easy to terminals airport satisfactory could do better with easier security checkpoints overall always have been pleased with the service,4
2428,We have been using Manchester’s Terminal 3 since the late 70’s and have seen little improvements during this time in spite of greatly increased passenger numbers. The facility is a very poor second when compared to European equivalents. It is inadequate for the passengers using it.,2
2429,Everything was really good and acceptable. Easy to use on line booking firm. Prices acceptable. Really easy to find car park and bus service to airport was really good and driver polite and friendly. Airport clean and tidy and getting checked in and going through passport control was done as quickly and safely as possible.,4
2430,Had a treat start to a week skiing with friends,5
2431,"This airport needs to improve its service/ provision for people with mobility problems, there seems to be a lack of staff employed to push the wheel chair users through the airport.",3
2432,During renovations at terminal 2 sign posting could be improved. The signage wad not good and I missed the sign for T2 M&G and had to go back on the motorway before I could get back. Not good!,4
2433,Always enjoy flying out of Manchester we even drive from north of Glasgow to do it.Meet and greet we'll worth it and hassle free,5
2434,"Fab service, easy and painless",5
2435,"Location convenient. Car parking good. Range of destinations good. Security often slow and not very friendly. On our return our ""priority baggage"" was almost the last out after a long wait for any baggage to appear.",3
2436,Passport control experience needs to improve and become more slicker,4
2437,dirty terminal 3. carpark no help with disabled parking direction.checkin for disabled not good. security  and bag check disgusting ignorant staff. bags left on the security belt no explaination . on the whole a bad experience. i will not be using terminal 3 again. staff need retraining on politness and tolerance of people,1
2438,Overall good experience,5
2439,"Really easy to use, great staff who were all friendly and helpful.",5
2440,On arrivals Uk border force very rubbish service got told by a chief that they haven’t got staff when they know they are getting more that 10 flights that day not acceptable,3
2441,Will be a lot better when building work is completel.,4
2442,"Fast track a joke, security held for an hour behind lots of other people staff working to rule? Security checkers taking 10 minutes to swan a bag then go through every item and ask stupid questions and even more stupid comments such as’ the machine didn’t like your handbag having more weight at one end’ it may be that you security stood the handbag on its end? Then for them to say they didn’t like it was a bit heavier! Total  idiots perhaps they were running late for school as he appeared to be about 15. There is security and there is just being arses",2
2443,"Long stay car park a mess, Not impressed with the bays or surface condition. Price however is fair",2
2444,"Improve the signs for long term car parks and hurry up with the roadworks, the entrance is a shambles.",3
2445,Very good except return bus for jet parks2,4
2446,"Great experience from start to finish, friendly and professional staff, easy to find entrance, no problems with car registration recognition, easy to park, short walk to reception, short walk to terminal.  On return, car was ready and waiting, fair price for service, would recommend",5
2447,"The initial pickup from the carpark wasn't good. It was not obvious to me where the bus pickup was, or there aren't enough pickup points. Coming back it was very straight forward.",4
2448,Easiest way to get to the airport. No taxi costs and no delays,5
2449,Great Service Ticketless entry and exit make things a lot quicker,5
2450,"Meet and greet service at T1 was very handy and convenient. Would definitely recommend and use again. Just drive up and hand keys in at recpetion, so easy and staff are polite.",5
2451,Be aware that instructions and signage  for jet parks three during roadworks   is poor and erratic so leave extra time.,4
2452,Great - when roadworks are complete it will be excellent.,4
2453,Due to building works taking place the road system makes it hard to follow signs to the car parks.,4
2454,"Do not use meet and greet car parking under any circumstances. When they damage your car you suddenly find out how many others they have done the same to & the tactics they use to not fix it, despite admitting it happened in their care.",1
2455,"unpleasant experience – at the security: long queues, the waiting areas are cramped, poor food. Where are the pizzerias, Thai food etc.?",2
2456,"Security control was disorganised, staff were somewhat unprofessional and because passengers were being sent to 2 scanner isles where only one scanner was working a significant queue built up, bag checks were delayed and passengers were getting frustrated. The staff eventually picked up on this and asked for another member of staff, but when she arrived she immediately engaged with another member of staff in a personal conversation, causing more frustration for passengers. Staff also overheard commenting on some passengers for not removing watches, belts etc. I have had better experiences going through Manchester Airport and to be fair have had few problems.",3
2457,My car was vandalised quite badly - beware!!!,1
2458,Trouble free start and finish to our holidays - we only like 10 miles from the airport but the great service and experience means we wouldn't do anything else.,5
2459,"Good value , will use again",5
2460,Massive queues for the car park.Massive queues for check-in.Ridiculous queues for oversize baggage.Massive queues for security.Massive queues for passport control on return.Ridiculously long wait for baggage.,2
2461,Very smooth check-in and departure experience,5
2462,Signposting to the T3 Short Stay could be better,4
2463,SECURITY CONTROL AT DEPARTURES IS A SHAMBLES SOMEONE SHOULD CHECK ALICANTI AIRPORT TO SEE HOW IT SHOULD BE DONE.,2
2464,"Easy access to Terminal 3, the The parking bays are nice and wide.The free bus arrives every 10 minutes,  but you could walk to the terminal  within 5 minutes if you choose . The price is good for parking so close to the Airport.",5
2465,Before you go - use the Manchester Airport website.Their are excellent videos showing the drive from the motorway through to wherever your car drop off is.Although thedrop off pick up for terminal 3 at street level is a bit hectic it works and is free.You can also use the T1 drop off that is a bit more civilised.and free.Both these are purely for drop off though - with no waiting time.We used the Meet and Greet parking this time.A little expensive but cheaper than taxi or train for a short trip and no hassle.,4
2466,Manchester is a great airport to fly into and out of.,5
2467,So convenient and usually cost effective as well.,5
2468,I always find Manchester Airport staff friendly and helpful but I do feel terminal 1 needs cleaning.,4
2469,"Overall experience was good. Entry and exit was so simple , bus to and from airport was simple and frequent . Only downside (jp2) is that where the car is parked isn't tarmacked so if it has been a wet day it's muddy",4
2470,no complaints everything was as they said 2nd time we have used them mike w prestwich,5
2471,"Easy enough to navigate round , passport control a fair wait on way back",4
2472,"Hard to fault.I use MAN at least monthly, if not more frequently, and always find it as good an experience as an airport can be.",5
2473,Terminal 3 Manchester airport Meet and Greet an effortless and low hassle experience. Well worth it,5
2474,Overall very good but security procedures could be speedier,4
2475,"Hate this airport mainly for huge long queues in security and only having half the inspection stations open. Totally pathetic. Allow a whole hour to queue then get pulled out as your plane is leaving - stressful, tiring and no way to start a holiday.Not a one-off experience, Terminal One always like this. Manchester Airport YOU SUCK",1
2476,Easy to use all terminals. Good connection.,5
2477,Great service and simple drop off and collection,5
2478,don't use jet parks was left 55 mins for bus in freezing temp when bus came was to full to pick us up and had to walk to otherside of car park to a bus stop at the beginning of the car park to make sure we got on and it was a good job we went early as the other couple who was also waiting had less time about an hour to catch there flight,1
2479,Good all round experience.,5
2480,"Terrible experience last Friday morning, meeting daughter's flight arriving at 07:00. Short stay car park was very busy but got a space on an upper level (C). Quick turnaround so hoping to make it out within 1/2 hour for a £4 charge (or it would be £6+ for up to 1 hour), but could we see a pay machine? Was there any signs informing you where the pay machines are? Nothing, nobody around to ask, so rather than returning to the terminal to find a human, we risked driving to the exit. This is obviously a very common issue because the 'refuge' areas to park in if you haven't already paid were chocka-block, it was a free for all - plenty of exit barriers but several drivers unable to approach said barriers as they'd not paid. Again we couldn't see any signs pointing out the pay machines, I found one near the exit barriers but there was no signage and because a van was parked in front of it it was hidden - suggest an overhead sign (with flashing lights??). More signs and perhaps pay machines near the lifts? It was early so maybe I was blinkered to the signs???",2
2481,"car parking gets 5 stars but security control the worst ever and sadly this is every time I use Manchester Airport which over the past 12 months has been 10+ times,staff in security are rude uncaring difficult and think they are above anything near to a good service.Given a choice I would never use Manchester Airport with all its plus points the same problems with security staff far outweigh everything else",1
2482,"It’s not geared towards the business traveller. Great idea to introduce fast track security and passport control, but lines shared with pay as you go upgraders.  As a frequent traveller, passing through the airport weekly, the priority privilege gives back family time.  I’d like to see dedicated priority lines eg for Star Alliance G and business class.Same applies to lounges. On my last visit used the Aspire lounge at 5.30am, and the serenity was removed by inconsiderate ‘holiday pay to enter’ guests with Bluetooth speakers, drinking heavily.",2
2483,Excellent service would definitely recommend this service to anyone,5
2484,"Unfortunately Manchester airport has been left to deteriorate while investment has been made in other airport worldwide. This is really evident when returning from overseas. Manchester airport is untidy, dirty and overcrowded in many areas. It seems no investments have been made in the airport terminals for many years, such a shame for such a great city.",1
2485,"High risk of car damage when parking, terribly slow and unorganised security and passport control areas",1
2486,Manchester airport could be improved greatly if the management was thinking more to the needs of the airport users.- Better waiting areas  - No need to purchase fast track every time to avoid long queues - More frequent bus journeys for long term car parks- better drop off zones and pick up zones for car to park for 1/2 hour- playarea for children in departure lounge - better lounge system ( most times lounge are overbooked) I travelled all over the world and never booked a lounge only in Manchester!!,3
2487,Very  good  experience made me feel  secure  that our car was looked after in a professional  way.,5
2488,"Car park is adequate, but signage is poor.  Concern that the number of parking spaces seems to be reducing.The experience of security and passport control for both departures and arrivals is awful.",3
2489,Always has available parking and minimal queue at passport control due to automatic passport readers. Does lack choice and comfort of seating at departues though.,4
2490,"Security is a nightmare, not enough facilities for the number of passengers. Baggage collection is always slow as is the wait at passport control on re entry. The Spanish seem to have it right why week we have all eyes problems in the uk",3
2491,"Always had a good experience at Manchester airport , however, on arrival this time, the park was fully booked...yet I'd pre-booked my slot in advance. Don't understand how the park can be full if you pre-book a slot.",3
2492,"A good airport, modern and with good facilities.  However I finfd the security process a rdiculous nonsense albeit not Manchesters fault and believe if spending 3 hrs plus in a airport, a basic wifi level should now be a free service.",4
2493,"Great experience, easy from start to finish. So convenient having your car at the airport instead of having to rely upon either taxi service or public transport.",5
2494,"WE booked the car park online prior to our flight to Krakow £64.99 but on our return we were made to pay another £62!  The following day we spoke to someone at Manchester Airport and they told us to gill a form  out online and someone would contact us to discuss the situation.  they blamed the adverse weather for the machine not recognising our registration number and us being charged again. This all happened 7 days ago, we still haven't heard anything.",3
2495,"The handling of wheelchair user was excellent at departure, but on arrival we were left without help to exit from the carousel, with luggage, to the bus.  We were able to get the help by asking a passing OCS person, to whom many thanks.",4
2496,Car parking super easy to use. JET PARK RINGWAY.,5
2497,100% stress free.,5
2498,Convenient for departure and arrival and number plate recognition ensures a speedy entry and ext,5
2499,Its a car park that is easy and convenient to use - there are cheaper alternatives but none that I am comfortable with.,4
2500,Excellent car parking and treatment - just need Manchester Airport to sort out the roadworks,4
2501,"T3 too small for the passenger numbers  , all loos in T3 and T1  too small and never feel really clean . T3 lacks enough eating facilities and seating In general though the airport is very convenient in terms travel to and from by car",3
2502,"The re-development is making it an issue to find what you need to fine and adding to the stress levels of late arrival.Traffic Marshalls and others had no idea where to fine thing and just said it was down to the works being done, not very helpful.Once in the building things were better but still room for improvement.",4
2503,"Only a couple of niggles this time, 75 minutes to get through security, and the parking lights of our car where left on when we collected our car from T1 M&G",4
2504,"Overall easy, bit weird that the pre-booked price was higher than booking on the day, but they were helpful with a mistake I made in the booking so can't complain",4
2505,Very good as always,5
2506,"Everything as described, Easy to park, friendly helpful staff on arrival and departure.",5
2507,EXCELLENT SERVICE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,5
2508,"Experience of car parking & airport of the highest order, well done 🤗",5
2509,"The only thing that lets down the parking experience is the poor surface on Jet Park 1. It is very muddy in places with dirty pools of water which then gets on shoes, luggage and the inside of the transfer buses. I guess this will be remedied in time given that this is a relatively new parking area but to my mind it should be addressed as a matter of urgency to improve the overall experience.",3
2510,Dark and grubby car park inadequate for modern cars. Rude and vindictive staff in security the like of which I never experienced in 80 airport checks last year alone,1
2511,Excellent service dropped car of right outside departure gate and car was waiting right outside arrivals  when I returned brilliant and well organised service will definetly use again and would recommend to anyone,5
2512,Parking was well signposted. Easy drop off/collection. Seconds to the terminal. highly recommended.,5
2513,"Can't change car park booking online if 24 hours before and the customer service desk closes at 5pm... why in an airport I don't know???   Online changes can't be done. So if something goes wrong you're screwed. Plus the airport is small, full of typical rough people going to Ibiza and just generally staff are miserable. The airport is badly managed.",1
2514,"Great location and easy walking distance to terminal 3 good sized parking spaces with room to open doors comfortablyEasy entrance and exit however must watch out for the prepaid sign to ensure you park in the correct area, the entrance was not clear that I had to wait for my registration to be recognised instead of collecting a token, on exit it was asking for a payment. However this was quickly resolved with the gentlemen on the help button thank you",5
2515,Arrivals greatly improved. Departures have a problem with checking in items such as golf clubs. I understand a new system was being rolled out and hope this will improve once bedded in.,4
2516,good service all round,5
2517,Good friendly airport. My first choice,4
2518,"The worst managed airport in the world. A disgraceful place. Why is the security check in the cellar? Why is it so dark, dirty, cluttered and depressing? Why is it so slow and why does nothing work?",1
2519,"Not the stressful experience some airports can be. Clean, well sign posted, plenty of people to assist you",4
2520,Long wait for Jet Parks 1 transfer bus and issue with licence plate recognition cameras on exiting.,3
2521,The appalling queues to pass through security in T1 are enough to make you take all steps to avoid Manchester Airport.,2
2522,We'd booked carparking in advance. On the day we were unable to travel to the airport by car because of the snow which closed all transpennine routes. I have requested a refund by nobody has bothered to reply to me.,1
2523,it very good and so close to the terminal and convenient. no hassle. great,5
2524,Easy to use - close to terminal,5
2525,Love this airport......the best in the UK,4
2526,Brilliant airport and fantastic for parking,5
2527,"The transfer between the jetpark and airport is wholly mis-stated.  It is more like 20-25 mins.  The passport control for arrivals seems to be getting worse and worse, especially if more than one arrival takes place.",3
2528,"The airport itself was fine it’s the car parking that created an overall bad lasting impression. I booked the carpark and put the postcode provided in the booking confirmation email into my satnav. I park, go on my holiday, then try to leave the carpark only to be told I can’t leave until I pay £70 more than the £67 I’d already paid. Turns out the postcode THEY PROVIDED is wrong, causing me to park in the wrong place without realising, yet I had to pay and now have to go through a lengthy appeals process to try and get it back. There’s no guarantee I’ll see that money again. Shocking they can get away with doing that to customers.",2
2529,"fabulous service at terminal 1 meet and greet, fast efficient drop off and pick up.  Will definitely use again",5
2530,Friendly and helpful staff. Easy to get to. Good facilities,5
2531,"Great car parking experience in the short stay T1 car park, incredibly convenient for the airport terminal, the lift takes you straight there. License recognition coupled with the company knowing your flight details, meant that although I was delayed, there was no issue at all. I also had to change the dates of travel prior to departure, and there was not problem with amending the booking at all, an excellent easy to use feature!",5
2532,Good location and very convenient to travel from,4
2533,"A comfortable start to my holiday, nice to begin the relaxation by handing over my car keys at meet and greet and strolling into a great airport.",5
2534,"Flight was cancelled and due to it 'being out of the airports control' no refund at all was offered for the unused parking. Parking was understayed by 3 days, if it was overstayed by the same I can bet that extra money for that would have been required. Even if that was 'out of my control'",1
2535,I avoid flying from Manch3ster if possible. The car park bus service is poor and queues at security and immigration far too long.,3
2536,"Manchester airport is, without doubt, one of the least organized and run down airports I have used. Most European airports put Manchester to shame. It is an embarrassment to the country.",1
2537,"It’s ok going out but be aware of disorganised, lengthy & humiliating passport control on return!",3
2538,Disgusting mess of litter and road works. Passport control an embarrassing chaotic welcome back.,2
2539,"I fly from here a few times a year and have never had a bad experience. Clean, tidy, everything clearly sign posted, friendly staff. And the Meet and Greet parking is well worth the money to take the hassle out of finding somewhere to park.",5
2540,"I recommend the the Meet and Greet service, they were very helpful when I booked the service for the wrong terminal.",5
2541,Got charged extra £36 as I parked in the wrong car park as signs aren’t great,3
2542,"My car was broken into in long stay T1 , T3 last week - Feb 18. The back window was completly smashed for the entire week that I was away. The customers paying for this car park should be made aware that it is not secure.",1
2543,"To Much building work with not enough signage to meet and greet, and very little scope for mistakes without massive disruption to departure timescale while navigating all the cones.",3
2544,"When I went to leave the car park, the barrier said I owed £15 when I had pre-booked. I pressed the support phone and was told that I had to pay this, before the line went quiet. I then called back and the same person rudely said ""is it you again?"". I wanted to find out why I was being charged when I booked to 8PM, and it was 7:55PM. The same person rudely said this was my fault for booking until 8AM on the website, before letting me through with no notice.",1
2545,Construction work at Terminal 2 is causing considerable disruption and makes finding the long stay car park more difficult than normal.,3
2546,Security queue too long and too slowLong time waiting for my bag after landing,3
2547,"EXCELLENT AIRPORT, STAFF VERY FRIENDLY, AND LOOKING FORWARD TO MY NEXT HOLIDAY GOING FROM THIS AIRPORT AND USING THEIR FACILITIES!!",5
2548,On this occasion we had a lunch time flight so things were not as chaoticas usual. Good experience. Return flight was delayed so it was after midnight when we returned. Never had it easier though passport control.,4
2549,"Parking is dreadful at Manchester Airport - the bays are ridiculously small, difficult to locate, and the multi-storeys dark, wet and cramped. It is also very expensive. Departure through security is a nightmare - slow and painful - even in fastrack. Departure lounge area is cramped and way out of date. Arrivals is a nightmare if you come off big plane such as an A-380. Corridors are tiny, and there is a crush when arriving at immigration. The wait can be severe. Toilet facilities are pathetic and cramped. Baggage retrieval area is dreadful - and process very slow. Use another airport if you can!",1
2550,Faultless service,5
2551,"Excellent meet and greet, efficient and friendly airport and staff.",4
2552,"Good when it goes right - if anything goes wrong then they hide behind the small print of the contract to avoid any responsibility.If using Meet & Greet parking remember to book a full AA vehicle inspection on return as no damage or issues will be taken into consideration after you leave the facility, even if these would be impossible to identify at the facility.",1
2553,"Really easy to find, dropped car off short walk to reception, dropped keys off then one minute to T3, will definitely use again",5
2554,"I'll never park any other way. So easy, so quick, so simple and not even that much more expensive.",5
2555,Manchester Airport is the most hassle-free of all the airports I fly from. Meet and Greet car parking often has good deals and comes highly recommended. Security staff are polite and the screening process very efficient,4
2556,"Excellent airport, friendly staff.",5
2557,Great service very close to terminals and clearly signposted especially with the current update of access roads,5
2558,easy to find Great car park good bus service to and from car park to airport.,5
2559,"Great access for North West travellers. Airport facilities are very good. Would have given Manchester Airport a 5 but let down by (some) over officious staff in the security area, again.",4
2560,First time user of airport parking facility. Absolutely no issues from arrival until return two weeks later. Would certainly recommend and certainly use again.,5
2561,Simple!e booking process and a good price.,5
2562,Very easy to use and convenient location.,5
2563,"I think the airport is generally overrated with average food outlets that charge the earth and duty free shops that are more expensive than the high street.  It used to be the start of my holiday browsing all the shops but I never look in them now.  I would also like to see the travelaters working in arrivals as we always seem to get the gate furthest away from passport control, as l have a lung condition l can hardly breathe from walking so far.",3
2564,"Great parking service to use.  Using the meet and greet parking at Manchester makes the start and end to any holiday soooo easy!!  You don't have wait for a transfer bus and or drag suitcases onto it, whilst keeping an eye on family.  Drive in park up, drop keys and catch your plane.  Return home, collect key and off you go!!!! Great service!!",5
2565,Love the ease of parking at the airport meet and greet - would highly recommend.,5
2566,The T1 and T3 carport are easy to access and quick on return to U.K.,5
2567,"This is the second occasion we used meet and greet, our first time was by our own booking mistake however we found the experience and service to be excellent and will choose meet and greet parking for all future Holidays.Well worth 5 stars",5
2568,"Manchester Airport has become my least favourite airport to travel from, it feels very cramped, the food halls are not great, passing through security is just seems a lot more hassle than other airports. Parking at Jetparks is an experience, it's basically a field, I'm not sure how much security there is and the buses can be a little infrequent. I try to fly from Leeds or Doncaster whenever possible",3
2569,The Multi Storey Car Parks are more expensive to use but enable you to arrive / leave faster than taking the usual car park buses,5
2570,Car park easy to find. Bus service and personnel are excellent,5
2571,"Expensive as all airport parking is, but you certainly get value for money. Easy, simple & very close to terminal makes journeys more relaxed.",5
2572,"Easy to find, helpful staff.",5
2573,Pre-booking the Car Park if using the car park for long / short stay is a must and Manchester Airport's official website is so simple and quick to use.,5
2574,"Terminal 3 is not a good space to spend time in.  Not enough eating or sitting places, especially when very busy.  Why aren’t all check in security staff trained the same way?  My husband told to take off his watch, I wasn’t. Both had trainer type shoes on. I was asked to take mine off, he wasn’t.  I was in a different queue so advice given by two separate people.",3
2575,From entering the car park to dropping the car of was exceedingly easy and I would recommend it to anyone.,5
2576,"Poor , car parking meet and greet paid for valet , no valet , no response to complaints and compared to other airports security and baggage seem to take an age",2
2577,"Very good experience from start to finish, thank you",5
2578,Car park charged us extra when we were stuck in Ireland from cancelled flight from bad weather.,2
2579,It was a simple and efficient method of leaving our car.,4
2580,FREQUENCY OF BUSES - VERY SLOW AND WHEN DID ARRIVE OFTEN FULL AND DID NOT STOP.DRIVERS UNFRIENDLY AND UNHELPFUL,2
2581,The Meet and Greet car park is not convenient at the moment due to the ongoing building work.,3
2582,"Terrible delay checking in bags - x1 machine out of action. Examples of people pushing in to front of security screening. The airport exploits car parkers who are impacted by flight cancellations - why? If it is not possible to fly due to a cancellation, why should I face a charge for additional parking?Meals upstairs enjoyable. A lack of power points to supply mobile devices. Cleaners cleaning toilets (urinals) whilst in use - how is that allowed??",3
2583,"Pity that the entrance to the airport and car parks are always undergoing road works, changes. It never seems to finish in all the years I have been travelling using the airport.",4
2584,"Very poor experience parking in the Multi Storey Car Park at Manchester T1. Return flight was cancelled due to bad weather and obviously booking in advance meant I had gone over my allotted time even though other drivers could not make it to the Airport either. On return which was via Birmingham Airport I had to collect my car and nobody was available for help ... I asked over 5 Airport Staff on what to do in this event and every single one sent me to a wrong area. In the end I just drove to the barrier where it just asked for £25 more to get out. Absolute rip off with no recourse , considering the weather affected everyone it was very dissapointing end to an already awful trip",2
2585,"It's a sh1t experience, from d1ckheads who take up two parking spaces, to a packed departure hall with no seats, and expensive food & drinks.",2
2586,"Overall a positive experience, easy to find, a clean place , and smooth transit from parking to flight.",4
2587,Improved street lighting is necessary-some not working so difficult when arriving during the hours of darkness.Surfaces could be better with lined spaces.,4
2588,Great service car found quickly on return,5
2589,Excellent facilities to give you the best start and finish to your holiday or any other travel needs.,5
2590,"Fast efficient service. No major problems, everyone seems friendly enough.",5
2591,"Easy and quick to book online, but expensive. The current road works at the airport  make it more difficult finding the right car park, and you can end up a fair way from the part of T1/T3 that you need to be in. We ended up about a 10 -15 minute walk away, which is much further than when we have previously used this service.Would benefit from having more staff around for very early/late flights, as we weren't sure if we were in the right place, but there was no-one to ask. We've used this service loads of times before, so its not like we were unfamiliar with the layout of the airport-just found that this time it was much more difficult to navigate around the road works.",3
2592,"The first time I have used the airport meet and greet parking service,I would highly recommend.",5
2593,No problems using car park have used many times before and would recommed,5
2594,Park Jet parking is not up to scratch and would not use again. Buses take too long and go around a number of terminals before they drop off at T1. It took an extra 50 minutes after parking to get to the terminal check in.,3
2595,None of these sites should insist you have to enter a written comment exceeding x number of words or spaces,3
2596,"I Travel Frequently, it does not matter which terminal, always looked after professionally.",5
2597,From dropping the car off to flying out and returning to pick car up effortless!!!,5
2598,"Where queues at most airports are the norm rather than the exception, at Manchester they at least appear to work hard to keep them to a minimum. Overall, really quite good in general terms but needs a better system of notification and last call for boarding etcetera's as in the private departure lounges their are no announcements.",4
2599,I would recommend this company to everyone,5
2600,"First class - so so easy - stress free parking, friendly staff and easy access to terminal.",5
2601,Very organised and efficient despite how busy the airport is . Some queuing but calm and safe.,5
2602,Used the meet and greet service numerous times before and have always been satisfied but on this occasion I checked my mileage on my return and was surprised to find my car had covered 4 miles while I was away . Where had it been ? Who has driven it ? What about insurance?,3
2603,The ser ice potentially very good... but signposting non existent and wrong satnav provided with instructions.   On return there is no signi g in airport to find the car park bus.. and worse the staff wefe not able to help.,3
2604,"Love this place the fact I'm always off somewhere nice , but it's great from meet and greet and fast track security always pay that little bit extra to ease my journey.😎",5
2605,"Parking is OK, expensive but a drama to relocate the correct direction from within the terminal due to insufficient signposting .",3
2606,Generally good but departures areas need improvement to cope with larger aircraft .,4
2607,"SECURITY CLEARANCE IS A NIGHTMARE, WITH UNSYMPATHETIC JOBSWORTHS IN CHARGE. MEET AND GREET SHOULD BE UNDER COVER, AND THE DIRTINESS,  ARRIVAL AREAS IN PARTICULAR,  IS A SHAME ON OUR COUNTRY COMPARED TO FOREIGN AIRPORTS",3
2608,"Convenient to me with plenty of parking. However, current roadworks and construction result in congestion and very busy roads close to the airport. Drop off and collection of passengers by car, is difficult. Airport itself tends to be overcrowded and exceptionally busy. Security procedures are slow and tedious. Not a pleasant experience!",2
2609,"Big, Clean, Easy, Perfect :)",5
2610,"when I needed to change times of departure I rang number, left message and they got back to me straight away, they found our booking and changed it immediately and very successfully.",5
2611,No issues. Car registration recognition system makes experience so easy. Bus transfer runs frequently. Overall experience as advertised. Will use again.,5
2612,Close to departure building. Easy to get in and out of car park. No hassle would definitely use again,5
2613,"Don’t pay for a valet, they don’t do it, and don’t refund you",3
2614,"Dont use the valet service, my 5 year old would of done a better job!!!!  parking is fine though",1
2615,"A busy airport, have used nicer have used worse. Every one has there own opinion and that invariably is subjective.",4
2616,"New car park service for M&G did not work with car arrival at T1 but car returned to T3 and nobody knew why, wait 20 minutes before car is returned and therefore defeats the whole experience, high cost and confidence in the new system.",1
2617,Apart from a very rude border control agent all good this time.,5
2618,Having tried different types of parking. This was by far the best option. No waiting around. I previously tried the meet and greet but kept waiting over 45mins for car to be brought back,5
2619,Finding T3 meet and greet difficult with road works . Security experience was stressful and poor not exceptionally busy but what I pack in bags i.e. Liquids etc for east Midland didn't apply at Manchester so I was stressed having to change everything after thinking I'd been well organised. Then my hand bag was sent to be extra checked which is fine but along with other passengers was made to wait at desk over 10 minutes whilst staff ignored us and milled around one even going to sit down!  I found them rude and some passengers where getting agitated .Escape lounge was great the staff where so friendly and helpful . Food was ok but adequate could do with more choices and we had to  to keep waiting for hot food  and salad was getting a bit limp ! Drink choice was excellent . Loved the whole experience .Boarding was smooth and well organised even though it's Ryanair .,3
2620,"Terminal 1 is very good, clean and good choice of shops . Terminal 3 needs a refurb and new shops . Limited available .",4
2621,**** good overall experience ****Collecting baggage area could be better in every way,4
2622,"Excellent easy to get to, carpark in walking distance, airport experience good",5
2623,Easy to use and book but be careful getting out is not allows as easy. Make sure you have your booking reference to hand before you get to the barrier.,4
2624,Vehicle damaged and poor contact points trying to resolve.,1
2625,Traffic around airport can be bad. Security and passport control can be a nightmare. But it's a smallish clean and friendly airport.,3
2626,"Huge queues at security give yourself loads of extra time if you don't want to miss a flight and get ready for a wall of noise in the airport, very few quiet areas to relax.",2
2627,"An excellent international regional airport with good access roads and parking, with an increasing number of international departures,",4
2628,"The car parks here are excellent. Easy to find and access. Unfortunately that's where the good experience ended.Getting through security when leaving the country was an absolute nightmare. We were hearded into a horrible room where we had to queue for about 45 minutes. Whilst in that room various staff members were announcing the prohibited items, or items that had to be bagged, unfortunately all the members of staff had a different idea of what was what, which just led to mass confusion where nobody knew what to do.On the way back into the country we were stood waiting for our suitcases for an hour. After a long flight, that's the last thing anyone wants. It was horrible.",1
2629,Overall Manchester airport is excellent but a hold up at security caused us to miss our fight. Every other member of staff did their best to help us,4
2630,"The worse airport in the UK to fly from. It is tired, disorganised, run on a shoestring, understaffed, not clean, staff are not customer friendly. Try to avoid flying from Manchester",1
2631,"it was easy to find the car park with the instructions given, even though the layout was different due to road works.  we parked handed in our keys at meet and greet and were in the terminal in a couple of minutes.  security was very straight forward.  It has to be said that this was a 9am flight in February so it was relatively quiet.  But a good experience.",4
2632,"Car park is ok but got charged £25 for an extra day, I consider this to be disproportionate.",3
2633,Excellent and reliable service. Makes travelling from MAN much easier,5
2634,Normally I pay the high rates and enjoy the M&G service but having to walk further due to a remodeling of the service that I wasn't aware of ruined the experience this time.,3
2635,"Airport fantastic, Jet 2 Go faultlessGetting out the meet and greet carpark a disaster!!!GET IT SORTED",5
2636,I know it’s the closest airport but compared to others and to the airports we travel too Manchester airport is great place to start my holiday.,4
2637,It needs rebuilding. Its like arriving in the early 80's. A very disappointing first impression of the North of England.,1
2638,Terrible service. Had to walk from jet parks 1 to terminal die to heavy congestion(roadworks) despite arriving in plenty of time. No mention on website prior to booking,1
2639,The system doesn't always recognise pre-bookings meaning a delay at departure from the car park,2
2640,"This company are efficient,  accommodating and flexible.  They allowed us to change days after we had arrived and everything was easy for them to do. They took the stress out of a bad situation. I would definitely use them again. It is so much better than waiting 10 minutes in the freezing  cold /rain for a bus to the car parks",5
2641,"I generally try to avoid using Manchester Airport if possible. Car parking is good, but a little pricey, but then the experience goes downhill. Check in and security is generally slow, primarily I think due to insufficient staff. Departures feels very cramped with too much retail and not enough general space. On arrival immigration is always slow, but baggage reclaim is prtetty good most of the time.",3
2642,Great staff with a helpful and supportive attitude.,5
2643,"The car park was poorly signposted and the post code did not take me to the car park. Leave at least 30 minutes to get from your car to the terminal as the buses are every 15 minutes and stop at Terminal 3, 1 and then 2. I think this will vastly improve once the road works/improvements are complete around the airport.",2
2644,"Was late coming back and they let me out with no charge! Having just been abused and charged £100 on a Rome train for not getting my ticket 'stamped', was nice to be back in friendly Manchester",5
2645,Manchester Airport staff are great. Location of Meet & Greet carpark helps to reduce stress however the carpark is currently a little tricky to enter and exit due to some on going development work. Checkin/baggage drop off and security can be a little chaotic depending on time and day. Airport terminal has good selection of shops with something for everyone. Overall I have never had a really bad experience. Keep up the good work everyone!,4
2646,"Car park meet and greet was fine , airport always seems disorganised for departures , had a very rude member of staff this time dealing with us at the declaration area, the place where you put your stuff through the scanner, other times at the airport has been fine ,",4
2647,Meet and great very poor should be called “ drop you car off and good luck finding it in the rain and wind.”,1
2648,Took 1 hour to get through customer and 45 minutes for my baggage to arrive. Automatic passport machines only 3 out of 10 working. Staff did not know why and were uninterested. waited 45 minutes for bag to come off the belt.Pasport control is an ongoing issue in this third-world airport and so will not be using Manchester again,2
2649,"GoodWas very easy to book online, carpark was difficult to find due to the road works but eventually found it.  After that, easy to get through and board flight.",4
2650,Departures is fine.  Car parks are easy to use.  Arrivals is abysmal.,3
2651,Easy to use no worrying about parking before going or finding car on return staff most helpful even though the weather was bitterly cold windy and damp a smile was given with clear instructions as to where to park and what to do,5
2652,Roadworks around the airport make findi g car parks a little more challenging. Allow a little extra time. The terminal is busy and some signs are not clear as a result. Don't rush and it becomes clear. Security are very helpful and friendly. Best in the UK from my experience.,4
2653,Perfect meet and greet experience. Quick walk to the terminal and back again to pick your car up. Just what you need when you land early hours in the morning.,5
2654,Very happy with the service provided. Quick key drop off and car was waiting in easy location in return. From picking up my bags I was in the car and out of the car park within 8 minute. Will definitely use again.,5
2655,Meet and Greet is fab.  Everything about it is easy from booking to dropping your car off to collecting.  Would use everytime.,5
2656,Clearing customs control inbound was a major issue.,3
2657,"Very disappointed that Manchester Airport Meet and Greet damaged my car and have failed to take responsibility.  The damage was not great, I did not spot it at midnight in a poorly lit car park after a long, tiring journey- but despite CCTV cameras everywhere, a very prompt report as soon as it became light, and being a regular user to date they have refused to even look at the issue.",1
2658,Car parking facilities are good. Check in generally good. Security is good. Cleanliness of some areas of the airport (including toilets) is poor.,3
2659,Multi story car parks close to the terminals are expensive.,4
2660,"Long queues closed check in desks not enough passport desks open.  Too many shops, not enough seating",3
2661,Best parking experience ever. No hassle or worries. Will use every time I travel,5
2662,"Great to be able to park so close to the terminal, great staff friendly and helpful albeit sadly during busy periods the attendance guys to get grief when doing a great job…… The only downfall is it is getting a little expensive to park here.",5
2663,"The parking area was well signposted from the motorway.Entrance into the car park was extremely simple, with number plate recognition allowing me to drive in easily.Upon entering the car park, it was a bit difficult to determine what direction the Terminal Entrance stairwells were in, but not terrible. It would have been helpful to know so we could park as close as possible to the entrance.Exiting was easy and well signposted to the various routes.",4
2664,"When flying from Manchester we always useTerminals 1&3long stay CarparkIt's quick and easy with good access from the motorway, good discounts on parking on offer throughout the year if you sign up to to email",5
2665,So simple from booking to arrival. The car park is a short stroll from the terminal.,4
2666,Top marks for fast passport control for families with young children.,5
2667,Massive queue at check in and security with 4 security lanes closed despite the large number of passengers. 2 hours to get thorugh to air side. Mcr is poorly managed as they know how many passengers will arrive each day and should set up the process to manage this.,1
2668,"Easy access and secure on site parking, close to terminal",4
2669,Convenient but expensive - particularly for a one night park,4
2670,Excellent and easy overall experience. Will definitely use again when travelling from Manchester,5
2671,"Good, as expected.",4
2672,road works in area caused confusion upon leaving,4
2673,Very good service,4
2674,A great efficient way to park at the airport .,5
2675,"Long stay car park for terminals 1 & 3 is undergoing some roadworks this means that the normal navigation route around the car park is not available and you have to drive through a No Entry sign, the wrong way down a one-way avenue, this is rather disturbing at the entrance.I always find it quicker to walk to the terminals than wait for the bus, the service isn't what it used to be.On returning I am forced to use the automated passport control machines, even though they fail every time and then I have to queue again to see a customs officer. Let me go straight to the human queue!When exiting the car park on the last two occasions, the very left hand barrier has not allowed me out, I have had to reverse and go to the next barrier. The first time I had a car park bus behind me in the lane, he was not best pleased. If this lane is for buses only then mark it as such.",4
2676,Meet and Great parking is fine. The baggage return on deplaning is stall appallingly slow. Airport interior needs to be adequately heated.,4
2677,"Great Airport.  Only issue, incoming Immigration too slow.",5
2678,"Terminal 2 will be good when finished refurb, but is painful at the moment. The waiting areas in T3 are not sufficient and at peak times there is nowhere to sit. It would be great if there were pre bookable electric car charging points in the car parks. Service is always good though and staff usually very friendly.",3
2679,"Excellent Service, can't wait to go there again!!",5
2680,Awful awful airport. Staff do their best.,1
2681,"For the convenience of parking in Terminal 3 Multi Storey, you now seem to have to pay through the nose for this, with a 36 hour stay costing £59.00, which is a £10.00 increase in the last 12 months.  Furthermore, car users are being squeezed further once you enter the parking area, with PREMIUM PARKING now taking up more and more bays, making travel even more frustrating than usual through Manchester AirportGive yourself extra time if you intend to use this car park or preferably find another!",3
2682,Thank you very much! Excellent services.,5
2683,Car park was easy to find and very easy to use,5
2684,"Really good, so simple and easy",5
2685,There is work going on.allow extra time for parking.,5
2686,Easy to use & find. Right on the door step of departures & arrivals in the terminal or back in your car within 2-3 mins. If you can i would recommend using the meet & greet service. Saves time on trying to find a parking space.,4
2687,The entrance to Manchester Airport looks like a disaster zone at the moment. I made a wrong turn and ended up having to drive back on the motorway to the A538 junction to get back to where I wanted to be... not impressed! This is added to the major roadworks going on both the A538 and the Styal Road which are the main access routes to the Airport from Wilmslow / Macclesfield. Passengers leave plenty of time for your journey.,2
2688,"Terminal 1 is old and tired, particularly in arrivals.  Excellent experience in customs leaving Manchester on this occasion but many security lanes are often shut even at peak times leading to huge delays. Security officers in arrivals would benefit from supplementary customer training, all passengers should be talked to politely with dignity and respect, security officers should not but did appear intimidating. Any other business would lose customers if their staff spoke to customers in the same manner as the officer who pulled us over. Any sensible passenger understands the requirements for tights security but all passengers are actually innocent of breaching customs regulations until proven guilty. This officer almost seemed disappointed that we'd done nothing wrong!",3
2689,The airport is now somewhat dated and needs to be brought up to modern standards of world airports.,3
2690,"At Long stay 2 car parks twice in less than a year the organisation has been appalling despite pre-booking, first denied entry by an employee saying it was full when obviously it wasn't entailing a 10 minute argument before let in, on second trip barrier didn't allow exit then told we were in a staff parking area which had clearly been re-designated from public to staff between entry and exit 5 days later, Sort it out MAG!",1
2691,"Great all round, but spoiled by attitude of ""security personal"" on departure.  These are minimum wage staff with some kind of strange god complex who do nothing to make the airport or air travel more secure!",3
2692,The multi story long stay car park at terminal 2 is brilliant and the fact that the barrier opens immediately we approached saved so much time and hassle. The cost is equivalent to a return taxi journey with no waiting. So it is a no brainer to use the car park facilities.,5
2693,Fine no problems. Meet and Greet parking is the best option,4
2694,Easy parking: number plate recognition works well. Stress- free experience.,4
2695,We parked in term 1 long stay brilliant,5
2696,No real problems apart from the work that's going on at roadways entering the airport but in time it will be done .,4
2697,"Staff are excellent, booking is straightforward. Watch the roadworks and allow more time. Parking is expensive but that depends on how much you value any time saved and who’s paying.At busy periods allow plenty of time to get through security and don’t buck the regime, it only cuts your nose off to spite your face.",4
2698,When we arrived at the airport it took us three attempts to find the entrance to the multi-storey car park.      It is not state 'departures' but only 'arrivals' which was really confusing.   We had to go back on ourselves to the island three times to try and find where we needed to be - the sign was very poor.,3
2699,other than poor signage the overall experience was very good.,4
2700,"Car parking at Manchester excellent, arrivals through immigration leaves a lot to be desired - why do ALL the e-passport gates never work?",5
2701,"Terrible waits for getting off the airplane, passport control and don't even mention waiting for luggage! Why can other airports have you off the plane and out the door in 15 minutes but you never can!",2
2702,Great experience from the airport team for parking,5
2703,"needs updating in the terminals, no streamlining, a bit like mish-mash mix when everything is all thrown into the same bucket and given a stir. jet parks not very good.",2
2704,Disgraceful and chaotic organisation of passport control with rude staff.,1
2705,"No problems using meet and greet, easy to book and used many times.",4
2706,"HiJust a line to say it was the first time we used the meet and greet car parking at Manchester airport, very well organised and value you for money, we will be using you again, that more I can say about the valet I paid for, when i dropped off the car I was told it was not sure that it would be done as the company were having trouble keeping up with demand, when I picked my car up I asked the question and the guy informed me that it had been done abut if I had any issues to go back and tell him, to be honest after a long day we just jumped in the car and set off home, on the way home I noticed the interior mirror had not been cleaned like wise the glass over the the spedo etc etc was again not cleaned and to cap it all when I have been out to the car this morning there are still finger marks on the back near side window from my grand daughter after she was recently in the car, I made a joke of it to her saying its a good job I am having it valet to get rid of those marks, to be honest the windows in general don't look good at all on the inside, the outside is fine, but the interior not very good at all, I just thought I would bring this issue to you attention.also the lounge was not organised on arrival no hot food out when I asked a young lady she she was sorry and would sort it, she went into the kitchen and came out and said she couldn't find the chef I then went for a paper and the chef in question was said with the girls on reception talking, the hot food came out some fifteen minutes later over all not a good over all experience not sure I will be using it in the future Geoff Berry",2
2707,Thoroughly profession and friendly set up !!,5
2708,"Easy to book, easy to use. First class - highly recommended",5
2709,Easy to use. Good value.,5
2710,T2 car park bus driver was miserable and unhelpful.,3
2711,Both our outward and inward journey was smooth and hassle free,4
2712,reasonably good with some help from staff.,4
2713,Used the multi storey at terminal 1 ease of parking and walk to terminal excellent and good value for 5 days will use again providing charges don’t over inflate,5
2714,Affordable and stress free parking at the meet and greet. Will definitely use this service again.,5
2715,"Great service when booking car park, convinient and easy to find,have used them several times, but unfortunately I won't be using them again the drivers of the buses are terrible, they are arrogant,disrespectful and show lack of respect and seem to have no knowledge of their service, no ability to deals with people,they are rude and unhelpful.holidays should be a happy experience not returning to your car for your journey home discussing how rude the drivers are",2
2716,Pointless reviewing an airport because you'll use it regardless if you can't get to your destination any other way.........,2
2717,"Just love the ease of driving  to airport. Just wish the roadworks would hurry up and get finished.Parking is great bus is great,transfer brilliant both ways",5
2718,not very good bus driver,1
2719,Good parking service.  Would recommend.,5
2720,"Paid for parking in the multi story, was poor very hard to find a spot and no trolleys on any floors. Difficult with kids. Security not helpful and aggresive.",3
2721,"Previously we have found the airport to be untidy and dirty, especially in the restaurants and bars, but this time due to our delays we went straight to boarding.",3
2722,"Immigration staff could have been better they were rude and abrupt on our departure. We were held up by the body scanner and our bags, watches, wallets and phones were all left at the end of the conveyor unattended for any one to pick up if they wished.",3
2723,"We parked for 9 days in Feb, the price was good very easy to do & the bus to the airport was good & quick & clean.we looked at booking again in June, but for some reason the price had shoot up, which i cant understand because we wanted to book at the same airport the same space & amount of days?",5
2724,Every easy to use stress free,5
2725,"Car Parking - awful. The number plate recognition didn't work (other people have told me it NEVER works). We pressed the help button and had a lengthy wait for a response. When we finally got into the car park, there were no indications of where we might find spaces. We drove around each floor and finally reached the upper areas, which are outside. It was a snowy day and the ramps are steep and hadn't been gritted, so it was impossible to drive up them. A horrible way to start a holiday.Passport Control (Arrival) - if you want to know what cattle in a pen feel like, this is probably the nearest thing. Expect to queue for hours.",1
2726,Meet and greet parking on T2 was excellent. First time we’ve used it but will in future be our first choice airport parking. Efficient and friendly staff when dropping off and picking up car.,5
2727,Quick and efficient process. Will use again.,5
2728,"Terminal 3: some security staff unnecessarily aggressive towards customers.Terminal 1: although the terminal is rather dated, the staff are much more polite.Jet Parks 2 Car Park: if it's raining, take your wellies; it's a mudbath!",1
2729,"Long wait for buses - both from carpark and from airport.JetParks 2 not easy to find due to roadworks is more or less parking in a field, muddy and lots of puddles",3
2730,"As an able-bodied person Manchester Airport is great. I love the shops, duty free and lounges. However, when I travel with my disabled husband the whole experience is extremely stressful - not enough wheelchair support staff at departures mean we typically wait around for ages, often in no-man's land at the top of stairs. He gets extremely anxious and I don't get a chance to look around the shops, let alone use the lounge passes which I have now stopped buying. Going through security is  a nightmare - they seem to single us out (a couple in their 60s with one in a wheelchair) for extra searches, addingot his anxiety. Please learn from other airports like Birmingham and Gatwick, who have a much improved policy towards disabled passengers.",2
2731,"Although I had an issue with exiting, due to my own fault, I called for help and it was sorted quickly.  The member staff I spoke to was absolutely lovely, very helpful and very funny too.  We're be using this service again in future, it's worth paying that bit extra without having to wait for the buses to take us back to the car park.",5
2732,Very good airport. Clean and friendly staff. Only downside is that the passport control area is relatively small for the massive amount of passengers.. expect waiting times there. Also the parking costs are too high!,5
2733,Not enough spaces in the jet 1 car park so don't go in that one !,1
2734,Overall a very pleasant experience.,4
2735,They give you the wrong post code. Spent a long time driving around looking for the car park. Other than that it was a good car park my car was fine bus was waiting both arr and dep,2
2736,"Can't complain, happy with their service",4
2737,I use a walker and the staff fell over backwards to help me including bring my car to the office so I did not have to walk far,4
2738,"No reservations, but a clearer web-site map to access the Car Park would alleviate the stresses of the last 500 metres!",5
2739,"Airport is Good, we used the meet & greet service for our car, great concept and great service.....one down side, finding it was difficult, keep your eyes peeled, but would defo` recommend, at least we know where it is now....",4
2740,excellent - much better than off site meet n greet !,5
2741,"Excellent service, staff always friendly and helpful, even ran me home on one occasion when my car would not start",5
2742,Not as good as it used to be as the facility is over capacity and they struggle to cope with the volume of customers. The parking lanes are really narrow so it is difficult to get out of your car without knocking the next vehicle - hence they have installed cameras on entry now!! The staff though are very pleasant.,2
2743,"My car was vandelised at theT1 and T3 long stay car park.Someone has dragged a suitcase over my bonnet causing £500 worth of damageI spoke to someone at the barrier who was very clear to me that the car park was not responsible and I had parked at my own riskRang airport police, received a crime ref number but it not going to be worth cliaming on insurance as exess is £250 and will loose over 10 years no claims",1
2744,Traffic managment arround airport is a nightmare whilst all the road changes are taking place. Could not understand that the on week in half term lights are placed in front of the airport carpark delaying everything by 1hr!!!!,3
2745,Altogether a nicer experience than going via Heathrow.,5
2746,Manchester airport is very good,4
2747,"A very easy to follow airport with top rate security. Excellent duty free shops and refreshments  and everywhere kept extremely clean, especially the toilets.",5
2748,"Unfortunately once again Manchester airport has failed to deliver on so many levels, customer service, speed, efficiency, courteous staff, the list is endless, my only regret is that more airlines don’t use Liverpool airport.",1
2749,When if ever will the airport do something about Terminal 1 security experience.  It should be a source of embarrassment to all management who fail to deal with an appalling service that impacts every traveller....unless you pay to avoid the grim experience with Fast Track.,2
2750,Ok airport. Very long queque at passport control!,4
2751,Very easy to park but it is confusing to get there due to lots of road works.,4
2752,Meet and Greet at Manchester Airport is excellent. Much cheaper than an airport shuttle service and very easy to go through/book etc. Highly recommended.,4
2753,Meet & Greet good service will definitely use again,4
2754,good service at meet and greet terminal 1 they are at present improving the service and space so was surprised that the service and experience was so good seeing that they are making improvements at the moment,5
2755,A seamless transition from parking to embarkation and return; everything close at hand and within easy walking distance with clear directions.,4
2756,Still suffering from queuing and chaos from now well established security requirements. This should have been addressed by now.Passport control into UK was appalling using automated passport readers - not enough machines all this reflects is the commerciality of the airport in reducing staff without sufficient investment in the technology.This comes after getting through notorious US immigration in less than 30 minutes,3
2757,"The car was not meet & greet, it was parked a long way away - might as well have been in the multi-storey!   When I did get to the car the car park was so busy that the car was blocked in and it was difficult to get out of the space and then navigate my way around the other cars to the tight exit.Staff were excellent but the service itself was poor.",3
2758,Terrible. Multi story terminal 1. Insufficient number of parking spaces. Parking spaces too small. No luggage trolleys until you get into the terminal. Dirty. Old. Tight to manoeuvre a car. Avoid.,1
2759,Jet 2 baggage drop very disorganised and meant a massive build up of queue to go through security,3
2760,I was very disappointed that my car wheels and arches were covered in a limestone residue.  My car was brought to your car park clean and clearly had been driven off tarmac leaving it a mess.  I will probably think twice about using your car park again unless this is improved.,3
2761,connecting domestic flights at terminal 3 have to exit arrivals and then return through bag checks again to get to new flight. Absolutely crazy system and a waste of time for everybody.,3
2762,In my opinion the airport cannot cope with the extra security imposed since last year. too many queues are now forming due to backing up at security checks. Seems to be undermanned as scanner isles are left unused.,3
2763,"Due to travel plans changing, I telephoned to ask for a refund only 20 mins after making a car park booking.  This was refused.Was told as this was within 24 hours of arrival time at the airport they could not offer a refund - unacceptable and ridiculous.",1
2764,Excellent. Never been so easy :-),5
2765,"Be careful you get the correct car park, signage is poor.",1
2766,"Excellent services, very helpful staff.",5
2767,A good experience overall but did go into the wrong entrance for T3 multi-storey car park.,4
2768,"Good airport, let down by road works and diversions, could be earlier and better signage to Jet car parks.",5
2769,Terminal 1 multi storey so convenient and good value for short trips,4
2770,Easy quick access to airport,5
2771,Not a good airport to fly to/from. An embarrassment for the UK if compared with most good airports. It cannot decide whether to be a proper business airport for normal people or a package holiday airport for chavs. It gets the balance disturbingly wrong,2
2772,"OK the post code for the Terminal 1 multistory car park is incorrect, stressful when you are in a rush!Equally why can't we get passport control to work better in this country and avoid the queues? Charge the airlines a little more per passenger and make it queue less as most European airports are eg Hamburg? Its not rocket science but this issue constantly lets this country down.",3
2773,"Don't be late to collect your car, it will cost you an extra £25, even if it's a delayed flight.  MAG will find a way to blame anybody else but themselves",2
2774,"February 2018, Terminal 2Lots of alterations going on both externally and internally.All the staff remain very helpful and cheerful.  With additional staff at car park entrances explaining the changes.  Security is thorough but it’s done as swiftly as it possibly can be.  Travellers would help by preparing themselves before they actually get to the security point, removing belts, emptying pockets, removing jewellery, liquids ready for the tray etc....thus enabling the process to run as smoothly as it can.We’ll done Manchester Airport.",5
2775,The easy and hassle free way to park and fly at Manchester airport.,5
2776,"Flying out was good, arrivals back in through passport control is like a cattle market, staff watch passengers (especially elderly) struggle with the scanners for passports whilst queues build would rather see staff in uniforms helping, and smile it costs nothing this may be someone's first experience of the UK lets try and make it positive.",4
2777,Everything runs smoothly but it is a little confusing on arrival and departure at the moment with the improvement work they are carrying out but should be great when all finished.,5
2778,"Easy carparking good departure areas easy to park and retrieve car, arrivals area could be cleaner.",4
2779,Simple to find parking and easy to get through the car park.  Saving me time to relax.,4
2780,"Chaotic airport, avoid Jet Park 3 if you treasure time",2
2781,everything always runs smoothly. never had any problems,5
2782,Porly signposted and poor surfacing were a drawback although parking is near the terminal.,3
2783,"Easy , hassle free and a short walk to the terminal",5
2784,"Excellent service again from Meet & Greet, now if they could just sort the weather out better......!",5
2785,the route to the car park is not sign posted.  really helpful at 5am,1
2786,very good very easy process,5
2787,"My trip didn't start well. For some reason the multi-storey car park I has paid extra to park in was wholly inadequate. To be honest the actual car park itself is need of some TLC in the pakring areas - it's acceptable once you exit.Then for some reason, a major international airport had closed its main security gates at T1 shunting everyone through the smaller security area. No issue with the security people - they were doing their best, but surely this is not something we should expect in this day and age? Some people had to wait 40 minutes to have their bags checked if the scanner showed something!?! I will use the airport again because where I travel, it's often the nearest location, but if you can use Liverpool I would suggest you do, it's smaller, nicer, the car park is much better and security never seems to be that much of an issue.",2
2788,"EXCELLENT FROM START TO FINISH. PARKED UP EASILY, STRAIGHT DOWN IN THE LIFT TO DEPARTURES AND AWAY WE WENT. WE FOUND OUR CAR STRAIGHT AWAY ON ARRIVAL AND NO PROBLEMS GETTING OUT OF THE AIRPORT.",5
2789,"Check in Fine, security area cluttered with long queues, Duty Free Ok and waiting areas clean and OK. Toilets clean",3
2790,Meet & Greet is an excellent service always quick and easy,5
2791,Terrible - book a place in the long stay only to arrive to see it full! Had to park in a dirty arrivals car park instead,1
2792,"no reservations, I would recommend this company to anyone.",5
2793,"queuing at security could be made easier, more staff needed to prevent long delays",3
2794,"Too expensive to park for one night , in-helpful and arrogant staff.Travelled to Dublin on business and that is a completely different experience , very helpful and friendly staff throughout the airport.",3
2795,"Excellent service, straightforward no issues whatsoever",5
2796,Building work at terminal 2 unfortunately causes disruption. However the signposting for the long stay car park was poor and confusing. The bus to the terminal was clean and the driver very friendly and helpful. I feel that this airport is becoming increasingly expensive and noted that all products advertised in the bars were not on sale.,2
2797,Relatively efficient airport but overexploits the commercial opportunities hence few places to sit in comfort.  Sadly the old place  (T1) looks rather tired compared to other European airports but it gets the job done without  much hassle.,3
2798,"As usual a good experience made easier by the fact that we are regular users of the Airport. Only snag on exiting was that we had pre paid but the barrier didn't raise. Had to communicate with the controller which frustrated those behind us for a short time, Gave Reg and Name and we were allowed through. This is the only time it has happened in years of travelling through Manchester Airport, so not a 'big deal'....",5
2799,Excellent airport. Cannot fault it.,5
2800,"I feel Manchester airport is just about making money and customers are just an inconvenience. Over the last few years it has gone into a sharp decline .I used to be proud of what I always called "" our airport "" not any longer .Poor car parking ,Shabby check in areas ,disgusting and dirty toilets , unfriendly  staff ,I could go on and on.",1
2801,Excellent service...easy access car parks,4
2802,Very busy airport. Well managed. Smooth transaction through to flights.,4
2803,Great if you have a car full as it is reasonably priced so we just split the cost and no waiting around for taxis.,5
2804,Terminal 2 long stay car park is having quite a lot of disruption caused by works on a new terminal building so some bus stops were closed and diverted and the site was quite muddy in places,3
2805,"Fab airport experience, would definitely use the multi story car park again",5
2806,Very easy booking process and hassle free entry and exit process!,5
2807,Why park 10 miles from the airport when the airport parking is very competitively priced?,4
2808,"Travel through Manxhester airport a few times/year. Our latest trip in Febraury 2018 was no different from the other times. Everything went smoothly and efficiently; parking, check-in, secuirty, boarding, luggage handling etc.....Keep up the good work!",5
2809,"Manchester airport is a very good airport and provides direct flights to a majority of international and domestic airports. I would have given it 5 stars, except that the baggage is sometimes a little slow to arrive and the seating could be improved in departure lounge for terminal 3.",4
2810,"boring departure lounge....not great choices of food and overly expensive for the poor servings of breakfast items in the ""large breakfast barm""arrivals....massive queues...last thing you want after arriving at 10pm",3
2811,nice and easy parking made simple,4
2812,If you book in advance its much cheaper. So much easier than the train. Not too far to walk either. We found it much easier.,4
2813,"Brilliant service, buses run every 5-10 mins to airport so very frequent (although you could walk if preferred). Driver was friendly and approachable. Lots of parking spaces (may have to look a while, but loads available). Would definitely use again.",5
2814,"Easy to use, easy to get in and easy to get out. Very short walk from the terminal. No problems at all",5
2815,"From car parking to boarding, the whole process is very smooth",5
2816,"Flight out great, Escape Lounge was lovely.  Arrival at Manchester not so great. We had to wait 30 minutes to get off the plane because there were no steps available even though we were on a scheduled flight that arrived on time. Clearly that makes it difficult to predict when facilities are required. To cap it all we then had to wait over 30 minutes for our bags to arrive. It took longer to get off the plane and collect our bags than it took to fly from Paris.",2
2817,possibly the easiest airport for getting around and parking !,5
2818,Good experience overall. The automated key retrieval on exit was very quick and easy. Only negative was that the exit lanes getting out of the car park are too narrow when you have to do a sharp turn into them.,4
2819,"Arrived at Jet Parks Ringway car park at 07:00, and found a parking space three slots from a bus stop - there was plenty of availability - but had to wait about 20mins for transfer bus to arrive. We were in plenty of time so this was not an issue. The bus journey was easy and despite road works around the airport we arrived at Terminal 2, promptly.Our return flight was delayed by about an hour but after waiting for ages at baggage recovery we found a bus fairly quickly and returned to the car park. The exit procedure was very easy and we were soon on our way.I have used this particular car park before and would recommend it for its layout, ease of use and closeness to the airport terminals.",5
2820,I have not flown with flybe before and a while since I last used T3. I had booked short stay premier parking at T3 which i dd feel was expensive at £38 for less than 36 hours. The premier parking was not visible at the entrance to the multistorey and I had to drive round a second time to find the entrance. Once found parking was close to the departure part of the terminal. Controls were fine and security was efficient.  I did find the terminal crowded and the food in the main centre expensive. I did buy a pastrami panini which awas expensive at £5 and had very little filling. Hot lettuce does not work for me. The flight was slightly delay and there were announcements and a reason so that was positive. The flight in a twin prop was Ok but the overhead luggage space did not accommodate many bags. The return was good as the plane docked was right next to the passport control and I did not have to walk someway as usual.All in all a pleasant if not a very good experience. I think the choice of food in T3 could be improved (and be better value),4
2821,"Plus - clean and tidy with plentiful toilets.  Minus - long queue for security as not all bays were operating, long walks with no travelators between gates,  Poor surface in car parks.",3
2822,Its a great Airport to fly from.   They have everything down to almost perfection,5
2823,Meet and greet airport was a great success - will definitely use again.,5
2824,It was frustrating and that was mainly due to poor signage.,3
2825,Would recommend to all my friends as this was so easy to do and made the start to my holiday less stressfull.😊,5
2826,"Terrible and rude staff, unnecessary body searches done twice, shortage of restaurants in terminal 2. Usually travel from Newcastle and will continue to do so. Will never travel from Manchester again.",1
2827,"It is easy to find, and there is always staff to help .",5
2828,Meet and greet t2 always a good experience,5
2829,Road works on the way in confused us a little as we were dependent on the sat nav,5
2830,easy to find. need more spaces to park car.,5
2831,"Car parking is eay at Manchester Airport, the security is very poor and confusing and passport control on arrival is not even suitable.",3
2832,First time we have flown from Manchester. Everything went so smoothly and the car park is so close to the terminal will def use again,5
2833,"Excellent Meet and Greet parking and Executive lounge area, this is a good way to start your holiday.Airport security is a pain no matter the airport but it could be made better by deploying additional staff. It's not about the cost, it's about the experience which could be significantly improved. Additional staff in extra security lines, so easy to do. I guess that it's the bean counters that rule the day, certainly not the service manager. Will anything be done about it, I don't think so, why am I wasting my time doing this; we travel in hope.",4
2834,"Excellent friendly service which we've used many times. I really can't see how to improve it! Staff are very friendly & helpful, it makes airport parking relaxing rather than a hassle!",5
2835,No hassle from parking car to boarding plane.,5
2836,the car park sometimes is hard to find a space especially in busy periods but close to the terminals,3
2837,Entrance to multi storey ok. On exit had to buzz attendant as barrier would not raise. Long wait for baggage on return journey.,4
2838,"Have used the T1 meet and greet car parking several years ago. There is a considerable improvement now and it is great to use it.However, the arrangements in the arrivals area needs to be improved.",5
2839,"Came down with Australian flu and tried to cancel the parking the day before. The website wouldn't allow it, so I paid for nothing",1
2840,Easy booking system. No problem encountered. Friendly staff.,5
2841,"Hassle free and good price, cheaper than taxi. Too and from",5
2842,it does what is says on the tin if only the prices where standard and not hiked up over night,5
2843,A very easy process. No problems at all.,4
2844,Pre-booked Wheelchair Assistance at Manchester Airport is poor.  They are never on time to meet incoming flights and sometimes do not appear at all.,3
2845,Choose a regional airport for less congestion greater access and better service. Or travel to London for long haul for better service,2
2846,Overall I was very happy with how Manchester AirPort and parking was.,5
2847,"Best way to park at the Airport, having the car ready to get you home.",4
2848,"Great customer service throughout the departure and arrivals process, from Parking the car to getting back into it a week later! Although the security process is thorough, it didnt take excessively long and the staff were attentive and friendly.Baggage reclaim cold have been quicker but otherwise, a very smooth experience",5
2849,"Good value in winter months.  Easy to book, find, and park.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  The whole process was first class",5
2850,Simples drop off car get on transfer bus arrive at departures wot could be simpler 1st class service,5
2851,"Manchester is the most disorganised, ill-planned, and dirtiest airport in the world.  The roads into it are a shambles and the car park a disorganised maze.  Check-in is like assembling at the gates of a concentration camp.  Security is an absolute nightmare, with appalling procedures and staff.  There is no room to sit or eat in the delarture lounge, because they have stuffed the area with shops (that nobody uses).  There is no direct route to anywhere, so take your hiking boots and be prepared for a route march.  You will be going up, down, up, and round and round until you are utterly lost.And the staff are the most agressive, obnoxious and ill-educated cretins you are ever likely yo meet - shouting for you to go to a shorter queue in security, as if you would never think of going to the shorter line. And the security staff are petty dictators, feeling your testicles just to show you how powerful they are.Having passed though a hundred or more airports around the world, I can honestly say that Manchester is the worst of them all.  There is nothing I can hold up as being nice, or well designed or well planned.  The whole experience is a complete misery, from approach road to aircraft.  Sorry, I forgot, there is one really good thing about Manch Airport - the motorway leading out from it.  Only then will your heart-rate return to normal....!.",1
2852,very satisfied with the overall parking experience,5
2853,"Everything about the airport was great except for when we returned to the UK. Our baggage took 50 minutes to come through which is the poorest i have ever experienced and the border guards that you have to show your passport too are the most miserable I have ever come across. Birmingham, east Midlands, Liverpool, Stanstead and all European destination border guards greet you with a smile and are pleasant. Manchester meet you like your a criminal and an inconvenience to them! If it wasn't for these 2 things our experience would have been perfect.",4
2854,Signage terrible to certain parking areas,1
2855,"Smooth check in, flights on time so no complaints. Enjoyable experience in terminal so look forward to our next visit.",5
2856,"Check-in? okSecurity? ok, but tediousDeparture experience? okArrival experience? diabolical - surely the architect has now been dismissed!Baggage handling? Try to avoid it on return flights - it's chaosSecurity? OMG, it can only get worse from 2019Car parking? Adequate, once the barrier equipment is working.",2
2857,"From arriving at parking area, going through booking and customs was satisfactory considering this is a busy airport, no major complaints",5
2858,"Needs to be cleaner, tidier, brighter. Common areas are dingy, and why do we always have to arrive on the tarmac, and then have to climb several narrow stairs before joining long queues for passport control? The airport has many good points, but it now looks very dated when viewed against comparable continental airports.",3
2859,"excellent service, short walk to terminal.",5
2860,"Generally as good an experience as it can be during a stressful, for me, activity.",4
2861,easy and efficient car park to use. Helpful staff resolving a problem,5
2862,This was the first time I had used the long stay car park at the airport so I was a little apprehensive about getting lost. I had no need to worry; the parking was very well sign posted as was terminal 3. I have traveled from Manchester airport for many years now and have always had a good experience.,5
2863,"I have used Manchester Airport multi storey car parks many times over the years and always found the pre-booking system good value for money. After the collapse of Monarch, I found it almost impossible to change the terminal car park on existing bookings when changing to another airline that flies from a different terminal. Also, recently, the car park rarely allows bookings in the multi storey of more thann 7 days. This is awkward when travelling with someone with mobility issues.",4
2864,Excellent service - used T1 & T2 facilities due to previous excellent experience.,5
2865,Great service would totally recommend close proximity to terminal buildings easy in and out.,4
2866,It gets easier everytime,5
2867,If Heathrow is the gold standard for terrible airports Manchester seems determined to match them,1
2868,"I used M&G for terminal 3.  Drop off was fine, other than their being no valet service as now online only, but no option when originally booked online.  Pickup was a bit of a nightmare as my car had been parked that close to another it was impossible to get in via the drivers side.  The exit was also not very clear.",2
2869,"Generally a great experience, good choice of parking, Duty Free and eating.The only reason it doesn't get a five star is the amount of time i takes at passport control after the return flight, and the airport needs a massive cosmetic upgrade from outside.",4
2870,quick convenient and within walking distance. fair price,4
2871,"Going through security & having our bags checked is stressful & I fully understand it's stressful for the staff as well. As we had our bags scanned my partners bag was held back to be rechecked. We were told to wait in a queue to have his bag re scanned because they couldn't find the 1st image of the scan. They were running 1 hr behind & our flight was due to depart in 1.5hrs. No apologies from staff. We waited until my partners were due to be re scanned. The lady said she will give the bag back to us, but never did. We waited 1hr in total, only to find our bag was never supposed to be rechecked and was placed in the wrong conveyor belt by the staff. We tried to find out what was going on during this time and got confronted by several members of staff who were extremely rude & intimidating. My partner was extremely upset & wanted to complain but within minutes had the police warden watching over us. We were not aggressive, but are clearly upset, but we were accused of causing trouble. One of the female staff starting yelling ""that one has a stinking attitude"" referring to my partner. We later found our bag dumped in the corner in a tray where the public can easily steal our bag. I questioned this lady on why our bag was dumped here & not given back to us. She aggressively snapped at me saying it is not their responsibility to look after our bags. Not only this our phone charger was missing. They insisted that we made this up & coincidently their first scan of our bag was lost. Staff members purposely turned their badges away so I could not take their names. As we decided to call our losses as we really needed to catch our flight, they sent the police warden to follow us. He informed us that they asked him to have a word with us. He checked our passports, questioned us on our UK residency, purpose of trip, occupation & address in a public area. I have never been so humiliated in my life, we were treated like illegal immigrants. Not only that this police warden abused his authority on us & threatened to detain us if I continued question his actions. He suggested that I shouldn't dare to pull the race card on him as we are British citizens with chinese ethnicity. We are not the sort who are racially sensitive but we were not sure after he backtracked & said the security staff did not send him & he followed us on his own accord. We have both lived in manchester all our lives & loved being part of a friendly community. But this was another level of disgusting.",1
2872,"We usually use Birmingham Airport to travel from and I can honestly say after using Manchester airport twice in the last twelve months, it is so much better by far. It's cleaner,  brighter, friendlier and when you arrive back into the UK,  Manchester airport are much quicker getting your luggage off the plane and into the arrival area. Also again friendlier than Birmingham.",5
2873,"Good service, easy to use.",4
2874,Good Service and helpful staff although the current redevelopment of the airport access routes causes some delays,5
2875,As the airport is undergoing considerable amount of work i felt that the services they are providing was excellent,5
2876,Great airport. Need to improve passport control.,4
2877,Jet parks 3 excellent an reasonably pricedBus transfer quickStaff at airport friendly and helpful Only downside was terminal 3 limited choice prior to the flight and breakfast very overpriced and disappointing,4
2878,The car park is very good and would highly recommend. But I parked in Terminal 3 and flew from Terminal 1 - it stated a short walk but took some finding as lack of signs.on my return to collect my car it appears someone has bumped/hit my front drivers side wing and drove off,3
2879,"Car parking (Meet & Greet) excellent - Always quick and efficient - Fast Track service through check in and security was a waste of time and money. Despite being paid for, only the usual channels appeared to be available.",4
2880,Manchester airport always feels a little tired and run down and the staff never appear very happy. Compared to a lot of airports there is much room for improvement. If they spent as much money in the areas that need it as they do in the shopping area it would be a good start.,3
2881,Professional quick and easy process both departing and arriving at Manchester airport,5
2882,A good alternative to using your own transport.,4
2883,"Very poorly cleaned and maintained, very long queues at Security, unnecessarily shouty Security staff, if I didn't have to use Manchester Airport I wouldn't!",1
2884,"A busy but well run airport, clean with a lot of facilities. Parking was fairly straight forward and close to the airport (although I booked a premium space and paid a premium price!).",4
2885,Road signs can be a little unclear but if you know where you are going an excellent experience,4
2886,Quick efficient service and easy access to terminals with speedy check in through to departure. Good start to the day! Thank you.,5
2887,Security & immigration staff are very rude to passengers.,3
2888,LONG DELAY GOING THROUGH SECURITY EVEN WITH FAST TRACK AND NO LUGGAGE WAS EARLY  MORNING,4
2889,Long wait for our bags to come out  and no car park buses in T3 car park.,3
2890,Easy to use if you need a short stay car park next to the terminal,5
2891,Airport is very good and modern but better attention needs to be given to the arrivals process at the airport.Taxis in particular seem to give little respect to other cars and passengers who may be unsure of exact direction and therefore need more consideration given to them.,4
2892,"Excellent – no reservations, I would recommend this company to anyone.",5
2893,"Love Manchester Airport, always an easy place to fly from.",4
2894,"Number plate recognition didn't work, had to use the token think",3
2895,average as poor number plate recognition and poor signage for phone,3
2896,"I paid for a platinum valet , my car was returned dirty and with a broken windscreen",1
2897,"Everything met with our holiday needs, would use again and recommend to others! Our only gripe was the fact that we had to wait 20 mins plus for the bus at the start of our holiday! Would have been fine in warmer weather but it was at 03.30am and it was a very cold January night. 😊😊",4
2898,Good friendly hassle free service. Wouldn't use anything else,5
2899,Too much to pay £25 per day as a fine for the delay of picking the car on time,2
2900,Better than expected and priced better than I had thought,4
2901,"Not great signage due to roadworks a bit confusing, we where also looking for Meet &Greet on the signs but it is only highlighted as M&G,  but overall hassle free",4
2902,Good value. Good experience.,5
2903,Compared to other European airports such as Munich or Zurich Manchester is a distant third.,2
2904,poos Security and not sufficient x ray machines to handle the number of passengers,3
2905,Improvement from last few trips still very busy don't like going through selling area to reach gates,4
2906,"It gets worse every time I use It! It is getting dirtier, scruffier, it is too slow because there are too few staff to man the security checkpoints and the gate waiting areas are dirty & run-down. I am thinking about giving John Lennon @ Liverpool a go!",2
2907,Security were rude and let the airport down. I was hit in the elbow with a swinging door and didn’t even get acknowledged let alone an apology. He was well aware the door hit me! Other than that another excellent trip from MAN,4
2908,"Parking was great, short stay, right by the terminal, undercover to departures and good value for money compared to waiting for buses or meet and greet.",4
2909,"There are too many people using the airport and everything is slow.  There are not enough parking spaces, there are too few security staff and the airport lounges are generally full.",2
2910,"Easy to use . Short wait for buses , quick transfer times",4
2911,"Usually have no problems using Manchester Airport. However facilities at Terminal 3 are rather limited, very small shops, minimal choice of bars/restaurants",4
2912,Clean multi-storey car park really close to the departure terminal. Really convenient to use and not too badly priced.,5
2913,"Excellent parking facilities but getting there is a nightmare with all the roadworks going on (directions), horrendous and not easy to follow.Would be better if more bus stops in parking area and more frequent at both car park and airport.",4
2914,On arriving at check in i discovered that my return date was wrong by 1 day a genuine mistake due to an overnight flight.They would not extend my date even though they gave me a number to phone during my holiday .They charged me 25 pounds and were completely inflexible to the point of being greedy and not interested in helping.,1
2915,Compared to other airports of similar size this appeared on my visits the easiest.,5
2916,road access is bad both  (queue) to most terminals (all! at times) meet & greet parking was excellentterminals less too busy always work going on might be good when finished burt for now...not a great experience using terminals in MAN.,3
2917,"Security arrangements very unsatisfactory.Family members can get separated. So too their trays for scanning.These contain valuables, passports, wallet, phone etc often left unattended for some time.Very stressful",3
2918,Poor service. Jetparks 2 is a building site so a muddy field with gaps in the security fence and no signs few buses. Allow 2 hours to get back to your car.,1
2919,"Everything went well, value for money stops me giving 5 stars",4
2920,"Easy to find, hassle free parking. Car park surface was a bit rugged, so be careful with suitcase, but i’ve parked in worse. Great value for money x",5
2921,Hassle free parking. Frequent shuttle service but very short walk too.,5
2922,Manchester Airport is an efficient international gateway and I would recommend it to anyone,5
2923,Overcharged at every opportunity.,3
2924,"Car parking was cost effective this time but not always the case, as sometimes a taxi is more cost effective.Road works and improvements caused a bit of confusion after dropping my missus off at departures and parking the car.Passport control - My passport NEVER works in the automated arrival gates and I use the airport many times a year. When I inform the staff who push you down the route, they ignore me, then ask me to 'come out' in a snotty manner. Why don't they believe me. Incidentally, my passport works at other automated passport areas at airports in Europe and the USA.",4
2925,The hassle and worry of leaving your vehicle is removed. Having used this system once it will be even easier next time.,4
2926,"Check your car very carefully on returning from holiday especially when arriving home in the dark, a friend came back to meet and greet only to find his car with a damaged mirror and mind had a famed door.",3
2927,"Excellent airport, good layout, easy to find your way around, staff helpful.",5
2928,The outgoing security check needs to be made quicker and the incoming passport check similarly.  More staff required.,4
2929,used terminal 1 multi storey car park. have used before as I understood to be secure.Returned to find car had been ransacked.  told by two staff a blocker may have been used. Police implied I left car unlocked and understandably had not the time to check any CCTV if there was any.So do not leave anything of value and manually check doors before leaving.Cannot find out how many cars are broken into at this car park. but seems a problem that they do not want known.Seen this has happened to others recently,1
2930,once at car park all very easy to use and get to terminal building.,5
2931,"No CCTV in the car park, you are paying for a car park and nothing else, my car and several others were broken into. GMP were really good and very helpful.",1
2932,"Manchester Airport is a very poor advert for overseas visitors. It is a long way behaind airports at similar cities across europe in terms of the building and it's layout and facilities. It is scruffy, old, cramped and generally in need of a total overhaul",3
2933,"Easy to use meet and greet every time i have used it, don't use anything else now",5
2934,Very friendly efficient staff made the whole process an easy one,5
2935,First time we've used the airport car park and was great.,5
2936,4.5 stars - Manchester Airport continues to improve,4
2937,Very professional and efficient service by the staff making parking stress free.,5
2938,Excellent service.  Very efficient.  Staff very friendly.,5
2939,The smoking area is a total disgrace - dirty and no seats.,2
2940,Meet and Greet is really brilliant. A short walk to the terminal. Efficient and friendly staff.Really good value for money,5
2941,Easy friendly service. Highly recommend😃,5
2942,"A very good car park, friendly, helpful staff, and close to the depar5ures area. No hanging around for buses...",5
2943,Other than going through security our experience  was good.,4
2944,"good, do with more buses",4
2945,"The worst ever experience at the Jet 2 security hall. Unacceptable. Over crowded, chaotic, lanes closed at peak time... security staff working in isolation not as a team...",1
2946,"Manchester Airport s getting too big for its own good. Passport control and Security checks are a nightmare unless you buy priority pass. Its such a shame to think that not 5 years ago it was possibly one of the quickest and easiest airport to go through in Europe. The introduction of e-gates has actually slowed down the passport checks, just imagine what it is going to be like after Brexit......",3
2947,Airport service and parking were first class.  Be prepared for weather if needing to wait for bus to transfer from car park to terminal.  Also add extra time in case your terminal is not the first stop your bus makes.,5
2948,Great airport highly recommend multi-storey car park,5
2949,"Used the early bag drop the night before which is a godsend. Meet and greet parking is excellent. Overall a fair experience, but the security staff need a lesson in friendliness and understanding whilst performing their duties.",5
2950,Airport now not big enough to cater for all the passengers using it.,3
2951,"The place is a mess. Poor signage to identify pre-booked car parks. Terminal building, particularly on arrival, feels like an industrial building.",1
2952,"Good carparks, easy to use at a reasonable price.Just bear in mind that at the moment there is a lot of building work going on around the airport and the signposting for the individual carparks isn't the best. I was parked in JP2 and arrived at 4am and it took me a little while to work out where the entrance to the car park was.",4
2953,"A fairly tired airport, but well run and quick to pass through, which has to be priority #1.",4
2954,Arrival experience is absolutely dismalUp and down stairs through horrible corridorsLong delays getting baggage,2
2955,"T3 seems to be the terminal everyone forgot to update.  The route to the multi-story is convoluted and one of the lifts was broken, it feels crowded and security for fast track passengers is nothing more than queue jumping.",3
2956,Don't make a mistake by leaving anything? You most likely won't get it back,2
2957,Excellent service at a great price will use every time. Takes the pressure off finding your car after a long flight very satisfied customer,4
2958,"Used the jetpark ringway Service, easy to find from instructions. Entrance to car park via number plate recoginition, car park of a good size with plenty of spaces however it was out of season. My tip would be take a photo of your bus stop so you know where you parked your car, it definitely helped me!",5
2959,Easy simple start to our holiday,5
2960,Meet and Greet is a seemless experience which I've used many times. It makes the journey start in a positive manner and also provides peace of mind when returning to Manchester.,5
2961,Car parks easy to use (T3 Multi-Storey). No hassle getting or out - simple reg number recognition.,4
2962,Meet and greet was fantastic well worth the experience will book every time  I use Manchester airport to,5
2963,Well sign posted clean with cheerful staff. Recommended.,5
2964,A convenient way to get to and from the airport with the satisfaction that the carpark is secure,5
2965,"cost effective, good access, will use again",4
2966,"Friendly and helpful staff,clear signage and plenty of food outlets",5
2967,The multi-storey is well worth the extra cost.,5
2968,great place to leave great place to come back to,5
2969,Can't fault. Met all expectations.,5
2970,Very convenient parking with easy access to the terminal;,5
2971,"Sometimes difficult with wheelchair passenger when getting on and off the aircraft, never been able to use the equipment that Manchester have for getting the passenger on and off the aircraft, they state no one available who can use equipment, always have to take my own lifting sling to get my son onto the aircraft, then he has to be man handled and they don’t always sent personal capably to lift him this at times holds up other passengers boarding the flight and can be quite upsetting when everyone is stareing at him. He is a 34 yr old and the experience can be uncomfortable for him, when checking in assist they can see the size of him, so should inform staff what will be required.",4
2972,"If paying extra for Meet and Greet car park expect the driver’s seat to have been significantly adjusted, distance from steering wheel (understandable), height and tilt. Not welcome at 7.00 am after a 9 hour flight and going straight to work.",3
2973,Great service and very easy parking experience,5
2974,"Drove in two different places first got charged in one car park, even thou we entered and exited. Found it hard to find a space.",3
2975,Focus more on customer satisfaction as a priority by improving the following:Well signed and illuminated Car Parks with electronic notice boards showing available spaces a must on open car parking.Stop offering Extra Charge FAST LANES and focus on making existing Security / Passport Control more efficient.,3
2976,I always pay the extra and park in the multi storey.  No one else has access to my car.  Entering and exiting the car park is done via number plate recognition so very easy.  A lift direct to departures takes only a few minutes.  No waiting for buses or other assistance have to be relied on.  I find it very easy and quick. Definitely recommend.,5
2977,Finding signs for Jet Parks Ringway was impossible.,3
2978,This service is excellent and very easy to use I would recommend it to everyone,5
2979,"Roadworks at Manchester airport cause confusion with the signpost system, more signs needed while roadworks continue to make directions more clear.",3
2980,"Booking and parking was smooth. My only gripe is the length of time we have had to wait for the Terminal buses on the last two trips. This may be due to the construction going on but waiting 40 minutes on one occasion was not pleasant in the bitter cold. We will give benefit of the doubt because on previous occasions, pre the construction, the service has been excellent.",4
2981,Seriously easy to use just as your stressing over flying. Multi Storey is more preferable than the outdoor longstay.,5
2982,Great experience and easy step by step instructions.,5
2983,"Everything fine until you need to drive out of car park, lack of exit signage, in the dark its worse.",3
2984,"Airport experience once inside the terminal okay apart from the extremely cramped chaos in security control. However, trying to find Jetparks Ringway was an absolute nightmare due to its location not being shown on ANY road signs, not even off the adjacent Ringway Road. Luckily I asked for directions off a pedestrian who knew where it was otherwise I would never have found it. Not everyone has Satnav or can use a smartphone while solo driving.",1
2985,"Manchester Airport - the place you go to remind yourself how much worse your life could be!Roadworks on entry/exit with no info (either before or upon arrival - don't they know people have planes to catch?); Car Park is halved whilst they dig  a little hole; Layout like a puzzle (go upstairs to come back down EVERY time you get off a plane); Low ceilings so the heating & ventilation give you have 2 options: Too hot or too cold. There is no feeling of space anywhere due it not being ""designed"", simply cobbled together with spare parts. The one star is for the slight improvement in baggage handling that has improved over the last 2 years - well done, you're now only about half an hour behind the rest of the world!",1
2986,"As far as the parking goes, excellent, straight forward and value for money. Just be aware of the nightmare roadworks going on right now! NOT THE FAULT OF THE PARKING COMPANY I might add but none the less just take it into account when traveling.",5
2987,Online booking ecxvellent,5
2988,"easy to use, can be busy at securuty",5
2989,"great facility, cost effective and easy/quick to use",5
2990,Great parking facility right outside the terminal,5
2991,Good overall experience only downside waited forever for cases on return and when we got them one was soaking wet due to snowfall and rain they must’ve dropped it in a puddle it was dripping wet through,4
2992,Good experience overall but surly and rude security staff - every time!,4
2993,"We always use Manchester Airport Parking, we drop our car off and they find a parking space for us. No hassle and close to the terminal entrance.",5
2994,"Airport looks outdated and small. airport needs upgrade, enlargement.",3
2995,Fast friendly service. Easy to use and find the car park. Would recommend.,5
2996,Looks very very poor when you have just come from a modern airport like Dusseldorf,3
2997,"Every thing worked well staff great, just untidy and too much litter.",4
2998,"Had a good experience, apart from the roadworks and the signs to get to the jetparks 3",4
2999,Great airport avoid any airline using Menzies as an agent - dreadful,4
3000,"Generally a well organised airport, processing from car park to departures quickly.I love the vehicle reg recognition to enter and exit car parks and can recommend booking in advance. The car parks can be very full though so a better system for locating a space is needed",4
3001,"Car park was fine, a little tricky to find due to road works etc. Bus driver on return journey was so miserable. Drove ridiculously fast causing our cases to be tossed around the bus!",2
3002,Long Stay car park web site recorded my exit time as 5am when i had entered 11pm.I was charged £20 for exiting around 10pm,3
3003,Can’t fault at all. Highly recommend.. very helpful and pleasant staff.,5
3004,"Great  fast and efficient service , cheaper than parking in the terminals ,bus drivers are very kind and helpful ,overall a nice hassle free transfer",5
3005,"parking and flying from manchester airport is a pleasure with the minimal of fuss,especially now with jet 2",5
3006,Thank you. I am very happy.,5
3007,"A little less comfortable an experience than usual, but overall good.",4
3008,"Easy, friendly parking service.",5
3009,"Convenient, easy to use and reasonably priced",5
3010,It's an ok airport. Needs more plug sockets in public areas and less pressure selling duty free.,4
3011,Don’t bother with meet and greet. Car was delivered back muddy inside and outside and car was damaged.  Never again!!!!,1
3012,All good. 15 mins from parking car to departure lounge!,5
3013,Just what i expect when travelling abroad,4
3014,i would always recommend manchester airport carparks for ease of location and never any hassle.,5
3015,The best way to park at Manchester airport,5
3016,"Had a slight hiccup when time to pay for the exit, but staff answered the help button straight away and resolved immediately.",4
3017,"Easy to park, regular free bus service between car parks and terminals is brilliant. My only negative was that in terminal three there is a major shortage of seating/tables at the restaurant. There is only one place to eat and only enough seating for about 80-100 people.",4
3018,"So easy to use, very close to main entrance and friendly staff. Will use every time excellent value.",5
3019,"The Meet and Greet experience is easy to use, helpful staff, clear instructions and secure parking for car.  I have used on a few occasions and will definitely use again.",5
3020,"Second time we have used T3 and booked the multi-storey car park. Easy to book, easy to get in & out via ANPR and it is 2 minutes from departures & arrivals. Great. Will be usin again.",5
3021,"Manchester is a reasonably reliable airport, however much of the layout and interior has not changed in decades. The security process has progressively become slower over the years. I have noted on a number of occasions staff shouting orders at customers. My last two trips in January 2018 took between 30 minutes and 1 hour to get through security. Small details such as routing customers with cabin baggage only through the baggage arrival hall causes crowding and frustration. Charging customers £2 to use a baggage trolley is very petty. This demonstrates airport management have more interest in extracting small amount of money from customers rather than improving overall experience. In comparison to German airports, Manchester is very poor. Unfortunately Manchester airport has a monopoly on the North, with only Leeds Bradford, Liverpool and Newcastle as competition. Customers use Manchester because they have little choice, not because it has a good offering.",3
3022,very easy to use would definitely recommend,5
3023,"Scruffy tatty overcrowded, long walks from Check-in to security loads of steps for no apparent reason: needs to be demolished",1
3024,Meet And Greet parking was a really good service. Used Airport Lounge this time because early check in suited this. Find eating and drinking in airport very expensive and overcrowded .,4
3025,Used lots of time it quick easy and affordable .,5
3026,I would recommend this company every time,5
3027,Excellent service and friendly staff at the meet and greet. Just a little confusing trying to find car park entrance from postcode for T3,5
3028,Great service and friendly staff at the Meet & Greet service.,5
3029,lovely airport with everything that you need - helpful staff with a sense of humour.,5
3030,No complaints whatsoever using the parking or departures/ arrivals,4
3031,zzzzzzzzzzz,4
3032,"We have never had any issues parking with Jet Parks..however jet parks 1 car parking surface is in a terrible condition! It’s uneven, pot holes with standing water and flooded areas!! I cannot comment on other car parks!!",4
3033,Excellent location. Very easy and stress free start to our holiday,5
3034,Other than poor signage (on arrival to the airport) during current road works the long-stay parking was a pretty good experience.,4
3035,Multi storey parking at terminal 3 for a short break was excellent,5
3036,Very good overall experience,5
3037,Very good experience except for passport control,4
3038,"Used the jet parks facility for the 1st time on the whole a good experience marred by an out of date website. I booked my parking easily enough got directions to the car park location etc. On travelling to the car park there were extensive road works closing the road that the directions sent me too, It took almost an hour extra to get my car parked and get back to the terminal, a rather stressful start to my journey i could have done with-ought.I also needed to extend the car park stay due to my trip being extended, this i would have liked to do online but was not able too as manage your booking only goes as far as changing dates times before the travel date and no helpful hints as to how, had to make an expensive phone call to the booking center to book an extra few days.",4
3039,Considering the size of the airport the experience we had on this particular day was good,5
3040,"Good location, price and service. Added bonus keeping your keys and being able to walk to terminal if required.",5
3041,Just wish they would properly staff security clearance and Passport control on arrivals..,3
3042,"Departures is a mess of cordons and arrival is disorganisation. Departures was poorly organised and was just a mess of cordon lines  with no clear signs. On return we had paid for fast tracking through immigration, there were signs for the fast track lane but the lane under this was being used by all passengers and the lane being used for fast track passengers was not sign posted and was on the opposite side of the corridor. Looked like some one had put signs up without any thought as to how the flow of passengers would work.",3
3043,Need to improve the time taken to retrieve bags upon landing and T2 meet and Greet return to car needs to be closer to the kiosk as it is with T1 and T3. Room for improvement me thinks.,3
3044,Cheaper than a taxi and ideal to park in multi-storey car park opposite my departure terminal. Am a female travelling alone so keen to be safe.,5
3045,Would definitely recommend,5
3046,"The car park was far better value than getting a taxi, was a covered car park and safe and was located next to the terminal so couldn't have been more convenient.",5
3047,"Very Good ,the best Airport Parking I have ever experienced (M&G 1)",5
3048,"Do not use the meet and greet car park, we used it and out car was damaged. Upon collection of the car due to it being 11pm at night the paint work that had been damaged wasn’t spotted and Manchester airport are not prepared to investigate the matter by looking at cctv as we left the car park without letting them know. Had we have spotted the damage in the poor lighting conditions it would have been reported straight away, it wasn’t until the next day when we seen it in the light of day we realised there was damage done",2
3049,Overall good service but consistent let down by slow baggage reclaim relative to other airports I use.,4
3050,"Security whilst should be taken extremely seriously was what can only be described as a shambles, queuing for over 90 minutes! Meet and greet car park whilst extremely convenient, the way the cars were just abandoned in the lower car park on arrival was disgraceful. There will have been cars damaged by people struggling to get into their cars",2
3051,Alround perfect service,5
3052,Well I had better and worse as always it’s a roll of the dice. Need to train drivers of buses to smile yes I know it a boring circuit  we don’t expect Disney experience but they sure could learn from a trip round their car park.,3
3053,unacceptable changes to security on departure spoiled normal experience,4
3054,The airport is work in progress. Looking forward to the finished product.,3
3055,"Meet and greet was fine when departing into the airport. On return I am informed my car battery was flat. (it's a hybrid, and never had a problem before, or since). Then I go to start my car and find the key broken, but nobody thought it necessary to mention it to me. I rarely comment when requested, but on this occasion anger drives out this review. Unfortunately these guys have a monopoly on onsite parking, and thus they are hard to avoid, but I would if it were possible.",1
3056,"T2 Long Stay car park is a third world experience.1. There is completely inadequate parking width, even for a small car. It is virtually impossible to avoid a car door touching the vehicle next door.2. The signage is poor.3. Roadway and bay markings are worn out, and the surfaces are akin to  rough ground.3. We waited 25 minutes and 20 mins for transfer buses to arrive, when a 10 mins wait is stated.",1
3057,An old airport showing extreme signs of wear and tear and lack of investment. The baggage return is extremely slow and I try to avoid checking anything into the hold to avoid a 30-40 minute wait to collect my baggage. I do not use this airport when I have an alternative.I travel extensively in Europe and this airport is by far my least favorite airport to use.,2
3058,All went very well apart from Ryan Air keeping us waiting on a cold stairs prior to leaving the terminal building to board the plane.,5
3059,Car park was fine i found it with ease bus arrived on time plenty of space aswell. Only thing that could be imrpoved is bit more details on how often the bus arrives and dont forget the bus stop number and park right at the back as they have extended and not many cars there.,4
3060,Good experience but car park booking dates need to be clearer. I thought I'd booked the car park until Jan 26th but this actually meant midnight on Jan 25th so had to pay for an additional day upon leaving the car park.,4
3061,Better signage from baggage area to Meet & Greet.,4
3062,"Current road works (January 2018) at the T1/T3 entrance make leaving the airport very difficult (slow, leave in the wrong direction as signage is poor).  General access from the East of the country is poor and the MARR completion is late.  Temporary closure of T1 security means a long walk to the gates via the cramped temporary security screening area.",3
3063,Great airport! Brilliant service,5
3064,"Easy booking online, well signed at the Airport.  Access/Exit immediate, ample car parking spaces. Would recommend, great feeling leaving the terminal straight to your car.",5
3065,"Used this service many times. Won't use any other. Perfect from the minute you book, until you collect your car again.",5
3066,Seamless journey and parking experiences when we have travelled and used the parking facilities,5
3067,"Great airport, in nearly all regards, but the car park costs are steep, especially at a weekend, (Friday to Monday)",4
3068,For the second time in a row I had difficulty in exiting the car park despite having pre-paid.,3
3069,Straight into the car park. Reg plate read and barrier up.space found near lift then straight to check in.15 minutes later drinking gin and tonic and relaxing.2 weeks later half an hour from arrival to climbing into the car. 40 minutes and home.What more could we want?Keep it up.,5
3070,First class every time we use meet and greet,5
3071,no problems at allchecked in on phone and passed through the system very quickley,4
3072,Dead easy to navigate. Clean and safe. Definitely use this service again,5
3073,"Small & friendly, usually efficient. The only problem I have is having to pay £1 for trolleys !!!",3
3074,"Poor signage within the terminal building to tell you where to go, when entering or leaving, particularly Terminal 1 or this would be 5 stars",4
3075,"Multi story Car Park T3 - exit lanes too narrow and curbs too high - damaged a wheel, despite taking every care.",1
3076,Very good service for T1 meet and grretStaff were excellent Highly recommend this service,5
3077,"Easy access and parking, bus arrived as we walked to the stop.  Bus arrived on our way back after not too long and was a quick journey to the car park. My first time using the Terminal 1 & 3 long stay car park, and it was much quicker to reach than the Jet Park ones, and just as easy.",5
3078,"Very Expensive, Dirty Car Park, Toilets stink and the security staff has a serious attitude problem",2
3079,"good clean hard standing car park. Clean efficient bus to and from airport, at a reasonable price. Would recommend and use car park for future travel.",5
3080,"MANCHESTER AIRPORT I GETTING DATED AND LACK OF SLEVES FOR DIRECT ACCESS TO THE AIRPORT MAKES IT HARD FOR OLDER PASSENGERS  WHEN DISEMBARKING ONTO THE APRON AND HAVING TO WALK LONG DISTANCES WITH ELECTRONIC WALKWAYS VERY SPARSE AND OFTEN NOT WORKING PLUS HAVING TO CLAIM THE STAIRS . THE FAST TRACK IS ALSO A JOKE, I HAVE NOTICED THAT THE FEES GONE FROM £2 UP TO £5.00 AND YOU STILL HAVE TO WAIT AS THERE IS NO SPECIALLY DESIGNATED AREA JUST FOR PROCESSING FAST TRACK PASSENGERS",3
3081,Very close to the Terminal 3. Easy to use!,5
3082,Always my choice as long as its lower cost than a taxi,5
3083,"Briliant service, so easy",5
3084,simple easy to use sevice and great way to start holiday the shuttle service makes it so easy drops you right at terminal door.,5
3085,Sometimes pass through security can take a while... already have delays more than 45m.,3
3086,"Very convenient, reasonable value",5
3087,Online booking system easy to use. Easy access into multistorey car park. Safe and secure parking.,4
3088,When not too busy it’s a great airport but when busy it’s horrible with queues delays and nowhere to sit,3
3089,"Airport is not as clean as it should be, looks vary shabby on arrival and this is the first impression of England for foreign visitors.Also long queue at the digital passport check and a row of staff at kiosks twiddling their thumbs.",3
3090,Good and fast service!Friendly staff.Thanks,5
3091,Queuing needs sorting and better signage when you initially arrive so you know where to go and where to queue,4
3092,Using Manchester airport this time was quicker and easier then previous trips. The airport staff are very helpful and do a great job. Would definately use again.,5
3093,"Car park is easy to use, number plate recognition is great and makes the whole experience very easy to use.",5
3094,Check what you can and can't take as hand luggage before arriving at security to avoid long delays,4
3095,"TERMINAL 3 IS USUALLY BUSY, BUT RARELY GIVES ONE PROBLEMS.",4
3096,Good airport but food and drink expensive ...,5
3097,Easy and quick to get from parking to plane.,4
3098,overall parking made easy but the cost I feel is a little high,4
3099,"I had booked to leave my car at Manchester Airport in January 2018 but due to my car being broken into I was unable to park my car at the airport. Tried to cancel my booking but was told 24 hours notice was needed, I thought this was ridiculous given the circumstances",1
3100,Easy to park regular bus service found my car same as I left it,5
3101,Brilliant very easy to use and followWould recommend,5
3102,"Good experience,and your car is not returned full of mud",5
3103,Very easy to book and very easy on arrival and departure at the car park. Would recommend to friends and family.,5
3104,Very slow baggage reclaim despite the airport being quiet,3
3105,"Passport control and security screening is totally over the top. People walking around and just ordering people around, no courtesy whatever toward customers.",3
3106,"Terminal 3 'Meet & Greet Service' was completely flawless - cannot recommend it highly enough - it really doesn't get any easier to park your car at Manchester. Highly recommended. Do yourself a favour and take the £5.85 'Fastrack Security' option when booking your parking. It's nothing to do with your car - rather it's a quick, fast and simple way to get through the standard airport security checks without faffing about to pay for the dame thing via a machine in the terminal for the same price. Nice little add-on service that adds value to booking with the M&G service. It was -1 degree centigrade and snowing when I arrived back from my trip. I was tired and freezing. Being able to walk out of the Terminal and straight into my car was just the best!",5
3107,"At busy times, security really struggles.",3
3108,"Manchester airport is very well connected with flights to many destinations. But parking is expensive and if bus transfer is involved it might significantly to your travel time. Security in both T1 and T3 can take very long, so arrive on time. Even when you do not need to drop luggage 1.5 hrs before departure is absolutely needed.",3
3109,"Arrival, parking, check in really easy but getting through security is not a pleasant experience (fully understand that it is because of the sheer volume of passengers).",4
3110,Its hard to put your finger on why but i always feel like a nuisance than a valued customer at Manchester airport.Its the little things they fall down on.,3
3111,Very convenient easy access to the airport. short walk,5
3112,Used Meet and Greet T1. Rapid system and efficient. Staff very friendly and polite departing and arriving. Highly recommend d,5
3113,Multi-storey CP used and although when arriving at night the signs not to clear for the ramp entrance found it but disappointed that all Disabled spaces taken up. Prices very competitive for the 3 day stay.Ease of access to Terminal 1 and return.,4
3114,"Great service, fast and efficient service",5
3115,Security is never a pleasurable experience even if we try to make security staff jobs easier by being prepared.,3
3116,generally very good - signage into parking could be better and cleanliness of car park also could improve,4
3117,"Awful, queues, stairs up and down forno reason, old and dirty!",1
3118,"The in car park staff are great and really efficient.  As a regular traveler the number of changes the driver team make is becoming unacceptable.  Every possible seat change is made, air temp, fan settings, radio stations etc.  Change the seat for safety reasons I understand, but leave everything else as is why would I want an internal temp of 16 with full fan speed when the external temp is only 1 degree?",3
3119,When departing terminal 2 on 5th January between 4-7 pm no shops or restraints open? Only 1 pub the smaller or the two (which was jam packed) and a pop up boots and WHSmith open. As a result  had to pay to go into the lounge to recieve something substantial for my our evening meal pre flight.,4
3120,"Very easy to book online and very close to T3 but they put prices up in the holiday season which can be quite expensive, more deals for returning customers",3
3121,"Passport control arrival was really slow which was amazingly frustrating, but the rest of the experience was pretty good. Flew out of terminal 3 which was clean and easy to move through. Security was fast and thorough as well which was appreciated.",4
3122,"worth the extra charge, especially in winter,not having to get on transport to other car parking areas.",5
3123,Why are airport disabled parking bays smaller than the recognised norm and why does it cost £17.00 for a small English breakfast ?,3
3124,Jetparks car parking is efficient and reasonably priced - bus transfers are regular but remember to make clear note of your car parking allocation and particular care to identify the directional signage as you arrive since there are lots of roadworks at the moment and if you miss the turning you will have to go back onto the motorway and approach again,4
3125,"well sign posted,easy to get from a to b.reasonably priced shops",5
3126,very good and easy,4
3127,"I use the MultiStorey at the terminal every time I leave the country, and it's brilliant.",5
3128,"The airport has improved over recent times but the security procedures, whilst clearly necessary, are still a little chaotic. More security gates would be an advantage to cut down on queues. The variety of food on offer at terminal 1 is fairly good and the Meet & Greet car parking procedure was excellent. I would not hesitate to use the airport again.",4
3129,"Going out fine, coming back slow",4
3130,Busy Airport with good facilities.Not the most glamorous looking compared to many of our EU neighbours but maybe this is because it was established long ago.  Would be nice to have the same visual experience on arrival to Manchester as departing from our EU neighbour airports.  Staff at Manchester all seem polite and helpful.,4
3131,"Considering the amount of building work and expansion going on, still a relatively quick and easy airport to use. Recommend extra time to navigate the roadworks just outside the airport!",3
3132,"Grotty and disorganised. Foreign airports, even in third world countries, put it to shame",2
3133,"A bit full; walkways in T1; customs hall in T1 too small and rarely do all automatic barriers work so invariably a crowd if more than 1 aircraft has arrived. If you pay for Customs fast track, rarely are the customs agents alive to a fast track passenger in the line meaning the fast track experience is severely diluted.",3
3134,Just great service as it should be Many thanks Paul,5
3135,"Great experience from driving into airport, to driving home. Easy to find way around, helpful polite staff and they make the experience good. I travel frequently and strongly recommend Manchester Airport.",5
3136,Should be no charge for picking up passengers.,4
3137,"Peace of mind,Simple booking, ease of use & secure.",5
3138,"Horrible security staff at departures make leaving from this airport a nightmare. They make you feel rushed and stressed, they are rude and it makes for an awful start to any trip. Give this a miss and try Liverpool or Bradford/Leeds which also provide cheaper on-site parking.",1
3139,"Very poor temporary car parking arrangements at Terminal 2; not fit for purpose during wet weather.  Poorly lit, flooded, and badly served in terms of too few bus stops.",2
3140,"Excellent service and only drawback is I always get stopped at security, occupational hazard I suppose.",5
3141,Used this car park very recently. Had read some criticism. I personally found this to be excellent value for money. The staff were very professional and the facilities clearly laid out. I can not understand why anyone would criticise.I will use this service again.,5
3142,Easy to book... the directions send you the long way round to the car park entrance but still OK.. close to terminal.. easy access and departure.,5
3143,great airport with great choice of flights and easy to use,5
3144,"Rip off for parking some months and security is a joke, even with fast track.I visit lots of different airports and Manchester is not one of the best",3
3145,"An excellent overall experience, great location (multi-story Terminal 3); major aggravation is out of car park's control - the road works around the airport. Leave time to wander around the car park to find vacant slots - we always automatically go to the top deck as there is always room there.",4
3146,Baggage could be faster.   But this complaint can be applied to any of the bigger airports.,4
3147,Meet and greet parking is quick and efficient at all terminals both going and returning. Minor problem at present due to building works outside terminal one finding entrance can cause minor problems,5
3148,"cheaper thn getting a taxi, means I can leave later and get back quicker",5
3149,One of the best Meet & Greet services I have experienced.,4
3150,"Nice airport with a lot of facilities, places to eat, shop and visit.Clean environment with pleasant and helpful staff",5
3151,Usually have a great experience not this time however. I changed my car in the period between pre-booking and flying so obviously had a different reg. I rang the helpline the day before flying to alter the details. I was told I'd done the right thing as you couldn't change details online the day prior to flying.I thought it was odd when I arrived and the machine prompted me to take a token. Thinking back it was obvious then that the NPR system hadn't recognised my new Reg. On my return when trying to leave the car park the machine asked me for £120 parking fees. Fortunately I had my booking details with me and was able to sort it out with the Guy on the end of the car park intercom. He told me that the system hadn't been updated with the changes which was annoying after I had specifically made a point of phoning up to advise of the changes.Disappointing because I normally have no problems with this service.,3
3152,Great online service with good offers,5
3153,"secure,good and stress free, free transfer bus to the terminals and back!",4
3154,Car park service was good but the car was filthy when we picked it up so goodness knows where it was parked whilst we were away! Staff too busy to be nice,4
3155,"Great experience and service, would highly recommend.",5
3156,Current 'improvements' to airport mean that access to the Long Stay car park (T2) is greatly compromised and badly signposted. There is no warning of this issue during the booking of the car park process.,3
3157,Spaces in the car park can be a little tight but overall really good.,4
3158,"Good clean, safe airport. Everything is clear and easy to navigate your way through. There are plenty of seating areas and good shops if you get bored (and who doesn't). All you need when travelling is here.",5
3159,"Parking, check in, security , lounges all good especially Terminnal one and two.",5
3160,Not bad airport but can improve the seating area to make it user friendly and more comfortable. Felt like been in a bus station,4
3161,"Overall average experience. Very dissapointed to find that after leaving our car with meet and greet, to find and extra 80 miles on the clock, seat had been altered and someone had been using my car to drive around in!",3
3162,So easy to book online-access to the carpark also very good.,5
3163,"Great connection with Manchester City Centre, Safe and well controlled place",5
3164,Always pre book parking (either multi story or meet & greet) and always a first class experience.,5
3165,"Just need to improve flow through passport control, then all good",4
3166,"Car access to terminal 3 is disrupted by major roadworks necessitating a diversion.  The road used for the diversion was reduced to one lane by other roadworks, with a resulting massive queue.  The lights controlling access from this road to the dual carriageway also have a very short pattern for access from the diversion - more queuing.  I'd avoid driving there until this is fixed, but the train service is unreliable as well.",2
3167,"Easy way to park your car for all terminals, short walk to and from terminal building, secure and cost efficient",5
3168,"Manchester airport is my local airport, and as such I feel comfortable flying from there all the time, totaling many flights to date.  My main gripes are, 1. immigration when returning back to the UK is very slow.   The staff are efficient however. there's just not enough of them.  Also when arriving and passing through the airport corridors the place seams drab and unwelcoming unlike other larger airports I pass through.  Manchester is a great airport, and has my loyalty.  But it's basic to say the least, I'm sure the rebuild will be good however in the future.  Finally the road system around the airport is confusing.  Motorway access however is good.  Finally don't like being hassled to buy a ticket to win a car.  Every time I walk past they grab you in the terminal.",4
3169,"Meet and greet at terminal 1 is an excellent car parking facility, easy to use and helpful staff.",5
3170,Easy to find & easy to use. Straight in to the car park & quickly out when leaving. Would recommend.,5
3171,Great service  and a nice place to use nothing and out of the country,4
3172,Good service - Friendly staff .,5
3173,frequent flyer and security is overkill intrusive and 40-50% unnecessary..,2
3174,Old and needs a major revamp. Dirty toilets and dirty bar areas. Arrogant staff in bars and lounges and also in security.,2
3175,Great location.  Smooth and efficient transition.  Our go to car park. Would recommend.,5
3176,"Manchester scannnig area was a fiasco with some rude and obnoxious staff. Birmingham staff are much nicer -  manchester needs to learn from Birmingham, it doesn't take much to be human and friendly.",3
3177,"Very easy and simple to access, comfortable and clean with all services and shops for all prices..I am comparing with an experience of using several times for work and leisure, airports of Oporto(my country), Lisbon, Casablanca,  Tunis, Paris,Frankfurt, Geneve, London Gatwick.",5
3178,"All airports are horrible! So much wasted time, expensive food and always stodge, very little salad/fruit availability. Why does one have to show one's boarding pass when purchasing anything? I couldn't have got as far as, say, W H Smith or Boots without one!",3
3179,Quick easy always use this service,4
3180,"Over priced, but all other aspects booking, arrival and pick up etc straight forward and seamless.",4
3181,"Overall experience better in January than various dates in July and August.Departure areas are too overcrowded especially bars/restaurants, no seats at all.  No alternative but to book into lounges.",4
3182,A positive experience all round..great stuff,5
3183,"With really easy access to the airport - plenty of parking, I find it really useful.  Mostly I can get through security and into departures relatively quickly.and have time to grab a coffee before my flight.  The only downside is the usual queue for Costa!",5
3184,"Found it very stressful going through security as a diabetic carrying insulin pens. In a sealed box told they had to be split down to fit in a sealed plastic bag then taken off me and put in a different tray and taken away I had no idea where they would reappear or when. Vital medication and seeing it disappear and not know where to get it back from its stressful and a poor start to the holiday my watch also went missing but did turn up eventually ! Its enough to put you off going abroad. No such hassle on the way back from Finland no issues at all - I think the airport at Manchester goes way over the top , not impressed at all will fly from another airport in future. Also you are forced to trail all through the shops at Terminal 1 before you get to the restaurants, trying to make people spend their money I guess when all you want is a cup of tea!!!",2
3185,"Pretty good, no real,problems",4
3186,Jetpark Ringway car park was good value for money (i.e. cheaper than other car parks). The car park is located fairly close to the airport but bit tricky to find due to the road works going on in the area. The main negative point in this experience was the poor bus service. The bus driver was very unhelpful / unfriendly.,3
3187,"It's such a dump. It's like landing in the 20th century. You have to pay for your trolley, you have to pay to weigh your bag. They just want your money, they don't see you as customers who they want to please. I use it because of its location but it's an embarrassment for Northern England.",1
3188,"Great, no stress experience and a great start to our holiday!",5
3189,Excellent car park service efficient and pleasant staff.,5
3190,Easy to use no problems whatsoever. The barrier recognised my car reg going in and coming out so everything ran smoothly!,5
3191,Car park experience stressful - no guidance on where to park or where the free spaces are so you drive around for a long time looking for spaces. Some cars had parked in verges and not in allocated spaces. One car had parked and obstructed our bus causing delays - very stressful! Airport difficult to navigate around - unclear where to check in. Had to wait in crowds for lifts to check in desks - where were the steps?? Not enough staff to help with electronic check in which kept going wrong. I would not choose to fly from this airport again unless it was the only option.,1
3192,Always good and easy when going back home,5
3193,Exiting the T2 mutistorey carpark at 8pm. on Saturday 13Jan was the  biggest shambles i have ever experienced in my entire motoring career!! Hundreds upon hundreds of cars entering the parking to pick up arriving passengers!!  and you did not bother to respond to my review. Terrible,3
3194,"Manchester airport is a tired and tatty place, full of tacky fruit machines",2
3195,"Too big ,  too buisy ,  expensive to pick up or drop off friends ....personally prefer smaller more local northern airports!!",3
3196,Have always used this with complete satisfaction until this time. Our car was left with a large scratch on the right wheel arch. We were tightly parked next to a large white pillar in T2 car park opposite the exit. White paint all over the scratch! ...,2
3197,"The meet & greet experience was a first timer. Everything worked perfectly. Friendly, efficient and obliging staff left us reassured and relaxed once we had left the car.",5
3198,problems upon return with passport control and waiting over 1hour at baggage reclaim,3
3199,"As airports go, it is a good airport.",5
3200,Check in is pretty quick and friendly staff.,5
3201,"I have used this car park a few times easy access freindly staff, a very short walk to the airport.",4
3202,"Good parking and airport facilities, straight off the motorway, no hassle",5
3203,Great service and would have no hesitation in recommending.,5
3204,"Car parking and checking in all OK, but passport control and baggage collection could be improved",3
3205,Would have been 5 stars if it wasn't for the poor previous experience of concierge parking at Terminal 2 in 2017... Terminal 3 is obviously the standard that the operators of this facility should aspire to.,4
3206,"Had a fairly good experience, was let down by the immigration control side not very helpful (they need to know that not everyone travels every day and knows their rules inside out). other than that queues on arrival back",4
3207,"Excellent - staff friendly, easy to find car park, dropping off car and picking up car very easy.  Would recommend this car parking facility to everyone.",5
3208,Meet and greet is a superb service more convenient and less expensive than using a taxi.  Staff are polite and always helpful.,5
3209,"Great long stay car park at a reasonable price, easy access & exit",5
3210,Security worked hard to keep the queue under control and there were enough seats to go round in the terminal even tough it was busy (with all the people who had given themselves an extra hour to get through security and passports!).,4
3211,"I booked my car into the multi storey car park which was perfectly located for my departure. I was travelling alone and navigating the airport was hassle free, apart from airport security which is very time consuming so make sure you allow plenty of time for this process",5
3212,"Only downside is the abrupt and over officious attitude of some of the security check personnel, they don't seem to realise that it is not a pleasant experience for travelers to undergo.",4
3213,"Paid £115 for 11days parking, I missed my flight home and was then charged an extra £150 for three extra days ?????",4
3214,"Easy to book, great value, very efficient service.",5
3215,Good car park experience. Close to terminal.,3
3216,"An excellent experience with the exception of the car parks, which are a nightmare to find, dependant upon which you choose. The amount of road works around the airport with little or no clear signage does not help at all.",4
3217,"The worst  International airport in the world! It's old, has poor facilities, too small and can't cope with the number of passengers using it. it needs to be knocked down and start again.",1
3218,easy to park fast to departure and arrival,5
3219,"V. easy to use, well signposted to meet and greet, friendly and helpful staff.",5
3220,"good, covered parking extremely close to T2 at a reasonable price.  Would recommend and will use again",5
3221,Easy use of long stay car parking,5
3222,Excellent experience,5
3223,"Only use if no alternative - poor signage and directions, long waits for buses and bus stops not clearly visible in car park",1
3224,"Easy to book online , parked up and was out of office quickly , on arrival back was in and out within 10 mins overall very pleased with service",5
3225,Very good Airport and car parking at cease for a change,5
3226,Excellent Way to park,5
3227,"Simple booking service, and easy to find.",4
3228,Great airport just beware of delays going through security,5
3229,Lovely Staff and very efficient service,5
3230,"Meet and Greet a fantastic service, so easy to amend booking at last minute.",5
3231,"No worries, hassle a pleasurable experience thank you!",4
3232,"Good access, easy check in, highly recommended",5
3233,"Manchester & the 21st CenturyManchester airport needs to bring its self into the 21st century when compared with most aspects of many other major European airportsSecurity check is a nightmareAir side ground staff don't attend to aircraft in a timely manor, which can cause a 20 minute delay disembarking...great experiance",2
3234,"A busy but efficient airport, clean and comfortable, plenty of information.",5
3235,"The airport is reasonably efficient and travelling through is relatively painless (I was using terminal 1). But the flow of people through terminal 1 can be confusing and congested, with arriving and departing passengers competing for space in the same lifts (which service the airport building and the short stay car park at the same time).Visual impression: the place needs a good clean and regular maintenance and updates because it always looks scruffy, dowdy and dirty. Typical UK airport really.",3
3236,"Easy, handy for the terminal (Car park 1), will use again.",4
3237,its improving but the security experience is a hell,3
3238,"Poor T3 car park signage,Poor (slow) security, Poor immigration procedure - slow with dozy staff.",2
3239,Very easy to use from start to finish. No waiting around for your car upon returning to airport.,5
3240,Ease of use. I will use again,5
3241,"Smooth service, just what you need when you have a 2 year old, a pram and lots of bags!!!!",5
3242,I am sure the car parks will be ok once all the construction work has finished,4
3243,"GenerallyCant find faults. We use Manchester Airport a lot, the only thing I would say at moment is a warning of Road closure around Airport to Jetparks 3, lack of signs after diversion sign causing difficulty, DO do a dummy run IN DAYLIGHT, and watch aircraft landing as this carparkis nr end of runway, and this is a good guideline to the carpark, but more signs through the housing and streets would be better. W e had used Jetparks3 previously but still had difficulty , we watched the aircraft landing, we did a dummy run in Daylight prior to hotel stay as in the dark it would have been a nightmare, travel date 1/1/18",5
3244,Finding car park wasn't easy overall experience was easy,4
3245,"Close to the terminal, easy to park and collect car using pre-payment, car park tidy and well kept.",4
3246,First class every time we have used it and that`s quite a few times,5
3247,"Pretty easy to use all round, better than most airports",4
3248,"I have used Meet&Greet every time, i Fly from Manchester Airport and you cannot fault them . The service is excellent and i shall be using them every time.",5
3249,"Baggage drop off took over an hour. Security took over an hour. Thought we’re going to miss our flight, staff didn’t care. On returning to manchester, we disembarked the plane only to be stopped while another plane had to board, staff were very ungrateful and didn’t apologies for our inconvenience caused.",2
3250,"Easy to find, didn’t wait long for the bus transfer, the drivers are very helpful and friendly, will be using the service again",5
3251,A1 1stclass Will use again,4
3252,Book on-line.Pick your dates and car park.Great price.Turn up and drive straight in.Find a space.Get on the bus to the terminal.Have a great holiday.Get on the bus to your car park.Get in your car and drive away.It doesn't get much easier.Would recommend to family and friends.,5
3253,Easy to find and easy access with automatic barrier. The only negative point is the shortage of disabled bays.,5
3254,Easyjet bag drop is a nonsense. Do it yourself is OK with patient support but not with supercilious young women who didn't help 70 plus year olds.More redundancies?,3
3255,Had a Excellent time at the airport parking was excellent staff where great,5
3256,Fantastic. Easy safe and convenient. Real value for money,5
3257,Use the meet and great so much easier when arriving back in the country,5
3258,"Very easy to use and, though it pains me to say it, much cheaper than the train.",4
3259,Was early hours and we were greeted warmly and everything ran smoothly from entry to exit,5
3260,"Unfortunately we were delayed and then had to arrive into a different terminal, the car park attendant offered to move our vehicles to the new terminal and they were all there ready when we arrived. Such an efficient and friendly / helpful service.  We would highly recommend using the meet and greet service.",5
3261,"Easy, used a number of times, no issues.",5
3262,"Excellent service from start to finish, very pleasant staff!Security fast track excellent, but passport control fast track very poor, a waste of £10.00 for me and my Wife, with an abrupt passport woman thrown in for free!!",5
3263,Overall we were very satisfied from arriving At The Car park to departure.,5
3264,"Excellent parking - easy, safe, plenty of spaces and extremely close to airport.",5
3265,Good experience overall parking through to Airport.. all good..,5
3266,Please make sure you take responsibility for checking what you are allowed in your hand luggage and how it should be packed to save long queues at security...so frustrating and really no excuse!,4
3267,This is the best car park service at Manchester by far ..book your vehicle in fir a valet at £29 absolute bargain an come home to a nice clean smelling car with a first class service ..will always use plus your car don't get took on joy rides like the rogue ones do,5
3268,Convenient with a decent rail link. Departures is fine but arrivals can be a faff. Automatic passport desks only opened when the queue has already developed. Baggage collection is mayhem,4
3269,"Manchester airport Meet & Greet offer a great, convenient service and it's super easy to book, park and for the return pick-up of vehicle.",5
3270,"Meet and GreetWas a little worried about using the meet and greet as there had been some negative press in relation to the service.  I needn't have worried as it was great. Friendly staff and easy to locate the car when we returned home, would recommend this service to anyone.",5
3271,Another good experience of using the multi storey car park.,4
3272,Everything is well signed and flows well.The car park is easily accessible and the overall place is well kept.,5
3273,"Outdated, overpriced and with dirty toilets. Will use only if no other option available. Quality of service provided is way below in comparison to other international airports.",1
3274,Easy and stress free start to the holiday!,4
3275,"Smelly toilets, dated signage, shonky number plate recognition in carpark. Overpriced victuals - undoubtedly no different to any other British airport.",3
3276,"Terrible airport. Staff really unfriendly, uncomfortable. A totally miserable start to any holiday",1
3277,"The staff were extremely helpful, the professionalism of the staff made the experience was very easy and I would highly recommend your service to all of my friends and family.",5
3278,"Recently used Gatwick near London, now i really appreciate Manchester.Gatwick was depressing and boring and full of miserable people.Makes me fully appreciate my home town airport.Manchester you rock",5
3279,Straightforward process. Staff lovely and so close to terminal.,5
3280,Excellent servicesWould highly recommend,5
3281,Great - easy to use,5
3282,"Easy from beginning to end - booking was simple, parking and transport to and from the terminal was quick and stress free and leaving was as simple as pulling up to the barrier and driving out, no having to find a crumpled ticket or token. Would definitely use again.",5
3283,easy to park with regular bus transfers. didn't have an problems getting through departure process even though I haven't travelled abroad for several years.,5
3284,Definitely be using again and recommending to family and friends,5
3285,"I have completed your f survey, so requiring this extra stuff is irksome and I do NOT appreciate it.",3
3286,Lace broke scratched,5
3287,I give 3 stars because my car was full of mud inside when I returned to receive it. In general my overall experience exept for that was good.,3
3288,"Booked meet & greet parking service, made life so much easier at the airport. Not much messing around to leave or collect the car and so much quicker than the ones where you have to get a bus to the car parks! Would definitely recommend and will definitely use again in the future",5
3289,Easy parking and very handy no waiting around,5
3290,Cattle travel better,2
3291,"No Space in car park, no clear signs and no receipt provided when you book online for T1.",1
3292,No problems.Clear instructionsNo undue waiting,5
3293,"No other airport experience comes close to what we experienced at Manchester, ease of parking and close proximity of meet and greet T3 to check in is unbelievable. This will be car park of choice in the future.",5
3294,I would really rate this service x very efficient.,5
3295,"Normally fine, but there can be long delays for security when leaving, and too many stairs and long queues for passport control when arriving.  There's also quite often congestion getting to the airport, and the buses to and from the long stay car parks could be more frequent.",3
3296,could be better compared to other international airports,3
3297,THE AIRPORT MEET AND GREET IS A GREAT SERVICE AND WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND,5
3298,"Snow on the ground, freezing cold but the car park bus service still carried on working. Helpful drivers and especially kind and considerate members of staff in the control room, when I made the silly mistake of getting the 24 hour clock wrong. I think the price charged is OK and I am definitely going to use Manchester Airport Car Parks the next time I travel.",5
3299,Car parking for meet & greet is excellent Security is a pain but is needed,5
3300,"AIRPORT EXPERIENCE  FAIR.CAR PARKING A NIGHTMARE, NUMBER PLATE RECOGNITION VERY VERY POOR.TOOK OVER 20 MINUTES TO EXIT,  BARRIER WOULD NOT LIFT TO ALLOW EXIT and NO RESPONSE FROM THE INTERCOM.",2
3301,Travelling experience through T2 Manchester was a pleasure and hassle free. Pre booked Car Parking is so easy and highly recommended.,5
3302,"Usually the Meet and Greet parking is very good, used it several times with no issues. Very easy. However woe betide you having an emergency and having to cut short your holiday.  There is no easy way to contact the parking team to advise them of your earlier arrival online via your booking ref, you cannot change it.  Nor is there any direct emergency contacts.  For T1 we had to get family to call them several times and stress the urgent nature, less we'd have been stuck at the airport late at night with an ill person for hours, whilst they got our car!  Have info'd the team and hope they sort this issue out.  The T1 exit to the motorway is also poor, as is the meet and greet directions for entry to the airport.",3
3303,Car parking at Manchester airport is hassle free and easy to use with good bus service to the terminals,5
3304,"Overall always a very good experience, thankyou",5
3305,Fantastic service great start to my family holiday thanks to all staff at manchester airport,5
3306,"Meet and Greet has altered my parking behaviour. Yes it is more expensive than Park and ride. But using for business or holidays with two small children, it is so convenient. Cost wise it is worth it too. The staff are competent and friendly and picking up your car after leaving the arrivals hall could not be easier!",5
3307,We were delayed by 3/4 hour due to my wife’s case being rejected in scanning- this was after warnings from the security staff that we would be delayed by an hour if we got our packing wrong- the offending article was a small travel clock! If the airport is to threaten passengers with delays for improper packing then it should at least avoid errors on their part. Security is paramount but If the technology is not reliable they should employ more staff to manually check rejected cases rather than subject their customers to unnecessary delays- this is only logical and reasonable,2
3308,As always Travelling made as easy as possible,5
3309,"Old airport, facilities and especially luggage claim service must be improved. Area for luggage reclaim was extremely busy and crowded. Luggage arrived late despite the fact that they had the priority label on due to business class.",3
3310,Excellent! Multi storey parks next to the terminal are great value for money and so much more convenient.,5
3311,we would highly recommend no problems what so ever,5
3312,This is the 1st time used the airport's meet & greet service and it will be the only service I use from now on. For years I have used private meet & greet services which was never a problem but then the inevitable happened and got let down while sat at departures and ended up having to use a carpark at last minute so I could catch my flight and from that moment I vowed never to use a private company again.The Airport's meet & greet service was very easy to use and have very friendly staff the overall service was suburb and I would recommend to anyone looking for a meet & greet service.,5
3313,Quite hard to find as there's no signs. Good location for terminal 3 !,5
3314,Spot on....a remarkably  smooth experience....I never imagined it would be so easy.,5
3315,Multi storey at T1 is very convenient but expensive.,4
3316,I made a mistake on a long haul flight and inserted my return date incorrectly.  I only realised the day before I was going so had to phone and speak to a representative.  They couldn't have been more helpful and changed my booking so that I didn't have any problems on my return.An excellent service,5
3317,Excellent service both departing and on arrival,5
3318,M&G T1 excellent serviceUsed other car parking in the past but returned to M&G as it's is so smoothly run & they look after your car - top service all round.,5
3319,"No Waiting, No transfers, No worries, just drop off and go and be happy.",5
3320,Can't seem to deal with the number of passengers at peak times.,2
3321,Booking process easy and cost not too bad but more cars looks for spaces than there were available. Spaces not over generous for larger vehicles. No green light indicators in T3 multitude like there is in T1,4
3322,"Okay but security, know it has to be done, needs some better organisation.General appearance of airport is not brilliant having been to other airports abroad.",3
3323,Be careful when you pick up your car!  Ours was damaged but we didn’t see until in the next morning as we collected late at night and it was dark and the car was wet. They said once you leave the gates there is no cover and they are not interested in discussing.  You will need to check car inside and out before you leave as no come back on them.,1
3324,"Good service. Easy to drop off car, easy to pick up afterwards. Very reasonable and the Escape Lounge is excellent. Relaxed, comfortable, good food and drink and much better value than going to one of those expensive airport restaurants",5
3325,The Meet and Greet Car park gives an excellent starting point to the holiday. The rest of the experiemce into the airport is something that has to be endured.,4
3326,Ease of use and position of meet and greet would never use any other method.,5
3327,"Excellent way of pre booking car parking facilities whilst maintaining control of own vehicle. Number plate recognition on entry and exit means no stopping for tickets, no potential lost tickets and no need to find a pay machine before exiting. Stress free",5
3328,"What can I say? I spent about £40 for my car to be parked over 2 weeks. Great value for money, and as 2 of us were flying this time - much, much cheaper than the train. We would have spent near £200 full journey on train tickets if we didn't drive.My car was in one piece, I found a spot easily, I entered/exited easily, the bus to the airport/from was nearly no waiting time, absolutely no problems.This is a great service, and if they don't get greedy with their prices and make excuses to raise them - I would say; continue to use them. No faults, no problems, cheap, affordable parking that is ""sadly"" beating the idea of a train journey in to the ground.Cheers!",4
3329,"Ok. Part of the entrance to the carpark blocked off so made things a bit tricky. Had to park a bit further away than wanted, but overall, not devastating.  There is a bus service but It was quicker to walk than wait in the cold.",3
3330,"Parked in JetParks 1 - this carpark has lots of pot holes and water has nowhere to run off so returning to a waterlogged carpark was a nightmare. Waited  for more than the promised 15 minutes for the bus to arrive (usually not a problem but when it's raining + freezing + kids = not fun). Security is a hit and miss, this time it was not a great experience. Returning, bags took over 45 mins to arrive (after we'd cleared passport control).  Overall unfortunately, not a good experience.",2
3331,"Small but good airport. Stupid concept of paid trolley, it is so embarassing when you see somebody struggling with their baggage because they didn't have UK coins; how does it help attracting tourist to Manchester and around? Some idiot sitting at the top must have come up such idea!",3
3332,"Security!! Slow, cumbersome, inefficient. Half the staff friendly, half unfriendly. No consistency. Takes so long time that afterwards you are so fed up you are not using any other amenities or shops. You just want to get out of the airport!",3
3333,A good hub with good connections.  Easily reached from the motorway network. A good range of food outlets. Allow time for security as it can be busy.  Sometimes there can be delays in receiving bags on arrivals.,4
3334,"My only concern is the cost to use the jet parks. Without the discounts, it’s expensive compared to Liverpool.",3
3335,"Manchester airport seem to go out of their way to make the experience as poor as possible. The road network around the airport is a joke, the security clearance is absolutely disgraceful with long queue's inadequate facilities and the treatment of passengers is like we are cattle.The arrivals experience is just as bad, long queue's to much reliance on automated machines not enough staff.Baggage reclaim is woefully slow with no obvious airport representation in the hall, obviously they do not want to interact with people.All in all it is the worst experience as a ""customer"" i experience at any airport, and i travel often. Avoid it if you can, use regional airports if possible.",2
3336,alot of road works and upgrades going on so signage not upto date,3
3337,"Convenient, safe , reliable service every time",5
3338,Easy to park car in T1 multi storey. Straight to aspire lounge for two hours quiet time only to have some ASBO family think it’s amusing to parade their screaming kid around the lounge then change its nappy on a sofa right in front of everybody else in the lounge. Seats need refurbishing as some of them are badly stained. I wonder why.,3
3339,Slow security check in.... poor shops and restaurants,2
3340,"Parked on airport. Felt safe in the car park and the whole process was easy and quick.  If we had to fly from Manchester again would use the same facility.  As for the airport itself, we didn't find it very welcoming.  We checked in on-line but still had to queue at check in - there was no dedicated bag drop.  Shops were limited as were places to eat.  Take your own food if you have any dietary issues as meat and chips seems to be the order of the day!  Frankie and Benny's saved the day for us as they offered a vegetarian option which we could customise to suit our health needs.",3
3341,Easy entrance and exit. Had to go up to the 4th floor for spaces but otherwise very happy with the price and experience.,5
3342,Would get 5 stars every time apart from the amount of time you have to wait to get your luggage when returning to Manchester . This is why I try fly to Liverpool as much as I can,3
3343,Always use these car parks never had a problem with them not so easy find a space at peak season got to drive around a lot to find one  other than that excellent service highly recommended,5
3344,"Excellent facilities, easy to locate and access",5
3345,"Car parking was easy to book online, discount was accommodating, from booking in to booking out we knew our car would be safe after using this cap park booking each time we go away",5
3346,"We used the meet and greet parking for the first time, it was perfect, very easy and straightforward and good value for money. It was convenient as it was a 1 minute walk from the car to the terminal, would definitely use this again!",5
3347,Excellent  - Would definitely recommend this service to anyone.,5
3348,Security/customs need improving. 50 plus staff off and only 5 out of 10 self passport machines working.,3
3349,Great service to use if you want hassle free parking!,5
3350,OVERPRICED PARKING AIRPORT NEEDS A REFURB,3
3351,No instructions how to get to the bus from jetringway carpark to terminals. Some officer were not helpful at all. Rubbish on the floor and seating places.,3
3352,"I will always fly from the North when I can and find that Manchester is a good sized airport and have never had any real problems with traveling there, parking ad flying. No large delays at security.",4
3353,Used meet and greet was very easy to book on line. very fast and efficient service on arrival and also cheaper than taxi,5
3354,"Manchester Airport is no longer fit for purpose. The check in areas of terminal 1 are cramped as is the whole airport. The baggage security area appeared to be in a large underground dungeon which was dirty and could do with a good clean. If you paid for express passage you never suffered this area. This was manned by rude impatient staff who were over zealous in their treatment of some travellers. Terminal 1 departure lounge is now too small for the amount of travellers. There were people sat on the floor. On return the passport control staff were again rude and over zealous with some passengers, not everybody are seasoned travellers and for some English is not their first language. The exit for travellers in terminal 1 is a nightmare, the waiting area is too small. There are people trying to get to check in. The car park pay machines are right in front of the doors so large queues build up as your trying to exit.",1
3355,Great parking with friendly and approachable staff. Even with all the building work going on the staff couldn't have been more helpful. Will be using again as long as the price is right.,5
3356,"The main problem with MAN airport at the moment are the road works, it feels like you are entering a building site, will be interesting to see how it is when road works are complete!",3
3357,"Everything ran smoothly than expected, cannot fault.",5
3358,Excellent service. Easy to use and short walk to terminal. Just makes travelling so much easier.,5
3359,"Easy directions, access and egress. Will always book meet & greet and have done for numerous years.  The staff are helpful and friendly.",5
3360,Generally clean and efficient with friendly staff but waiting and queues for baggage and at passport control on arrival lets it down,3
3361,Meet & Greet parking was easy to use.  Our car was in a sheltered car park and very secure.  It was also easy to pick up the car when we returned.,5
3362,Really convenient and easy to use.  ANPR makes entry and exit easy.  Spaces could be a little bigger  but otherwise great.,4
3363,"I would recommend anyone to use Manchester airport,its very accessible to everyone.Its very easy to use,very clean and a great place to fly from.But it has two flaws,buying food e.g.breakfast is not good value for money,we don't mind paying more,but it needs to show it,in quantity and quality.The other one is the price of duty free,most of it is cheaper in ASDA.",4
3364,"Generally happy with parking and airport services at Manchester airport. Good bus service from Jetparks, and we got through check in and security pretty quickly.",4
3365,"Stopped the car in the lane advised at the barrier, popped into the cabin and dropped off the key in exchange for a cardboard ticket, went into departures, got on plane, went on holiday. Arrived at 10:30 at night, walked to cabin and exchanged ticket for car key, went to where my now very clean car was parked",5
3366,"very good service, fast and safe",4
3367,Good experience might be different later in the day .,5
3368,"Meet and greet easy to find easy to park and easy to get to departure terminal, collection of car from meet and greet not so good wrong key given to me and car was not there after the right key was found.",4
3369,Very poor directions to car park were send which basically took me round very long way when I was already running late and much easier route directions could have been send. This also made entry through gate difficult as it made me come wrong way.  Car park itself was great but very poor directions to get to it,3
3370,"Manchester Airport has all the facilities a good airport needs matched by staff who know what they are doing. Just wait and see your return flight back here to compare with some appalling waits, queues, facilities and rude staff at other airports abroad!",5
3371,Excellent airport. Wish others were as good,5
3372,Every thing is great except passport control on returning to Manchester terrible every time,3
3373,"Car parking fantastic!Departures? Security staff need to get a personality, very poor attitude",5
3374,"Every time I use this car park the entry system never recognises my registration. This last time I used it the barriers failed completely and after about 10mins a random stranger came out of nowhere and took matters into his own hands and ripped the barriers off, so people could get in. Obviously didn’t want to miss his flight. There are no staff on site so any issues like this are going to take a while to resolve. Although still cheaper than some other airports the price increases of over 50% this year is unjustified. The car park hasn’t changed in a number of years. For most people going on holiday they will have to drive so They know that even if they put the prices up people will have to pay. That is the only justification companies seem to need these days. Saying that, the buses to and from the airport are clean and frequent. In all the times I’ve used the car park my car has never been damaged. I will be using it again, but as the train service to the airport improves I will hopefully use that.",3
3375,Car park got charged twice. Barrier wouldn't open until paid another £92 for 5 days parking. Not manned. Very poor service which I won't be using again,1
3376,excellent experience,4
3377,"Great service as always. So much easier to park at the Terminal and know our car will be there on our arrival back into the UK, ready for us to drive home.",5
3378,"Great car park. Ringway. Was so easy, just pulled up and the barrier lifted up from our reg number. Plenty of spaces (was in December so lot quieter)and the bus pulled straight up. Seemed like a few minutes and we were at the terminal. Great service back aswell, no delays, no problems. Friendly bus drivers. Would definitely do it again. Great value, better than paying over the odds for parking on the airport.",5
3379,Good experiencePleasant and helpful staff,4
3380,Nice experience....see you next time thanks,5
3381,"Excellent location to the terminal, easy to find with helpful and friendly staff.",5
3382,"Meet and GreetUsed this service for many years without incident. Unfortunately this time when I got home noticed a pen mark on the leather panel on my door that was not there before we left the car in thier care. Manchester Airport have refused to even look at the damage caused and decided to hide behind their T+C's which state damage must be notified before you leave the car park. Impossible to do when you are in a poorly lit car park and have to squeeze into your car because your car is parked so close to the next car. Maybe if thier staff told you to check over your car before you leave when they give you your keys and they get decent lights in the car park, we could check our cars before we leave! Don't know where they park the cars but car mats were covered in limestione sludge. Will never use again.",1
3383,"As a regular user of the service I find it very convenient and relative value for money, the staff are excellent and friendly, I always complete the after service survey and always add similar positive comments. I only have one issue....which has never prompted a response, so I will try here.Every time, without fail, I use M&G, whichever terminal, the Automatic Number Plate Recognition..never...never responds and I have to call for help.The staff explain that it is because I have personalised number plates, hardly a rarity, and doesn't affect many other establishments from using it successfully, never a response has come my way. I live in hope and will still use it.",3
3384,The Meet and Greet car parking service at Manchester was brillian made our trip so much easier,5
3385,"Too much hastle at check-in and waiting on departure stairs too long to be safeToo long a wait for baggage on arrivalOthers things ok, but can’t rate higher given experiences above",3
3386,Pre-booked parking in terminal 3 multistory had to move the car several times and the staff did not seem to have a clue about which areas where valid for me to park in.,2
3387,"My overall experience was very good, considering the amount of travellers who going through the system.",4
3388,"Excellent service, quick and easy with no problems would highly recommend using.",5
3389,"Easy to find, closer to terminals, price is reasonable and hassle free, Very easy to get in and out, number plate recognition, no need to find ticket and pay on arrivals, very very convenient. would definitely use it again.",5
3390,Used the Multistory Car park and it was great...Terminal 2 MSCP was easy to find and easy to use.  Very convenient for the terminal building,5
3391,No signage for Premium parking then advised to park other than where you have paid for!,3
3392,"Very good airport, but this trip was rather spoiled by very slow baggage delivery. As other flights seemed to be getting their baggage quicker this is possibly a one-off issue",4
3393,"Manchester Airport has improved so much over the past few years, it is now a pleasure to depart and arrive. It is a pleasant place to spend time before departure.",5
3394,So many of the people working there seem to be under too much time pressure from their workloads to be able to have time to give you a smile or do their job without making little mistakes.,3
3395,"Ok airport with car parking problems, at the moment, due to building work. A bloody awful Border Control system upon arrival on way home. Otherwise my favourite airport.",3
3396,I used the wrong car park by mistake.  The operator politely explained the problem and waived the additional fee i should have paid.  Great service.,5
3397,Have travelled through Manchester many times. Very easy.,5
3398,Our baggage went missing for an hour on our return- after being held on the plane for 50 minutes after landing.,1
3399,Terminal 2 is really quick to pass through since Monarch ceased operations. No queues  for anything.,5
3400,"AVOID Manchester Airport Meet & Greet - Just a glorified car park. Find your own car, trek with your bags, across a car park outside in the rain. You go to them, they don't meet you. Very confused about what I paid for other than for a close car park? Oh, and they gave me the keys to someone else's car to top it off - v. unprofessional.",1
3401,Despite all the works and building still a good airport to travel to and from.,5
3402,"Ease of access when arriving at airport, but some routes from the the M&G reception to the car parks could be improved for customers on their return (it can sometimes be difficult to negotiate past the parked cars of departing customers)",4
3403,"Poor signage.Disinterested staff. Unpleasant security, awkward for people with poor mobility.",2
3404,Not the best airport in the world but not the worst either.,4
3405,Made departure and arriving back easy and not spoiling the holiday,5
3406,Rude staff at bag security check-point. Zero consideration for people that have fear from flying. At arrivals lost the bags of 50 people and no one could guess where were they.,2
3407,Apart from some low points on arrival the whole experience was good.,5
3408,Not valet parking and not meet and greet. Had to walk to a portacabin to then be sent back the way we came to find our car on the other side of a multi-storey car park. Prices hiked up the closer you get to departure date so ended up going up £15 in the matter of 2 days. Will park in normal parking in the future as it’s closer.,1
3409,Large queues at check  in and security . Too many steps when you are carrying a cabin bag and when you return again too many steps to get to passport control and a 50 minute wait for the cases is very poor. Car parking was good though,2
3410,"Very grumpy security and parking on Airparks can be stressful finding spaces,",3
3411,Very convenient and excellent experience booking online and then just turning up with the ANPR readers on the barriers.,5
3412,"Excellent service. Well run and easy to navigate both on-line and on site. Staff are courteous, helpful and efficient.",5
3413,"Wouldn’t advise getting the valet but besides that your in for a treat very well sign posted, easy in and out services and the staff we’ve very friendly I love Manchester!",5
3414,Paid for secure parking only to return on Christmas morning to find car had been broken into and items stolen. I fully appreciate these things can happen but when questioning staff was amazed to find it had been happening frequently to other customers and there was no survailance cameras. Apr cameras on entrance didn’t know my car was in car park because their was snow on my numberplateHappy  hristmas,1
3415,I have used the Meet & Greet car par a few times and it has always been a very positive experience.,5
3416,"Booked online, received no confirmation email but knew I had entered my correct email address as after making booking I started receiving promotional emails from Manchester Airport, unsure if this is normal or a system error.As a personal thing, as entry and exit is by ANPR I would like some form of notification by text or email of confirmation of entry and exit.Overall experience though was good.",4
3417,Sorry but I won't use your car park again,1
3418,Great people extremely polite happy and helpful,5
3419,Don't use jet parks. Use the on-site car parks instead.,3
3420,Everything was perfect except of the 4 miles they did with my car. I prefer to do  not use for so much miles our cars.,4
3421,"Get ready for really unhelpful staff on security. Never a smile or a ""thank you"" or a ""sorry for the delay""",2
3422,Poor space between vehiclesReally small spaces for vehicles which was ok for cars 10-20 years ago but newer vehicles are larger and therefore need larger spaces.  Lighting is outdated and makes the space feel dark and unsecure.  Did not recognise vehicle on way out so need to contact security office.,3
3423,No major issue occurred; all wonderful and great!,5
3424,airport built with no thought about passengers what so ever its all about getting people into the duty free shops,3
3425,"Drop off is very close to the terminal and very quick. no complaints, would use again.",5
3426,"Tremendous service, no complaints from me.",5
3427,Don’t use multi-storey car park  car was damaged,1
3428,"TAP is a good company but it's subjected to delays at the airports condition, the flight is in a regular time",5
3429,"flying from manchester is a safe and pleasent experience security is tough but in this day and age its to be expected,i have arrived by train and car both pleasent.",5
3430,Old and creepy in modern airport feels like ur flying from a city in the middle ages,1
3431,Overall good experience though car parking can be confusing when looking for your designated car park.,4
3432,No transfer from Terminal 2 car part to Terminal 1 departures,3
3433,"Insufficient clear signage - from approach to airport , parking and gate information -",2
3434,"We used meet & greet parking at T3. We returned to T1 and the guys delivered our car there. Very impressed with the meet & greet service, will use it again.",4
3435,The car park bus service operators are so incompetent that my family and I came within 9 minutes of missing our flight to our Xmas holiday to Lapland.  We paid £5000 for this holiday and looked forward to it for 12 months. Will NEVER EVER risk using this service again. Absolutely & completely unacceptable.,1
3436,Easy to park and arrive at departures. Worth the extra expense over other outside of airport car parks.,4
3437,smooth and easy service,5
3438,"Def recommend, on site no messing. So fast",5
3439,"Apart from road construction and google maps not being up to date with the info, it was a very simple and easy to use experience. Especially the vehicle recognition on entry and exit.",4
3440,Very convenient. Fast drop off on this occasion but slow pick-up as queues can be long to drop off / pick up keys.,4
3441,good service but car park expensive no discounts for long stay,3
3442,Car park entry was straightforward & location was within a couple of minutes of terminal.,4
3443,Road works made finding the car park difficult,4
3444,The longstay airport car park is convenient to use.,4
3445,Our favourite airport and getting better all the time,4
3446,"Not really a meet and greet service, more like park and walk.",3
3447,"Overall a very good experience. The security was very thorough and took some time, but I am all for it being that way - it made you feel as safe as you can be these days.",5
3448,Very good service. No issues at all,5
3449,Poor signage on the car park itself. Difficult to follow traffic flow. Also took a while to exit the barriers-camera didn't recognise number plate- bit frustrating,4
3450,Baggage delivery was pathetically slow. Waited over an hour.,4
3451,Airport was excellent but the Jetparks car park ateas are in need of a bit if TLC especially now the rain is here.,5
3452,"Not cheap, but website easy to use for booking. Easy entry to and exit from car park.",4
3453,"car park is good, border staff turned misery & rudeness into an art form",4
3454,"Nightmare checking in bags due to some fault or other at the Thomas Cook check ins,some explanation would have been good.On return landing 40 mins delay in getting hold of a 'telehandler'  before we could exit the plane,and of course the usual cue at passport control,but at least the automated system was working for a change! And give yourself extra time to find Car Parks due to the work being carried our at the Airport temporary signage is poor if nonexistent.",3
3455,Overall a satisfactory experience on a very busy day,4
3456,Efficient service and I would recommend the extra expense for a fast track through security.,4
3457,good overall experience,4
3458,Arrivals disappointing compared to other countries an embarrassment at times..departure from car Park delayed due to not acknowledging my booking.Airport check in very slow not enough staff on duty all in all not a good experience....😡,2
3459,Should be a much better place once expansion works are completed. Presently there is congestion on roads around the terminals and for passengers within the terminals. Congestion at baggage checking can be severe! Chris Fox,3
3460,Easy to find.Clean areasEase of exitHelpful staff,5
3461,"My experience recently has not really been any better or worse than previously. I had no problem entering the car park, but on leaving after our holiday we could NOT exit the car park because apparently I used an orange coloured token when I shouldn't have used anything and to cap it all despite paying for the car parking via the internet your machine requested that I pay £480.00 to exit the carpark. Needless to say this didn't happen but it demonstrates shoddiness and unprofessionalism. You need to up your game.",3
3462,Poor signage for parking and number plate recognition didn’t work in car park. Longs delays at security and unfriendly staff.,2
3463,"Security staff are arrogant, rude and unhelpful.",3
3464,Easy and quick we use every time.,5
3465,"Overall airport experience is not necessarily bad at all. But the building it's self is old and tired. The odd repair jobs are of poor standard. The toilets are pretty filthy and smell of urine. Security and bag check area is also a bit disappointing.One major complaint is as follows. On a big sign in the security area it reads ""liquids and gels must be stored in a clear sealable plastic bag"". So I decided to use my own (virtually identical bag) to speed things up. When I arrived at security I was angrily told that they must be ""our"" plastic bags and the staff tipped all my toiletries out and re packed them in an almost identical bag. Very petty and stupid I thought.",3
3466,Car park was fine however if you can afford the extra I would in future book the more expensive one where your car is collected from the airport itself and returned to the airport upon arrival.Worth every penny.,4
3467,Awful jet parks 45minuite waiting times drivers stopping for a cigarette. Also worst baggage system and immigration in the world so slow in unbelievable!!,1
3468,I found the security line in Terminal 1  far too long and the bag screening chaotic.,3
3469,"Car returned to meet and greet in disgusting, muddy condition.   Horrendous to see my pride and joy, less than 2000 miles on the clock looking like it did",3
3470,Good. Great staff assistance.,5
3471,"Jet park 3 is usually quite good, but not on this occasion. we arrived on 10th December 2017 around 5.15 am, service was quick and efficient,Quickly through check in and security and passport control, had breakfast at the Spinning Jenny, service was very poor, food was rubbish, staff aggressive and intimidating, tables dirty, staff were eastern European, so ignorant, we will not be eating there again! On return to uk, again straight through security and passport control. a shame about the jet park 3 bus return journey, he didn't really know the route around the jet park, told us to get off at the exit and wait for next bus! He also stopped for a 5 minute cig break! The next bus arrived about 10 minutes later, the driver got us to our car at Y5, a pleasure not!",3
3472,I suggest u dunt book through jet parks as they let my car get stolen while we are away in Mexico we land on 27th off December and I’ve 3 kids to get home and all they av said is ring police a shunt have to ring the police u shpudnt have let anyone in to tow my car away they haven’t even apologised or nothing,1
3473,"Car park is easy to find, had no trouble entering or exiting",5
3474,airport and service good. Airline used not so good.,4
3475,Do not book Jet Parks they are a terrible company and they lie... The Airport however is excellent,5
3476,This place is a sh!t hole. Meet and Greet had a great time beating up my Porsche. Check in is disorganized and there are not enough people to deal with the customers. The airport is dirty generally and it’s a bit annoying how they force you to walk through duty and crazy people asking you if you want to try on perfume. Duty free is fine; don’t force me to walk through it. Take some notes from the rest of the world.,1
3477,Easy to book car park with no printing etc,5
3478,"Quick and easy booking on the day of use. Has to be at least one hour prior to entering the car park. Found a space on the top floor. Took about 15 mins to locate a space once in the car park. Excellent service, car unmarked on return, no concerns. Would book again, for sure! Price is ok, paid the same for a 3 week holiday as we did for 4 day weekend break. When it comes to car parking at the airports, it’s more cost effective to go away for longer!!",5
3479,Very easy to use and great customer service.,5
3480,Fantastic service Ptoffesional staff Would use every time now Thank you for making it a great experience,5
3481,Used  meet & greet service and it worked very well . The additional cost compared to their long stay was worth it.,5
3482,"Car park easy to find , just confusing to which bay to park in .",4
3483,normal cattle market experiance,3
3484,"Terminal 3 at Manchester airport is awful. It's far too small for the number of passengers, there aren't enough seats or facilities. The toilets are filthy. And finally the security staff are horrible. I understand they have a serious job but there is absolutely no need to be so brusque and rude to passengers! Flying from terminal 3 really does get your holiday off to a bad start!",3
3485,We park here all the time and it always goes smoothly.Great service.,5
3486,"excellent airport but very poor car parking. no mention of roadworks or additional traffic lights in online directions which caused some problems.if number plate recognition fails to work, then help virtually unavailable.  help buttons unanswered so you end up having to pay twice for parking and then the  refund &  complaints procedure very poor to inaccessible.",3
3487,Car park was excellent as I had prebooked my stay. Quick to use and very close to the airport. I would recommend this service to anyone,5
3488,"Parking easy to book but expensive,however very easy to use bus drivers very helpful. Check in easy security staff not consistent at all  and caused loss of a hat and gloves by swapping items from one bin to another. They were trying to do their best but I went through with belt on and my wife asked to take hers off, I kept my shoes on whist she had to remove hers. I had a minor problem and they were really helpful so just a little bit inconsistent and somewhat overworked. We flew to Frankfurt where we had a long taxi to the gate but sailed through customs and immigration as we did on return but far more relaxed than Manchester a real long walk up and down steps and then a long queue at immigration. Still more staff selling perfume than in immigration albeit we may not have seen thenm all but it does give the impression that the operators are more concerned with profit than travellers experience.",4
3489,Very convenient for terminal and easy to locate,5
3490,"I use airports in major cities all over the world and Manchester rates well down the list. Staff are probably the most unhelpful that I experience in my business travels. Baggage takes far longer to arrive than most other airports and the baggage halls are always crowded, resulting in a scrum for luggage which doesn't happen anywhere else. Overall, a poor experience.",2
3491,T3 security experience is without doubt the worst I have ever encountered - chaotic is an understatement. T3 in general is overcrowded and unpleasant and should be avoided wherever possible.,2
3492,"Always use Manchester, only downside is the queuing and waiting, overall good experience",5
3493,Never had any problems and will use again.,5
3494,Car parking was very bad as there were several T3 car parks and it was not clear which one i was meant to be in. And a fee of £370 was demanded at the exit even though i had payed in advance. £24.99i have been to other airports and this was the worst experience of my life.,1
3495,"The roadworks are a pain if you miss your turning or dont know the roads at all, sinage needs to be improved",3
3496,I never park anywhere else when I fly from Manchester and never had a problem.,5
3497,"Having pre booked months before I assumed that there would be a parking spot for me when I arrived......no, I was driving around the carpark basically waiting for an available space because they were full! Bare this in mind when booking, if your delayed and need to catch a flight with minimal delays DO NOT use this car park to pre book. They wont reserve an already paid for space. Oh and dont ask for help getting out.....the staff are not a fan of helping.",1
3498,"If purchasing Fast Track security and  travelling with Jet2 then be aware that Fast Track security is on an entirely different level to where the Jet2 check in area and security entrance are so only worth it if travelling during busier periods and you can navigate your way to the alternate entrance.The Meet and Greet car park can be convenient,however, if using during peak seasons be prepared to queue outside when waiting to drop off your key.",3
3499,Terrible experience from car parking to check in and arrivals. staff very rude. emirates check in staff talking across to colleague on next desk rather than giving full attention to customer. no good morning have a nice flight or kiss my butt. car park like ice skating ring not good considering we parked in disabled area. to finalise after waiting at collection belt on return for nearly an hr (A380) we were informed our luggage was all in Dubai and would be couriered by lunch next day. no explanation or apology. finally arrive at 22.00 following day. very bad experience. the airport is old and dated and staff constantly seen on mobile phones,1
3500,"A thoroughly trouble free and simple experience, well worth the money and definitely my first choice for my next trip.",5
3501,"Very poor car parking experience with Jet Parks, watch out for roadworks near terminal one, 2 hour wait in security in terminal one. Not a great start to an holiday!",1
3502,"Getting better. Small queue on way out, much faster immigration on return. Car park ANPR system is an excellent improvement.",4
3503,Car parking is an excellent experience. Would never use any other,5
3504,"Use meet and greet every time, great service!",5
3505,Parking arrangement - could be improved - directions on entry not great. Signage poor and lightning. Cars crammed in a bit. Exit route not signposted that well to get out of car park. Airport in general - bit tired and dated and finding Departures was not straightforward until a helpful chap pointed out the hidden door and stairs.,3
3506,Don`t use JET2 Car Parks - it was a horrid experience!,2
3507,Desperately in need of major investment to reach the level of other European airport serving similar sized cities,2
3508,Easy booking process/ good value and would use again.,4
3509,I had a good trip and am happy with the experience although the food isn't very nice,4
3510,Airport good but handling/service companies very poor.Standing the cold awaiting permission to board - long wait for luggage on return,4
3511,Easy to follow directions and only a 5 minute walk from the terminal.,5
3512,Manchester Airport is great. Would definitely use Meet & Greet parking again!,5
3513,"We arrived on time to the booking office and the lady that served us read our details to us .This is when we found we had made a error by one day.I explained we needed to pay for one extra day and was told it would be £25 extra. Considering the total payment equated to around £5 a day this came as a shock. I said I didn't have an option but to pay as when you have a flight to catch  you are in a corner but I said I would be complaining once back home.At that point one of the male staff leaned over and said ""you can try over the road at £93 per day or the other one at £35 per day if you wish"". I found this to be rude and arrogant .My problem was with Manchester Airport meet and greet not anyone else and this didn't make me feel any better. Being the calm person I am I didn't react to this ignorant outburst and paid and left for my flight.I found the experience a terrible start to what was going to be a trip of a lifetime to see my mum for her 90th birthday in Australia. I expect to pay more for under booking but what equates to around five extra days penalty and then be subjected to a ""telling off"" as I saw it was rude and unprofessional.£15 would have been more than fair and it took less than 2 mins to fleece me of another £25 so I don't know where the charges appear from. I complained to customer services and it has been 3 weeks without a reply so it doesn't look like im getting one .Good job I don't charge them for the time it takes to reply.",1
3514,Very easy and clear to use. Meet and Greet every trip.,5
3515,"Why must ""security"" be such a hassle--staff ""shouting"" instructions--poorly organised ""system"".?Why are the GATE ""announcements"" left to the last minute?Why is the CAR PARK such a RIP OFF--leave the car at 7am and pick it up at 4.30 pm same day £40......Why do I have to walk though avenues of shops?Really annoying- all Iw ant to do is fly but you make it so hard  because you are trying to ""monetise"" everything. STOP IT- treat me like a travelling customer not someone who must be made to walk past every shop in the building--made to walk along rope controlled zig zag mazes like a herd of brain dead sheep.We are human beings --please treat us as suchReally",2
3516,"Staff at meet and greet are really helpful, polite and cheery no matter what time of the day or night, good value parking onsite and close to the terminal.",5
3517,Would highly recommend. Car park was easy to get to & when we parked up it was just seconds of a walk to the departures. Will be using again.,5
3518,Very happy with meet and greet car park service.,5
3519,Very impressed!.  I had made a mistake with my vehicle registration number on the booking website but staff were on hand (through the intercom) on entry and exit to get me on my way with little fuss.  Excellent.,5
3520,poor. rickety arrival sheds with rain leaking in. so many stairs and no lifts for famiiles with small kids.,2
3521,Not a good experience on this occasion due to the major road works around the airport - we couldn't actually find the carp pakr we were booked into!  Thankfully with time to check-in running out we were very grateful to the car park operator we chanced upon who said we could park there.  I'm sure all will be well once everything complete and it'll be back to a 5* rating as in the past.,3
3522,"Terminal 3 at Manchester airport is very slow through baggage check and passport control on the way back into the UK. There is a lack of capacity to cope with demand seemingly. Additionally the airport itself is dirty and unkempt, as well as often being over crowded.I travel regularly by air globally and this is the worst airport I travel through.",1
3523,"Good airport let down by slow security. Not as bad as some but not enough staff managing the ""manual check"" baggage.",3
3524,Fast and efficient check in and check out. Very pleased with service and provision of fast track passes. Will definitely use again for day trips.,5
3525,Security always a complete nightmare purely due to under-staffing; excuses that travelers unprepared for procedure not acceptable when numerous xray positions unmanned.,3
3526,Shocking security experience and poor car park signage.,1
3527,The ANPR didn't work for our pre-booking in the T1 multi storey and the spaces were a bit too small. However the easy access to the airport was a plus. The airport was clean and tidy and we had no delays. Food and drink services were a bit slow. Security was also a bit weird about allowing the rest of the family to stay with my sister and her baby.,3
3528,T3 experience is poor - vastly outdated and overdeveloped site with no real prospect of improvement without demolishing and starting again,3
3529,Great locations easy access and exit A must when the need flexibility during traveling Globally,4
3530,Very efficient service.,5
3531,Terminal 3 Meet & Greet signs should be clearer upon arrival and departure. More seating facilities need to be made available. Coffee vending machines should be installed especially at night when shops are closed. Parking charges are expensive compared to Stansted Airport.,3
3532,"very easy to use, easy to find and very easy to walk to the terminal",5
3533,Brilliant. So easy to book online and then park. Less than 5 mins walk to check in and from departures. Will definitely use again,5
3534,Luggage handling on return very very poor,2
3535,"Good  service, but a bit pricey",4
3536,Good  location near to the terminal. Efficient booking in process  and quick  key collection on return,4
3537,Easy  service to use. Had to change plans and this was also a simple process.,4
3538,"Manchester airport is good in that ist offers a lot of flights, but the terminals are too small for the number of passengers they squeeze through.  This means the terminals are crowded, uncomfortable and often not clean.  The security lines can be very long at times. So, if I have a choice, I use other airports.",2
3539,"it works, I use the airport regularly and generally don't have issues",4
3540,"Mixed. Out bound is not nice. Navigating to the gate through Duty Free is  a nightmare. Rip off prices on everything in all shops and restaurants  Long queues upon arrival. Security staff don't seem to care. Many 3rd world airports are more modern, cleaner and friendlier. Baggage delivery is very slow. Baggage hall is small and has oppressive low ceilings. No apparent customs personnel present. Toilet facilities in baggage claim are an absolute joke, small for the number of people and difficult to negotiate with luggage.",2
3541,NO visible signs to the Premium parking area. NO visible signs to the lifts - internally or externally.,3
3542,"Really good service, just make sure your number plate is clean",5
3543,"Good service, and you know your car is where you left it!!",5
3544,"We enjoyed using Manchester Airport. The extra cost of T1 Meet & Greet car parking was money well spent! The convenience and peace of mind added to our holiday experience. To arrive back to snow and ice (-5C) to have the car close by and cleared of snow and ice was very welcome! Thank you, we will recommend others to use this service too!",5
3545,Generally very good experience but security is a pain and more seating is needed at departures which I see is being addressed.,4
3546,"They have a lot of roadworks at the moment and the normal approach from Style to Terminal 2 is closed. There are no diversion signs and as a result I found myself turned back onto the motorway and had to go to the next junction and back which was very stressful. I did eventually find my way back to T2 from the motorway. There was also an issue on arriving back. We were stuck on the plane after landing for over 30 minutes. Instead of being docked at the terminal, the plane was parked out on a corner of the airport. The first set if steps failed, as did the second. They had to bring in a third set from across the airport which finally worked. By the time we had got on buses and through immigration I thought that at least our bags would be there but no! The caurosel said all bags would be delivered by 9.28. By about 9.40 it said all bags had been delivered which was clearly not the case as half the plane were still waiting. Eventually our bags arrived at 9.50, about and hour and a half after the plane landed. Information provided should be accurate or there is no point providing it.",2
3547,"Security clearance is a disgrace. Rude, unfriendly and threatening behavior by staff. Long ques and only half lanes open.Why put a department store in your path to the gates. If I want to shop I will visit the shops. I visit an airport to catch a plane!",2
3548,"Excellent airport experience, stress free, enjoyable and value for money.",5
3549,Easy convenient no waiting for taxis roughly same price as a taxi return made a nice change,5
3550,Only complaint - surface between bus stop and parking bays could be improved.Otherwise - I would not hesitate to use JETPARKS (2) car parking again,4
3551,Never go anywhere else! The cheaper options mean poor service. Very efficient and friendly and easy to use. Will use the meet and greet on every trip.,5
3552,We always use meet and greet at Manchester Terminals due to close proximity to departures/arrivals at all Terminals. Always had good service and assistance and good value for money.l and our vehicles have always been l9oked after unl8ke offsite parking where we have returned to find damage to our vehicles.,5
3553,Parking at terminal 2 and arrivals no problems fast thank you,5
3554,No problems other than muddy puddles - wear decent shoes.,4
3555,"does what it should do, park your car",4
3556,Security was a nightmare. Queues merging and too few gates open.On returning long queues again merging for immigration. Only half the automatic gates open.We had to guess which carousel our luggage was arriving on. Didn't appear on screen.Apart from that parking and transportation easy and a lovely airport.,3
3557,Appalling experience finding Ringway car park as a result of woefully inadequate signposting through the airport roadworks. Took almost an hour after leaving the M56 to find the car park entrance.,1
3558,Always book meet & greet as the staff are just brilliant,5
3559,"We parked on the Jetparks Ringway , the price is right and the service is right , will be using it again no question .",5
3560,Excellent website for booking the car in & if you need to edit also very simple! Car parking excellent & staff really helpful & friendly highly recommend Meet & Greet!,5
3561,Lots of road works at the airport and poor diversion signs for the jetpark car parks .,3
3562,Security is a joke... I don't know any other airport where it can take so long time again and again. Even when i buy fast track it can take 15-25 minutes to get through.,2
3563,"Meet and greet at T1 was flawless. The baggage handling on our return was as poor as expected. After a 2 hour flight, 1hr 20min wait for baggage! Unacceptable.",2
3564,"Meet and greet, excellent serviceSecurity checks inconsistent and lackof staff at meal times",3
3565,A good way to park but always have difficulty in finding correct entrance and finding way to departure area after parking. Number pate recognition system ALWAYS fails to read number plate and have to ring control but staff are always obliging and problem solved quickly,4
3566,"Nice & Easy, Very helpful with the weather & late flights",5
3567,"Great overall airport - fast, no stress and generally positive experience. Parked car in T1/T3 Long Stay, got through security fast and had no issues.",5
3568,Great parking facility very quick and easy access to airport. Well priced and good sized spaces,5
3569,Be careful when parking there was a small accident on entering the airport near the long stay parking for terminal 3 so i rang the buzzer and had to park in the short term park i was then told to contest it when i was coming home by hitting the buzzer i was then told to pay £120 and i had to apeal against it you cant actually speak to these people they hide behind emails  they are not customer facing i even rang from my 2 day holiday i would rather give the money to charity than be lied to they even managed to lose my 1st email the worst ever car parking experience and they  cover up by lying badically it seems that possesion is the law .,1
3570,Security process was a bit daunting for a first time experience.,3
3571,Better than the smaller airports I can use.,4
3572,"Plan in quite a time on both ends, everything takes a long time.",3
3573,No problems at all and my husband and I always use this airport when we fly abroad,5
3574,"Excellent location long stay terminal 1& 3 ,however the signage is  not very clear the lines need repainting. There is a lot of works going on in the car park.",4
3575,"Convenient, hassle-free parking at reasonable cost.",5
3576,Departure gate  called through then left to freeze in stair way prior to boarding the plane,4
3577,Good Facilities and Efficient Security Control,4
3578,Very convenient for a four day holiday break just before Christmas,5
3579,"Easy to park, clean,great security.",5
3580,Everything went well until we could not exit the car park due to a malfunction of the number plate recognition system causing delays and frustration due to the lack of human assistance,3
3581,I thought I payed a lot for parking there.,4
3582,"I found the experience of checking in alright but having a soft bag, I was told it needed to be taken elsewhere and as the directions were so vague I never found it and had to carry my bag to the boarding gate.  The pre boarding areas were very overcrowded leaving me feeling that I was herded to the gate. Food areas very cramped food usual quick service o.k. but much better quality of food at similar outlets away from the airport.",3
3583,"Great airport, we can always find a good flight from Manchester and its really easy and convenient.",5
3584,"Great service. Roadworks made finding the car park a bit confusing, but got there.",4
3585,A bit chaotic trying to find way around both departing and arriving,3
3586,"Great airport, friendly courteous staff with a few exceptions ( mainly in the security area ) Easy to navigate despite ongoing works. Three great terminals with a raft of shops and bars etc.",5
3587,"Can there be a poorer terminal in the UK than T1 at MAN? The whole experience - from the general condition of the terminal to the unique upstairs/downstairs/upstairs/downstairs route to passport control - is incomparable to any other airport I have used in Europe. Additionally, how can it take 20 minutes at 11.30 p.m. - when there are a very limited if any other arrivals - to get a set of steps to the plane on arrival at the terminal?",2
3588,great airport - don't use the Gents toilets on arrival (next to baggage claim)... nasty.,4
3589,"Baggage check took too long, appeared not to be enough staff or checking facilities available.",4
3590,The airport is incredibly convenient for travel but is currently a building site.,3
3591,We've used the meet and greet service recently which makes it easy to access the terminals quickly (and is not much more expensive).  Always found it straightforward to get through security etc. and there are good facilities on the air-side of the airport,4
3592,Very poor road signs to jet park 1 due to road works,4
3593,"We had booked flights with Thomas Cook and our reserved seats were not available.  By the time we were on the plane we had been given three alternative boarding passes.  My wife is fitted with a DBS and we had a very unpleasant experience with security personnel.  I appreciate that security is important, but we are also the airports customer's, courtesy and respect costs nothing, threats to terminate your flight smacks of overzealous Big Brother.",2
3594,Pre booked car parking.. followed directions with email.. initially wondered if we would find a space but after moving further into the car park there were spaces available. The bus for transfer to airport came within approximately 5 mins. Very easy to use its a anpr system so no codes or paperwork required. Overall good experience and I would be happy to use again.,4
3595,"Great price and good, regular shuttle service to each terminal. Pricing can vary meaning some external sites are more competitive at times. The location is a real plus although when it rains it can be a nightmare in the parking spots - better drainage needed.",4
3596,"does its job. no delays with transfers.no waiting in all weathers for transfers. no scratches to car on return(meet &greet) take note. drive in, park up, and fly. no problem",5
3597,Poorly surfaced car park not compatible with wheeled luggage. Route to gates made deliberately longer with obligatory route through the shop.Basically a business designed to lock you down for hours until boredom forces you to shop.The true purpose of an airport being to get planes and passengers closer together is lost to the designers and management of Manchester Airport.,2
3598,It is always an excellent experience apart from the price I pay . At times it is really expensive but due to profuse convenience I end up here every time.,5
3599,"Great airport, used for many years",5
3600,Made my flight experience a good one!,4
3601,Improving all the time. Minor disruption due to ongoing works but how else could it be done?We have a closer alternative but prefer the facilities at Manchester and ease of getting there.,4
3602,Baggage is always an issue at Manchester airport. They have introduced a fast track through immigration but the baggage takes that long that it’s a waste of money as everyone off your flight will get through before any bags come out ! The rest of what they supply is very good .,4
3603,"Very easy to use , The on line booking and payment made the process very easy.Drove straight in and straight out after.",5
3604,Overall a good place to park your car. Very easy and friendly staff.,4
3605,Quick easy no hasstle a please to use,5
3606,"Would always use in future, so easy for the Terminal",4
3607,Airport needs updating and staff require training - security is the worst I've seen (take at least 60 flights a year) in Europe. The queuing system in security is a joke and the staff are ill mannered.,1
3608,Everything worked fine.,4
3609,"General experience good, but my wife uses a wheelchair and finds the security process very hard going with little or no help in regards to the refitting of shoes and re-dressing after passing through security. Everyone working there was most welcoming and polite and given that their work is essential and can be a little invasive they do it well.Just to put a little icing on the cake, please show a little more care for wheelchair bound travellers.",4
3610,If the registration recognition software is not working look for the very small button with a telephone symbol on it for help!,3
3611,Excellent parking facility at the T1/T3 long term car park. Use of the ANPR system makes the experience very smooth.,5
3612,"It’s a pity the baggage handlers at Frankfurt airport weren’t as efficient, then they wouldn’t have lost our baggage",4
3613,Always find Manchester Airport easy to get around and find where you need to be except for the stupid lifts where they are somewhat confusing for getting out for the right terminal. Having to walk through the smelly cosmetics to get to the waiting area is also not very good but otherwise a good airport,5
3614,"I used the short stay car park facility, very easy to find and use.",4
3615,Expensive parking with poor layout and signage,2
3616,Good parking facilities and good pick up buses both to and from the airport with friendly staff,5
3617,"Fast efficient and no stress. Read the emails they send you, directions etc. Show up check in, enjoy!",5
3618,No easy way of reaching the departure gates without having to waste time going through the shops!!,3
3619,"Very convenient airport for me. I look at prices for Manchester, Leeds Bradford and Liverpool to get the best deal. Going through security is often hectic, but there is constant information about what you have to take out of your bags and what cannot be put in the placcy bag. So great relief she i get to the other side.It's always a bind to have to go through the concessions and a ramp by the steps from the at a by Boots to the gates to the left would be good.",5
3620,Good experience. Good price. Easy to find. Felt car park was a safe place to leave vehicle. Very regular transfers to all terminals. Shop around for best price. Definitely will use this service again.,5
3621,Very good experiance overall,5
3622,Great service and value for money. I would recommend the meet and greet service to anyone.,5
3623,Easy to book online and no issues with arrival and departure from car park. Close enough to walk to terminal. Will use again.,5
3624,Everything is a bit of a nightmare now due to the construction around T2.  Very difficult at 3am to find T3 multy story car park.  Didn't feel safe in the car park either as the lighting was very dim and there are no staff around at all.,4
3625,Always a pleasure...takes the hassle out of everything..No more cold walks trying to find your car...worth every penny,5
3626,Great parking,5
3627,EVERYTHING IS FINE,5
3628,Not a great transfer experience.  I've used many times and it's erratic at best,3
3629,"There are no signs to direct pedestrians! So one may presume the exit is close to the entrance, so we follow the directions to the exit, and walk back the way we drove. Then there's a sign 'no pedestrians'! So we have to go around not knowing where to exit from, with luggage and in the rain. Time is ticking, the check-in time limit approaching, and all making the whole experience miserable.",1
3630,"First time used, easy, great value for money",5
3631,Plastic bag for liquids  - even a solid liquid! 1 bag? the size of a sandwich bag and must be sealed - my only 'bug bear'!,4
3632,Makes the airport experience relatively painless and returning quick and easy,4
3633,"Remember to take the little card with you to collect your keys, not just the piece of paper! Otherwise all went really smoothly, conveniently situated for departures and arrivals, would use again",3
3634,"great parking, smooth process from check in, security, beers to boarding.",4
3635,"Watch out for hotel parking charges on land owned by the airport, at the instigation of the airport not the hotels",5
3636,"5 stars: Excellent – no reservations, I would recommend this company to anyone.",5
3637,Better signposting on the approach to Terminal 2 and this on site parking will be perfect. Plenty of spaces undercover & easy walking distance to the terminal building.,4
3638,Very good facilities and staff all very helpful,5
3639,Simple online booking.  Even altering the booking was simple with no penalties.Overall good experience,5
3640,"Meet and Greet service, great value for money. Gives me piece of mind, no parking hassle no security worries",5
3641,If possible park at T3 multi storey rather than T1,4
3642,Would highly recommend 5*,5
3643,"We pre-paid for a 10 day stay. The multi-storey car park didn't recognise our number plate so this caused  problems. The car park was very congested ie at a solid stand still, and access to the upper floors is so poorly signed we doubted they existed. The lifts cause a bottle neck of travellers when returning to the car. This is not nice on a cold night at 11pm. Finally, the car, after 10 days away was covered in builders' dust from a neighbouring building site. I will not be using this car park again.",2
3644,Very efficient staff and the whole experience was stress free...very clean Airport and ran smoothly 👍,5
3645,Good all round service,4
3646,good value car parking,5
3647,use of airport was ok-main problem was tring to access carparking with all the road diversions,4
3648,Very stressful experience.specially for older person.,3
3649,Terminal 3 needs a refurb. Security staff are rude and unhelpful. They could learn a lot from LHR T5 Security staff. I only choose Manchester as I'm much closer to there than Heathrow,3
3650,Expensive car park with a captive audience. Run down dreary terminal. Insufficient security guards so long delays at baggage search.,3
3651,Finding an available space in the Multi-storey in Terminal 1 was not stress free. Driving around for 10 minutes to find a space is not acceptable.,3
3652,"I would have no reservation in recommending this parking facility.  The booking process was smooth and simple. The confirmation email contained all the details to find the car park and arrival instructions.  The transfer bus, both on arrival and departure, arrived swiftly and literally takes minutes.  All in all an excellent service, at a very reasonable price.",5
3653,"Like many modern airports, they have become cattle markets through security control and at border control on return.  Pity, as Manchester used to be a beacon of how to do it well; now we just have to put up with it.  We are seriously looking at departing from smaller airports for that more personal touch.",3
3654,"Good accessible parking but the security lanes at terminal 3 are often overcrowded and slow.  The staff try hard but are stressed and whilst most are good humoured some can be very rude and dismissive.  Terminal 3 itself is like a bus station - upgrading and expansion are needed to provide a better experience.  Having said that it’s all pretty ok, but no better than that.",4
3655,"Easy to book, easy to find the car park, transfer bus arrived promptly. Good value for money and you park your own car in a secure car park so no worries of it being abused by car parking staff.",5
3656,"Meet and greet car parking a great option, security searches a nightmare -long winded and slow - you could easily miss your flight. Small plastic bag option a nightmare for women with cosmetics etc",4
3657,The delays in passengers passing through the terminal require attention. It is the single thing that would cause us to look at another airport.,2
3658,A lot of work going on at the moment so had a long walk to the plane.,4
3659,Too big. Too many roadworks. Uncomfortable departure accommodation,3
3660,Used the Meet & Greet recently and wondered what they term Meet & Greet........... for me its Meet ME not Me come to you and Greet is 'be there to Greet me..........NOT me come to you to collect my car key then go into the multi-story car park to find it.................,3
3661,"Stress free, clean, helpful freindly staff makes travelling a pleasure",5
3662,security is terrible. Over a 35 minute wait. I will bear this in mind when selecting where to fly from in the future.,3
3663,"Really easy to book, confirmation and directions clear to understand. Would recommend",5
3664,Terminal 2 is chaotic due to upgrading . Very little seating in departure area while waiting for gates to open and extremely busy and difficult to move around,3
3665,Needs a bit updating but good selection of shops,4
3666,"Very expensive, and at the end of a long, tiring  weekend I was denied exit from the car park on inserting the token even though I had pre-paid by credit card.",2
3667,"Have used car park many times, no problems, car gets a bit grimey but only to be expected. Beware!!!!  this trip came back to our car damaged by some idiot not paying due attention when reversing out of adjacent space and scraped a lot of paint off down to the bumper. Not a pleasant thing to find after a long flight and what was up to then a great holiday,",3
3668,The multi storey carpark is very convenient. However it is often very full and you need to leave plenty of time to find a space. Spaces are tight especially if you are next to a 4WD.,4
3669,"Excellent experience from arrival to departure, both on outward and inward journy.",5
3670,easy to find and use,4
3671,Good car park just done pay for the car valet as do a very poor job,3
3672,Hassle free service from start to finish. Easy to book easy to find. Excellent service.,5
3673,"My passport never works in the automated booths, otherwise as good as any other airports",4
3674,Great parking in a good location close to the terminal. Easy to use,4
3675,Overall good experience at Airport.,4
3676,Car park easy to find. Automatic barriers worked perfectly. Easily found a space (terminal 1/3 long stay). We were lucky the transfer bus arrived instantly both departing and arriving. Cheaper than taxi (long weekend).,5
3677,Too many carry on luggage passengers making security and access to seats far too long.,3
3678,"Meet and Greet T3 is an excellent service and much appreciated by this lady who travels on her own and often returns late at night.  Finding a car in a remote car park, in the dark (and usually wet) is not very pleasant.  The M&G team have been faultless in my experience and I would not hesitate to recommend their service which is right on the doorstep of T3",5
3679,"Make it cheaper, it worked out nearly £20 per day to park",4
3680,excellent service generally but had a couple of problems entering the meet/greet.Terminal 1 meet greet. I changed my car between booking and travel date. I changed it on their online system and printed off the updated information. On arrival they had my old car details and it had not been updated wityh my change. Caused a 10 minute delay while they sorted it out. Had to wait at gate for theis to be done before entering. Terminal 2 Meet/Greet. Got to gate and No-one was monitoring it so nothing happened. Pressed button for assistance again no-one answered - 5 minutes sitting their wondering what was going on. Seems they only had one person in the office.Otherwise the experience was good. Even better if they sort out their software and have an extra member of staff monitoring the gate.,4
3681,Pay a bit more but beats waiting in a dark car park for a bus which is supposed to run every 10 mins or so but rarely does. Also saves at least half an hour on each end of the journey. Staff were friendly and helpful.,5
3682,Over one and a half hours from landing before we got to the car park. Had to wait 20 minutes on the aircraft before a ground crew member turned up before we were allowed off. Ridiculous for a major international airport. Another 25 minute late at immigration and then 20 minutes wait for bus back to jetpacks Ringway. Very poorly staffed and will use other airports whenever there is a choice.,2
3683,"Never use meet and greet waste of time, as it’s not meet and greet",1
3684,"Brilliant Service, with no issues at all, thank you to all the staff on the phone",5
3685,"This airport is a bad as Paris Charles De Gaulle now, there is always something broken like a lift or escalator. The immigration experience is a nightmare there is no excuse for such long queues. If your plane arrives early it is not a bonus because there is never anyone to drive the air bridge if you are early! They should put a restaurant in the arrivals hall because you have time for a 5 course meal waiting for your luggage.",1
3686,"Baggage handlers take no notice of ""prority"" business class labels on passenger luggage. My baggage was one of the last onto the carousel and necessitated a very long wait. Disappointing.",4
3687,The location is perfect for getting into and out of the terminal.  My biggest issue is that the drivers mess with car settings they don't need to when moving my vehicle!,3
3688,Good convenient location next to the terminal entrance.,5
3689,Using the Meet and Greet at T3 at Manchester airport as it’s quick and hassle free! Friendly staff and my car is always looked after.,5
3690,"As always, Manchester Airport doesn’t disappoint. Cleanliness, helpful friendly staff, good facilities",5
3691,Manchester Airport does not make for a pleasant travel experience for business travellers nor holiday makers.,2
3692,"Very helpful, looked after me when my parking went wrong, and the overall experience went from almost disaster to chilled out holiday and nice welcome home.  Just allow a bit more time than you definitely need as the area near the airport is prone to roadworks and traffic hold ups.",5
3693,Never had a bad experience with meet and greet and have used this service for years now.  I can thoroughly recommend it.,5
3694,Never had much problem at manchester was delayed for 2 hours but was fault of airline not airport everything else not had a problem with,4
3695,numberplate recognition in and out makes life very easy ...,5
3696,"Convenient car park, but don't rely on signposting on approach!",4
3697,Simple to book.. Good price and easy to find 5star,5
3698,Usually good but the restaurant (Grain Store) does terrible food that is overpriced at tables that are never cleared.  Take sandwiches.,2
3699,Very convenient airport with real global reach. Please upgrade T3!,4
3700,ok but no food or drink shops open till 5.00 not much time if on early flight,4
3701,Everything easy. Only negative is the cost of booking quite late!!,4
3702,Meet and greet car parking brilliant.  Passport control is a nightmare.,3
3703,Airport parking so much more convenient than taxi,5
3704,Straight forward and easy to use. Helpful staff.,4
3705,Great airport & parking,4
3706,"Convenient,secure and efficient",4
3707,"Using Manchester Jetparks3 was so easy. Everything went like clockwork, entry was automatic, you chose your own space and take your vehicle key with you on your trip, so no one can drive it while you are away.  The transfer buses are frequent and the driver helped people park their cases correctly.  The return journey was also similar and exit from the site was automatic due to the time being close to that initially specified.  First class and value for money.",5
3708,"Poor service throughout and feels like it's deliberately like this so you pay for the extras they sell like fast track security. To me they should just sort out the service so we don't have to pay to bypass it. Ripped of with anything you buy, seats are filthy as are the toilet area. As someone who has flow. Around the world for the last 10 years with work it has to be said this is certainly in the top 2 for worst experience. Got to the point now where I pay more to fly from or travel to another airport so I can dodge this place. Sort it out and stop trying to charge to dodge your poor service.",2
3709,Very nice airport to travel from In every way,5
3710,No seating in arrivals in t3  while waiting for check in desk,4
3711,"Not really a meet and greet but very close, easy and quick.",4
3712,Very convenient car park and easy to book online.,4
3713,Excellent airport terminal parking.  We wouldn't park elsewhere now.,5
3714,Cut the staff trying to flog you duty free and other garbage that you don’t want and employ more immigration and baggage staff to provide the service that you do!,2
